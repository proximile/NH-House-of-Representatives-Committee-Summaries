doing my committee for executive session
 
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
about five minutes ago but I felt like
 
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
it was really important for me to come
 
00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
here and introduce this bill to how I
 
00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 align:start position:0%
came to this movement and why I feel
 
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 align:start position:0%

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
tradition of trying to do uh as a
 
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.010 align:start position:0%
tradition of trying to do uh as a
courtesy

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 align:start position:0%

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the last time that we spoke
 
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
I went into some detail about the
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
various protections over the Article 5
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
convention process that uh you see from
 
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
the from the States from the courts and
 
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
from um and from the uh the Congress as
 
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
well uh this bill is specifically
 
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
um to deal with the protections that the
 
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
states have over the process
 
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
um and we've seen in uh numerous
 
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 align:start position:0%
instances in various processes including
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
within the Constitution including
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
several types of constitutional
 
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.850 align:start position:0%
several types of constitutional
conventions

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
um States having direct control over
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
their delegates we saw that as I
 
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned last time
 
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
um in states with control over the
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
article 7 over their delegates to
 
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
article seven conventions that ratified
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution we saw that as the
 
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
story I told played a huge role here in
 
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it was also in play
 
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
um in about half of the other states
 
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 align:start position:0%
that ratified the US Constitution and
 
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and uh
 
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
quite several others um
 
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
the the and uh in addition when the time
 
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
came for the use of the other convention
 
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
type under Article 5 the Article 5
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
ratifying convention uh nearly every
 
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 align:start position:0%
state I think all but maybe two of them
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
had some sort of language that limited
 
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
their delegates uh to the will of the
 
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.670 align:start position:0%
their delegates uh to the will of the
people

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.410 align:start position:0%
people
um

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
and that same type of language is what
 
00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
led to this kind of Bill here we've seen
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
about a dozen states or so across the
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
U.S past similar
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
um similar bills in the last few years
 
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0%
and there's been an increased activity
 
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
in that specifically since 2020 won the
 
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
case of CIO follow V Washington came
 
00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 align:start position:0%
down unanimously from the Supreme Court
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
upholding exactly the type of delegate
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
protection language that is in both this
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
which goes deep into specifically the
 
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
Article 5 Convention as well as the same
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
language that's in reporchella's bill
 
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
that goes broadly in all different types
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Interstate conventions
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the biggest point of contention in uh
 
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
in different bills generally there's a
 
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
very broad agreement of this set of
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
principles that should be in these bills
 
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's very broadly bipartisan of what the
 
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
different protections are that one
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
should have the biggest point of
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
contention is generally whether
 
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
delegates should be elected or appointed
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion and and I spoke to rep
 
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh rep Newell about this and she also
 
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
agrees uh that it's better for delegates
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be elected than appointed indeed both
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
are possible
 
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 align:start position:0%
um other Interstate conventions have
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
delegates that are appointed but uh
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
nearly every convention that has
 
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
occurred under the U.S Constitution had
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
delegates that were elected that's the
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
article article 7 ratifying conventions
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of the states had their elect had
 
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
their delegates elected
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact they opened up the Democracy
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
more than they typically would and and
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
didn't limit it to just property holders
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
it was still you know racist and sexist
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
but at least the property holder
 
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
restriction was was lifted in quite a
 
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
few states to allow the process to be
 
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
more open to the public in Massachusetts
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
there was so much demand for uh for
 
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
attention over this process that was so
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
open that they could and hold it in the
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
state house because it wasn't big enough
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
for all the people who wanted to come
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
and watch they had to use the largest
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
building in the in the state of
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at the time in order to
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
hold the the convention there so that
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
people could see and participate and
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
that pretty well characterized
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
um the level of interest and openness
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
that people had over this process and
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
among the reasons why elections are are
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
so helpful here
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
when you have a whole bunch of people
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
who are very interested in a single
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
issue that tends to help give the
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
elections an additional layer of
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
security that they don't always have
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with Congressional
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
elections or other elections where
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's multiple issues at play people
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
who are paying attention and have strong
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
opinions on one particular issue their
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
vote tends to much better reflect the
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
actual views of the public rather than
 
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
when you have wedge issues and divisive
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
topics and things like that in play and
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
the election process and that's why this
 
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
Bill calls for the use of Elections for
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
that this bill also follows the the
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
language that's already in the existing
 
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 align:start position:0%
state law here in New Hampshire
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
surrounding your own State
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional conventions indeed it
 
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
takes the the section of your of the New
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire code and just builds right
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
onto that to add in addition the two
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
other types of conventions in which New
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire May participate both the state
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions which New
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has previously had a law about
 
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 align:start position:0%
back in 1933 as well as the Article 5
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
proposing convention
 
00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.210 align:start position:0%
proposing convention
um

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
and the yeah the other protections that
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
it builds in it adds penalties but it
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
only adds criminal penalties in the very
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
specific circumstance where somebody is
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
intentionally trying to use this process
 
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh to overthrow our government this is
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
something that there is no reason to
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
believe is possible to do successfully
 
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
for all of the reasons that I've said
 
00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 align:start position:0%
before but we thought that it made sense
 
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
for the attempt to do so to have some
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
additional penalty even though there's
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
no possibility that it would actually be
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
successful that would be Insurrection I
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
believe under the 14th Amendment and so
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
it calls for the penalty that that is
 
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
there for Insurrection under the 14th
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is to be barred from
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
public office uh to give you an example
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
of what kinds of things do or or would
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
or would not qualify we saw a case in
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
Florida in 2008 that I mentioned last
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
time Ford V Browning where there were
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
delegates who had an uh to a limited
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
state State Convention there who had an
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
honest disagreement about what their
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
limitations were if that were the case
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
here those delegates would see their
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
votes invalid and they would see
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
themselves replaced but the disagreement
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
was clearly honest there'd be no chance
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
of any criminal penalties there you
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
would have to prove Beyond a reasonable
 
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
doubt that people had the intention to
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
not only violate their oath but also to
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
do so in a way that was specifically
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
intended to overthrow the federal
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
government so it just adds that extra
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
level of protection that we've not seen
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
in other similar bills basically
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
everything else that's in here is in
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
various similar bills and the language
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
is very similar to the language that's
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
already in your your code for State
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
conventions as well as similar to the
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
language that's in uh repercelli's bill
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's intended to apply more broadly
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
across different types of of Interstate
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
meetings and with that I'm happy to take
 
00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
say thank you Sam so this language is
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
rolling or proposed language rules into
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
irsa 667 colon one which is existing
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
statute so I'm looking at the proposed
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
language there's a lot of language
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
some of it uh amends some gender type uh
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
issues which which is understandable
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
having put a a bill in before that
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
changed one word
 
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and that was a chore when there's
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
this many words or phrases or things it
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to look at all this
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
of course that's our job
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but I I want to ask you uh this this
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
afternoon we're going to have an
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB 269
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
relative to limiting The Authority of
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire delegates to policy making
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
conventions now that is related it looks
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
to me like it's related to what's the
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh it looks so my question is
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
are you are you familiar with 269 that
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at and I
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
testified and supported that one as well
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought so
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh could you explain to us the the
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
difference in intent between 269 which
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec this afternoon and
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh 392 which we just heard introduced
 
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh 392 which we just heard introduced
sure

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the 269 is intended to be Ezra
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
Porcelli indicated that one is intended
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
to be more Broad and this one is
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
intended to be more deep uh Bill 269 is
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
intended to apply to all types of
 
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
Interstate policy making conventions
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
whereas this um specifically deals with
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
the Article Five the two types of
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
conventions in Article Five both the
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
proposing and the ratifying conventions
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
there is a slight overlap because the
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
Article 5 proposing convention is both
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and in that case I spoke to Red
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
Porcelli and there's only one point
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
where the two bills disagree which is
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
the method of choosing delegates and
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
alternates uh her Bill calls for them to
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
be done by appointment which makes sense
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
for all types of interstate compacts
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the article 5
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
proposing convention
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
um because in in general that's the way
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
it has been for all other all types of
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts other than ones
 
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:26.420 align:start position:0%
within the cost institution itself
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
and she is all right with I I mean I
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for her but my
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
understanding is that she's all right
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill superseding hers uh in
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
that one area where they conflict where
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
this one calls for the election of those
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh same uh same representatives and
 
00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:44.569 align:start position:0%
uh same uh same representatives and
delegates

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
delegates
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
right so you just pointed out one area
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
where you use the Expression conflict
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
and that that's what I'm trying to get
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
to is is is there a conflict between 392
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
and two in 269 both of which it sounds
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
like you you approved I do or support
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
you've testified for both of them
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the area of conflict uh we need to
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
drill down on that over the next few
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
days before we exec on this but you'd
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to do it now we have some other
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
folks who'd like to speak but if if you
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
could uh for me or for us uh if you
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind having testified in both
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
of these if you could address the what
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
you just pointed out as a conflict
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
between the two measures so that we can
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
try to reconcile that if you could maybe
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
shoot an email at some point yeah
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh yeah and I've spoken to
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
both Representatives Newell and
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Porcelli and my
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they're uh they're
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
both all right with uh this bill
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
superseding the other one in that one
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
narrow area of Elections versus
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
appointments specifically for the
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Article 5 proposing convention so if
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
reportcelli's Bill is the only one that
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
passes it would stand if they both pass
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
then on that one point of law this one
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
would supersede that
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you because we're gonna have to
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
reconcile that difference I we I don't
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
see this committee recommending passage
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
of two different measures that where
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict between two of them
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
between wording so that's what we need
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
to address and yeah I would I would
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment something to the
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
effect of
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um notwithstanding something in section
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
the the one that is referenced in uh in
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
the other Bill to the contrary
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
this that I I would recommend an
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that says
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
right so if you could uh and it's up to
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
you if you want to address that
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
um that would help us to try to
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
reconcile that because you obviously
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
have some some great background in this
 
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.490 align:start position:0%
have some some great background in this
area

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for that from wolf pack
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
pack being Pac quite other questions for
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
Miss fieldman uh representative
 
00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:52.069 align:start position:0%
Miss fieldman uh representative
Charlotte

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
Charlotte
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
being with us again today
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
um I think you mentioned in your
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
testimony that article 7 said ratified
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
and delegates could either be elected or
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
appointed it doesn't specify a in
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
article 7 how the the delegates are to
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
be chosen uh the different states all
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
um past laws for how that would happen
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I believe all of them I I might be
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I believe all of them went
 
00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:22.019 align:start position:0%
with elections for the article 7
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions Mr chair sure a
 
00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:25.910 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions Mr chair sure a
follow-up

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
um but doesn't the Constitution say
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's another means of ratifying an
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that being the state
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislature uh isn't that the tradition
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
in this state that at the legislature
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
that will vote on ratification and not a
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
separate ratifying group sure uh article
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
7 was specifically to ratify the U.S
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution itself that's a separate
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
provision from the provision for
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
ratifying amendments for ratifying
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendments that's a type of convention
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's in Article 5 itself and 26 of the
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
27 Amendments that we have were ratified
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
by the state legislatures which is one
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the two procedures in Article 5 for
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
ratification station the other procedure
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
was used only once for the 20 uh 21st
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.410 align:start position:0%
was used only once for the 20 uh 21st
Amendment

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know people at the time were
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
worried because nobody had ever had an
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention before in this
 
00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:15.710 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention before in this
country

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
um but the the supporters really wanted
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention they pushed real
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
hard for Article 5 ratifying conventions
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
and Congress ultimately proposed that we
 
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
ratify it with Article 5 proposing
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
conventions which is their right to do
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
under our under Article Five
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
um and even without
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
um bills in place in the states for how
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
to limit their delegates all of the
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
states were able to figure out and they
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
were able to figure it out very quickly
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is prevent the the
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
difficulties that the states faced at
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
that time where they had to ratify where
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
they had to propose new laws and all
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
figured out from scratch very quickly
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
this allows us to have in place the gold
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
standard for what that language should
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
look like ahead of time so whether you
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
support or oppose the use of the article
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
5 convention process I think we can all
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
agree that it's better to have language
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
in place ahead of time uh in in case
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
there is an article 5 convention whether
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
you want there to be one or not so that
 
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
we know what that process will look like
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
and in fact I gave you a letter from uh
 
00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:23.899 align:start position:0%
then sender now President Joe Biden
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
supporting a similar type of measure in
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the U.S Senate I passed the the Senate
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
unanimously in this form and was
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
supported by people like Chuck Schumer
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
and Mitch McConnell in addition to Joe
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
Biden um
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
in fact Chuck Schumer was one of the
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
main authors of the report that uh that
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh Joe Biden wrote the letter on
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh that just was intended to uh
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
in in Joe Biden's letter you can see
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
even though he didn't support the use of
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
the convention process himself and I
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
think he was mistaken on that he still
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
supported this type of Regulation over
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
the process so that there would be more
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
certainty in it thank you
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
oh as I've pointed out we are going to
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
exec 269 this afternoon and don't know
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
how that's going to go until we actually
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
vote on it and discuss it in an
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
executive session if it does pass again
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
to my earlier concern you know if if
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
this is turns out to be a good measure
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
that that people want to support uh
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
we're going to need need some help to
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
reconcile some language here so that
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
this can get Fair consideration in a
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
week from today when we exact
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
um 392. uh 21st amendment was
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
Prohibition repeal correct yes so that's
 
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:41.900 align:start position:0%
that's the only amendment that has been
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
ratified in a different process real
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
real quick could you just speak to that
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
why that amendment ratification was
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
different uh yeah the activists involved
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
didn't want to send back to the States
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
an amendment to repeal uh an amendment
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
that the states had not that long before
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
voted to ratify
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so there was a lot of concern over
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
the process there were also people who
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
were pushing for the use of the article
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
5 convention process to propose it for a
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
similar reason because they were worried
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
that Congress had just proposed an
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
amendment and would be hard-pressed for
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
Congress to uh to overturn it and it
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
took a Monumental movement in this
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
country uh there's a great organization
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
women's Organization for national
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
prohibition reform among other efforts
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
um that uh that helped turned around
 
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.810 align:start position:0%
um that uh that helped turned around
Congress

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
um along with of course the Great
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
Depression which was the huge triggering
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
event helped turn around Congress
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
um but part of the the deal that they
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
made with those coalitions was not to
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
put the states in a position to change
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
the views that they had just had in
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
their state legislatures but rather to
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
let the people directly decide and they
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
knew it was a big deal there was
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering at the time in fact the
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
first one to spread convention fears
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
broadly and in a way that was false was
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
Wayne Wheeler who's one of the most
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
famous propagandists in the country and
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
he was spreading fears of an article 5
 
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.390 align:start position:0%
he was spreading fears of an article 5
convention

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
um way back then
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
but they happened and it was they knew
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
it was a big deal at the time the state
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
of Utah even called in uh a national
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
radio broadcast they were the last state
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
to hold their convention and they
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
delayed ratification to call in a
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
national radio broadcast which in 1933
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
was very difficult and actually have a
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
picture of the article 5 convention in
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
Utah when they ratified there that's a
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
very thorough answer and I love the
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
history and uh would love to stay with
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
that but we need to roll on here any any
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Sam fieldman
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
uh sure
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is this what is
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
different about this bill is it proposed
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
the delegates be elected and one of the
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
themes I've heard underlying themes of
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
all of these bills for Article 5
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
conventions is the concern about money
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
in politics so in having elected
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
delegates how do you control
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
the money that's behind it that's the
 
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
the great thing about a single issue
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
election and in particular the
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
convention that wolf pack is pushing for
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
a convention that deals specifically
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
with the issue of money in politics has
 
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
an extra added protection that the
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
others do not
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
um but in any type of single issue
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
single issue election uh the influence
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
of money is smaller and in an election
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
where the single issue is the corrupting
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
influence of money in politics itself uh
 
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
then this spending large amounts of
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
money in the election can sometimes even
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
hurt rather than help and we've seen
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
that in elections on both sides of the
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
aisle we saw that when Benjamin Brad
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
beat Eric Cantor we saw that when
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
Alexandria ocasio-cortez beat Joseph
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
Crowley we saw that just recently in the
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
New Jersey uh State Senate when um when
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
um an unknown truck driver at Durr beat
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
the the uh president of the Senate uh
 
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.870 align:start position:0%
the the uh president of the Senate uh
Sweeney

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
Sweeney
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
um when when the issue was in politics
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
it ends up being counter effective but
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
some degree of that protection is in
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
place whenever you have a
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
well-publicized which this would
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
certainly be election especially limited
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
to a single issue
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Sam we need to roll on I
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
do before I lose you I do want to point

before uh I or we are very interested in
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%

um and I'm here in support of HB 392
um

00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
for the last seven years I volunteer
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
with a group called wolf pack
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
um its goal is an amendment to the U.S
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution to address the corrupting
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
influence of money and politics
 
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.149 align:start position:0%
influence of money and politics
um

00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
I was frustrated with the lack of a
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
representation in our federal government
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the realization that the vast
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
majority of the bills being passed
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
directly benefited special interests
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
pouring money into our elections they
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
have basically captured every branch of
 
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:16.580 align:start position:0%
our government
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
I began searching for organizations that
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
were working on this issue and and were
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
fighting back and wolf pack stood out to
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
me on all those organizations as having
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the most effective and verified method
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
of getting the change by means of an
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
article 5 U.S convention uh Convention
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
of the U.S Constitution
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
of being a form of a librarian though I
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
had to do my own research I never take
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
anything at face value I have to look it
 
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
up I have to see the evidence for myself
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
so after searching through many
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed reports on Article 5 and
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
the State Convention process one common
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
theme between all of those reports
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
became clear
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
that this is a safe process and though
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's never been used it serves as a
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
check and balance to ensure that it's
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
limited to one address that is called
 
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:12.419 align:start position:0%
and furthermore it has been an effective
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
proven tool to put pressure on a corrupt
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
Congress to make change and that is the
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
17th Amendment we they had no intention
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
of having direct election of senators
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
and it took the states pressuring them
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
through an article 5 convention call to
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
make them do the right thing and have us
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
directly elect our Senators so that was
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
the people power bring pressure now that
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
being said with all these checks and
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
balances that we have in the Article 5
 
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.590 align:start position:0%
balances that we have in the Article 5
convention

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that this bill should be
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
supported because any uh amount of Extra
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
Protection we can put on the process and
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
any transparency that we can put on the
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
process on how it's being called how
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
it's being done I think is a good thing
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
and puts a lot of people's minds at ease
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
with this process so that is why I'm
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
here supporting this bill
 
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.289 align:start position:0%
here supporting this bill
um

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
I feel like we are in a cage of our own
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
making right now
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
um that cage is made out of fear
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
fear of a process that we don't
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
understand pure process that is unknown
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
um but that fear is created by the
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
people that want to keep us in that cage
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
um it is it is amazing to me that the
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
one process that we have to put a check
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
on all three branches of government that
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
the people can use is somehow the most
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous and that we can't use it and I
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
just don't feel like that is the truth I
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
um we can unlock that cage and walk out
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
we have the method the founders gave us
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
the method to do that
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and I feel like we are
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
um negligent in not using it and not
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
bringing this country back to a
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Republic that it belongs
 
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.269 align:start position:0%
representative Republic that it belongs
um

00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
so finally I'll leave the committee with
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
a final word urgency
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
um every day that we do not act our
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
Democratic Republic slips a little
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
further away
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
um every day we allow lobbyists to roam
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the halls of the state house or special
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
interests to drown the voices of average
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
citizens with money we break our Oaths
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
and pledges The Pledge I just took this
 
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
morning and the old two took of office
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
we violate that oath every day that we
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
delay my son is now 15 years old and
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
every day I fight for him to live in a
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
country where his voice matters
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
and that his voice when he turns 18 will
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
count for something and I hope that you
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in this room too are fighting as
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
well for him
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I again respectfully thank everyone
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
on this committee for your Devotion to
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:49.940 align:start position:0%
um and for hearing my testimony today
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to answer any questions
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Benavides did you say do I
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly that the threat
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
of an article 5 convention has helped is
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
what helped prod Congress to pass the
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
17th Amendment yeah we came within one
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
state at that time
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
um of of calling an article 5 convention
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and every step of the way uh Congress at
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
that point said no absolutely not but as
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
soon as we got to within one state they
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
changed their mind and then they they
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
proposed the amendment to directly elect
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
our Senators
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
so your point then if I understand you
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
correctly is that the existence of an
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
article 5 option uh is what brought
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
about the traditional adoption of the
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
17th Amendment is that kind of what
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah because the the
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
before that time senators were directly
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
elected and it was based it was called
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
at that time the millionaires Club you
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a senator without being a
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
millionaire even back then
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so uh so there was a lot of
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
corruption involved and they were not
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to change that but they were
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
pressured to and I think the same thing
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not a fortune teller I
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen um but
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
I feel like if Congress has given the
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
choice to give up power
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
or to do the right thing they will
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately do the right thing now that
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
might not be true I have no idea but in
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
either in either scenario we get what we
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
want we either get an amendment to fix
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
the corruption corrupting influence of
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
money through Congress or we call the
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
convention and get the amendment
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves so either way I feel like it's
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
to win-win
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for that other questions
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kerry
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
so in creating delegates to this
 
00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
so in creating delegates to this
convention

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
I mean ordinarily the people who
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
represent us in Congress are voted on by
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
all the voters does creating delegates
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
to a convention create sort of super
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
delegates who supersede the rights of
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
the individual to vote
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe so because
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
um the on the state level when we were
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
point to delegates these delegates are
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
restricted they're restricted only to
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
the subject at hand they can't go to the
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
election and supersede the votes of the
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
people and even in under current Law
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
Without these binding resolutions that
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
are in this bill
 
00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:22.010 align:start position:0%
are in this bill
um

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to if someone goes off
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
the rails and and have done in the past
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
for other types of conventions we can
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
recall those delegates so if they're
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
doing something that we don't uh that
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
are not representative of the people of
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we can recall them and
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
send other delegates in their place
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so that's the that's the that's what
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
we have currently what this bill does is
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
ADD even more protections for the people
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to make sure that those
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
delegates are in fact you uh carrying
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
out the will of the New Hampshire
 
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.549 align:start position:0%
out the will of the New Hampshire
citizens

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
Cena and thank you so much Mr Benavides
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh Ken Quinn is asked for five minutes
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill and um
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
if any of the points that you were going
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
to make Mr Quinn have been made
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
you can feel free to not repeat them
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking for some some new some new
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
testimony here thank you for and welcome
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
back thank you so much Mr chair and
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I agree I don't
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
want to repeat anything I've said in my
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
previous testimony or what you've
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
already heard I'm just encouraged by
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
seeing this level of activity to get to
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
a convention and so I highly support
 
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.649 align:start position:0%
a convention and so I highly support
HP

00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:38.659 align:start position:0%
HP
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
392 as you know I'm working to get to
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
such a convention and I've been
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
testifying now in front of this
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
committee for close to 10 years and it's
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
been this fear of how will a convention
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
play out that has in my opinion from
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
what I see in here has been what's
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
stopping us from getting a passage on a
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
article 5 application
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
I want to just share
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
kind of what I've been seeing in those
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
10 years we really have become a country
 
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
of two groups and I'm not talking about
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
the political parties
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
we have become
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
positioned on two sides one side is both
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
parties trying to work together which we
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
desperately need to introduce reforms at
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
the federal level to start fixing the
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
problems we're facing as a nation that's
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
the group I belong to
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
we need to come together on some issues
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
that we can agree on our country
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
desperately needs that
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
the other group
 
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:39.860 align:start position:0%
are both sides coming together to stop
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
and silence the voice of the American
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
people to stop needed reforms from being
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
from being introduced those are the two
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
camps we all fall into today
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
and I encourage I hope that all of you
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
here who fall into the group that I
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
belong to that would like to see some
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
reforms that are agreed upon by
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
both sides of the political issue side
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's what we need in fact I want to
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
use an example the 1787 Federal
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
convention is typically used as the
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
example of an article 5 convention well
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
that's just simply wrong we've heard
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
that there's never been a convention
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
before that has proposed amendments that
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
is simply wrong and I want to set the
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
record straight
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
and this is phenomenal history in 1861
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
the nation was heading to a civil war
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
Virginia called a convention to propose
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
amendments to the Constitution to
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
prevent the war from breaking out
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
so we have had one of these conventions
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
the country was divided as you all know
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
21 states sent Commissioners to
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
Washington D.C they met in Willard's
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
Hotel on February 4th they were there
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
for three weeks
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
they drafted the rules they appointed
 
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.190 align:start position:0%
they drafted the rules they appointed
um

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
I figured the name of the President
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
Tyler who was the former president
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
United States as the president of this
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
convention they drafted several
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
amendments dealing with the slavery
 
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:09.409 align:start position:0%
amendments dealing with the slavery
issue

00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
now because it was not called under
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
Article Five this is the only difference
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
because two-thirds of the states did not
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
apply for it they could not have it
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
proposed directly to the state so Tyler
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
walked over to Congress and delivered
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the amendments to Congress to have
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
Congress propose it and then Senate out
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
for ratification
 
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.710 align:start position:0%
for ratification
foreign

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
the war broke out shortly thereafter and
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
we know the rest of history but this
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
process works in fact the rules that we
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
have seen in many of the conventions
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
since then are the very rules adopted at
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
the 1861 was known as the Washington
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
peace conference and New Hampshire sent
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
delegates I think one of your delegates
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
was Amos tuck that's one of the
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
individuals from from this state
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
um in fact I want to read to you Maine's
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
commission this was from commission to
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
Maine and it deals directly with this
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation here's the
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
commission from 1861 and it says this
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
said Commissioners to be subject at all
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
times to the control of the legislatures
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
so right here from history we have
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
evidence that in a convention that's
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
proposing an Amendment to the US
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution that the Commissioners are
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
under control of the state legislature
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
at all times that is what this
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
resolution before you does you control
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
them and in order to back up that
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
control you have some teeth to it which
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
I like to see I think that's a good idea
 
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.750 align:start position:0%
I like to see I think that's a good idea
lastly

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to just add that Justice
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
Scalia antonine Scalia he he was in
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
favor of an article 5 convention he was
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
against a constitutional convention but
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
he was in favor of an article 5
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
convention and he figured out and you
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
can watch this in his own testimony that
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
he figured out and determined only two
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
percent of the American people can stop
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
and Amendment to the US Constitution and
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
he wanted the stage to have an article 5
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
convention to actually revise Article 5
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for the states to
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
propose amendments and as I was driving
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
down I was thinking about our Amendment
 
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.790 align:start position:0%
down I was thinking about our Amendment
history

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
our constitution has been in effect now
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
for 235 years
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
we have 27 Amendments 33 have been
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
proposed so that averages out to 10 and
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
a half years per amendment when you
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
count the Bill of Rights being won
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
because they were proposed at the same
 
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
because they were proposed at the same
time

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
so if the average
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
is 10 and a half years for an amendment
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
to be proposed
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
I want to put this out to you
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
the last time an amendment to the U.S
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution has been proposed has been
 
00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:46.579 align:start position:0%
52 years ago
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
52 years ago
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
the Constitution was designed to keep up
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
with the progress and that's what the
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
amending provision is for as as progress
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
changes we need to address that with
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
reforms that amendment was allowing 18
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
year olds to vote we have not had an
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
now I ask you in the last 52 years has
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
our society changed
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
I would say quite drastically
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
has our constitution kept up with the
 
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.250 align:start position:0%
has our constitution kept up with the
progress

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
I would say not even close
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
that is what this process allows us to
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
do Congress refuses to introduce the
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
needed reforms on many issues that we
 
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.990 align:start position:0%
needed reforms on many issues that we
need

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's time for the American Voice the
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
American the voice of the American
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
people to be heard this is what this
 
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.250 align:start position:0%
people to be heard this is what this
does

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
in its time and I I highly encourage you
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
to support this and
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I will be here
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
to take those and I I like the idea of
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
maybe seeing what needs to be changed so
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
that one of these can be passed with
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
that covers what you need I'll take a
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
look at it as well if I can help and
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
lastly if you are interested in the
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules of the 21st amendment on how the
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
states convene these ratifying
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
conventions uh there's a recommended
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%

00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
believe you mentioned the name Amos tuck
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
and it's somewhat ironic that I look out
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
the window it's the New Hampshire
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%

pointed out uh this measure uh likely
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
needs some mending and if I I know the
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%

um good morning representative Moffett
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh thank
 
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:38.579 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak with
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
you today my name is Debbie Augustine
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
and I live in Kentucky New Hampshire I'm
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
here to ask you to support House Bill
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
392 relative to Constitutional
 
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:51.500 align:start position:0%
Convention procedures for delegates
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
since I retired in June of 2020 I've
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
been volunteering with wolf pack
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
by the time my granddaughter was born 10
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
years ago I had had it with congress's
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
Shameless corruption and its allegiance
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
to their special interest donors and I
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
realized that it's not okay for congress
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
people to spend up to 70 percent of
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
their time fundraising for their next
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
elections when they should be doing the
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
people's work
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
after all our children's democracy
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
should not belong to the highest bidders
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 392 spells out the regulatory
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
process for delegates of an article 5
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
Convention of the U.S Constitution such
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
a constitution could address campaign
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
Finance reform by means of a
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will expedite a
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
state-sled effort to pressure Congress
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
into dealing with a systemic corruption
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
entrench in our politics
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
besides it's a sure bet that Congress
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
won't be passing its own anti-corruption
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
any Bill anytime soon
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
they can't even ban insider trading for
 
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
they can't even ban insider trading for
themselves

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
passing 392 will show we need business
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to business as usual
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire along with the rest of the
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
States has the power to pressure
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
Congress into fixing our badly broken
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system but only if we
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
use it
 
00:40:22.089 --> 00:40:22.099 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your services
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
legislators and respectfully urge you to
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
support this very important legislation
 
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.010 align:start position:0%
support this very important legislation
thanks

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions for
 
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions for
Augustine

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
Augustine
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I thank you again and now we do have
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
at least one more pink card from one of
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ellen Reed I
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
represent New Market and new Fields
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10.
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
um I will keep my uh you have seen for
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
those of you have been on this committee
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
for multiple terms you've seen this
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
issue repeatedly I'm going to keep my
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
remarks briefed so as not to go into
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
what other people have said not to go
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
into what you've surely heard over the
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
years but
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
um so I want to address primarily two
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
arguments against this bill or any other
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
similar bill that you may have heard and
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
may hear in the future one and they're
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of conflicting arguments actually
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention has never happened
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is not something that we need to
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
address it's probably never going to
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
happen and the other argument is that
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
passing something like this would
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood of us going to
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention and thereby
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
running the risk of the notorious
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
runaway convention so the first one is
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
it going to happen is it likely to
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
happen my answer is it's coming
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
um I do a lot of work in polarization
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
my background has been an election law
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
despite me being on the fish and game
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee and uh what we've seen from
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
multiple studies on the national level
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
is that the polarization we're
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing right now in this country
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
the extreme polarization
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
um there's people who say it's kind of a
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
blip or it's like the natural ebb and
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
flow of democracies it is not it has
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
increased polarization and divisiveness
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
has increased over the last many decades
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
and we are getting to a Tipping Point
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
in fact there is more and more talk
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
whereas I know when I was a child or a
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
young person it would have been
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
Unthinkable to talk about uh violent
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
um uprisings in our country and yet
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's become a normal topic of
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
conversation and I need to point out
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
that this is not one side both sides of
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
the political
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
ideology are furious at our government
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
are unhappy
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
and just to quote Jefferson if you would
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
allow me to quote the Declaration of
 
00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:05.210 align:start position:0%
allow me to quote the Declaration of
Independence

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
Independence
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's only so much that we can take of
 
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:08.780 align:start position:0%
that anger before something happens
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
Prudence indeed will dictate that
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
governments long established should not
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
be changed for light and transient
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
causes and accordingly all experience
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
hath shown that mankind are more
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
disposed to suffer while Evils are
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
sufferable than to write themselves by
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
abolishing the forms to which they are
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
accustomed but when a long train of
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
abuses and usurpations pursuing
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
invariably the same object events is
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
designed to reduce them under absolute
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
despotism it is their right it is their
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
duty to throw off such government and to
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
provide new guards for their future
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
security and that is what we are rapidly
 
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.809 align:start position:0%
security and that is what we are rapidly
approaching

00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
approaching
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
one of the things that people again on
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
both sides are looking for to avoid
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
something like that is an article Vive
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
convention to reform the government that
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
they see as oppressive
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
now how close are we not only are we
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
increasing in that polarization and
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
increasing in that unhappiness but as
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know 34 states are required to call
 
00:44:10.329 --> 00:44:10.339 align:start position:0%
a convention
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
over the years 400 calls have been made
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
and we would have already had a
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
convention had the language lined up had
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
it happened in in the right time frame
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
but just currently in the convention of
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
States push which has gained quite a bit
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
of momentum they're already up to 19
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
states that have adopted that particular
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
language the BBA amendment is already up
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
to 28 so six states away from calling an
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention and so my point is
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
this that we could repeal our current
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
call and never pass a call New Hampshire
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
could never pass a call and still be
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
called into a convention within a few
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
years so we need a way to handle that
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
going back to the point about the need
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
for an article 5 convention
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
I look at it like medicine while there
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
are risks to an article 5 uh convention
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
being sick being a patient if you're
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
healthy you're not likely to undergo a
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
risky procedure or take a medicine that
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
has severe side effects but when you get
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
into a really disparate situation
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
you'll do something experimental you'll
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
undergo a surgery because you see no
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
other choice and again that's where we
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
are going the language in this
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
particular bill just to bring it back to
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is been very well vetted by
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
multiple organizations dealing with
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
national uh and different States
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire's arguments I
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
think it is extremely thorough and
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
thoughtful it removes politics from the
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
determining of the delegates it prevents
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
our contribution at least to a runaway
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
convention we can't control other states
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and what other states delegates do and
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
it holds our delegates accountable
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
um whenever I think a committee has a
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
good idea before it in the form of
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
multiple bills as you do now I think
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's a good uh rule of thumb to pass one
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
and retain the other for study so that
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
you get a second bite at the Apple the
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
following year I would recommend that I
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
do prefer this language I understand it
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
is more complex than your other bill
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so I would ask that you pass this one
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
and retain the other one and make
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
amendments to the other one should this
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
one not pass the Senate however if you
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable with the simpler
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
language I am I've already offered to
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
Wolf Pack to work on Amendment language
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
for either Bill and you could pass that
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
one and retain this one and study the
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
more complex one over the the fall
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
either way I do think that we really
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
need to act because it's kind of getting
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
scary out there and with that I will
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
represent Finney
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate you being here
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about some language
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bill I'm on page eight
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 15.
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I just want a point of of some
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
clarification if you will
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it seems like lines nine through
 
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:14.420 align:start position:0%
fifteen one a a uh
 
00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.309 align:start position:0%
fifteen one a a uh
they're

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
um it was a felony charge for violating
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
whatever oath you that you would take as
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
a delegate to this convention now is
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
this based specifically on RSA 641 1A
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um because I don't I don't see the uh
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
the actual like um the class charge in
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
here and I I kind of have have like a
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
two-part question here
 
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.130 align:start position:0%
two-part question here
um

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
part the first in article 10 of our of
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
our state constitution allows us the
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
right to Revolution would you then agree
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
that any person that would make some
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
like Insurrection type statement or a
 
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.910 align:start position:0%
like Insurrection type statement or a
vote

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:55.940 align:start position:0%
um would be considered treasonous
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
which doesn't seem to be the case here
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to guess
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
clarification on on what it is the
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
felony specifically charging if if the
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
delegate um was to go back on whatever
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
that they're charged to do with this
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
convention sure so first of all a
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
delegate that in this case would run to
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
be a delegate or offered to be appointed
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
as a delegate is agreeing to a certain
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
set of rules so it's they they're
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
already agreeing to that the felony so
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to put on my criminal
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
justice hat for a second we have four
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
mental States of uh criminal culpability
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's uh negligent
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Reckless knowing and purposeful so that
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
depends on how much thought and you know
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
intent you've given to that crime
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
knowingly is the next to highest state
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
so a person would have to have not
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
recklessly not negligently but knew that
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
they were going against what they were
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
told to do and did it anyway knowing
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
that it would would be unethical
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
problematic what have you the right to
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
Revolution as I understand it in our New
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution is specific to
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so kind of different from
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.370 align:start position:0%
other questions
gagne

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
gagne
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh getting back to
 
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.050 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh getting back to
the

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
prior representative said uh
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of a felony okay here
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
two classes of felony which one are we
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
talking about here one is an A and A B
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
and your penalty is is significant my
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding and I am not a lawyer full
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure but having written a
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
significant number of bills with OLS my
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is when it says felony
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's up to the prosecution whether to
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
charge it as an ARB
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
follow up as you well know uh this is
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
like what you believe as you well know
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
Class B is three and a half to seven the
 
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
class A is seven and a half to Fifteen
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
there's quite a difference there for
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
just deciding to not you know I'm not
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to go along with the dictates of
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
what the convention we give thank you
 
00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:15.859 align:start position:0%
for the question we give prosecution
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
latitude in a lot of cases depending on
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
the evidence and the clear intent of the
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
person committing a crime I'm speaking
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
very broadly on all criminal cases
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
um but so would there be a reason to
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
have a difference between say somebody
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
who felt like got into the process was
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
at a convention and then felt a strong
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh moral internal obligation to go
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
against what they had promised and what
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
they had sworn to versus someone who
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
knowingly and purposefully went into
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
a sec declaring their oath saying that
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to hold to it but
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
purposely was trying to for example
 
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
overthrow the entire government
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
I think that is fair for prosecution to
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
make that claim however however I'm
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
already have offered to work on a number
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
of amendments with wolf pack on either
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
this bill or the other Bill and happy to
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
clarify that make a difference for
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
example between knowingly for class B
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
and purposefully for class A
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
purposefully as you know is or maybe you
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
don't know you're not in criminal
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
justice but you probably know requires a
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
very very very high threshold of proving
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
actual intent premeditated that's what I
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
would ask for
 
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.230 align:start position:0%
would ask for
right

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Russian Reed thank you Mr
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair and is there anyone else who wants
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
your needs to speak on this measure and
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
yes if you can be very succinct and give
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
us some clarification
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
um from wolf pack that uh that would be
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
appreciated I just wanted to point out
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
that as representative Reed said
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
um it would only be for those who
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
knowingly violate their oath and as
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed said somebody may
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
feel that they have a moral duty not to
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow the oath resignation is always an
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
option in that case and that's what
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
happened or what was offered to happen
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
in in the case
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
um that I had mentioned two weeks ago
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
where representative said they could not
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
follow their oath in the in the article
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
7 convention and gave the the town of uh
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
boscoin the chance to replace them if
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
they so chose in this case similarly if
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
you feel like you have a moral duty you
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
cannot follow your oath you can resign
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
and then you would not uh run the risk
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
of of any sort of felony if you know
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you are violating if you know that
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
you cannot follow your oath and then you
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
still act then I would think that would
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable cause for criminal
 
00:53:01.859 --> 00:53:08.690 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable cause for criminal
prosecution

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
just a brief question and I realized
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're running late
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
Justin having a felony in the build have
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
some of a chilling effect on a delegate
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it made more sense to make it a
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor a Class B if you wanted
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
someone incarcerated for a year but made
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
it a misdemeanor offense instead of a
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
very severe felony offense I don't know
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative Newell's position on that
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
personally I would yeah I know
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
personally I would be fine with an
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it a misdemeanor if
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's preferred by this committee I
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative renewal
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
agrees with that
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I I do think that one issue that has
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
come up before is making sure that
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
penalties are sufficient as a deterring
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
deterring effect and that has been an
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
argument that has been raised against
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
some uh language the um the strongest
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
deterrence though is the is the
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
provision to remove and replace somebody
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
to invalidate their votes and replace
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
them with somebody else because of that
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think that as strong a felony
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
deterrent effect is necessary so I'd be
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay with either way thank you for
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I point out
 
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Reed is still in the
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
house in terms of uh that possible
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
amending language uh that representative
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
shartliff alluded to and uh I do note
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
that you're saying the town of Boston uh
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
better every time you uh you you say
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's evolved native to New England from
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
the scouts yeah enough that I should be
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
able to from baskawan to Bosco and okay
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:44.099 align:start position:0%
I will call this uh calling into this
 
00:54:44.099 --> 00:54:45.549 align:start position:0%
I will call this uh calling into this
hearing

00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
on HB 392 I'm going to recess for about
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
one minute just one minute and then
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:35.829 align:start position:0%
 
00

00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
researcher and I asked her to do some
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
research on this uh this topic and this
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
issue and she's I've already seen her
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
initial uh work and she's passing this
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
out to the committee so we have a week
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
to process uh the research that she's
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
giving us and the testimony of which it
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
sounds like we'll have quite a lot of it
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
so we want to get smarter about this and
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh so right now we just want to listen
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
and we'll start with the prime sponsor
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%

honorable representatives and my
colleagues

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
um Kauai and the Lizzy Sally Gould and
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
wikiak massive
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
and in our Abenaki language I said hello
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
my name is Sherry Gould and I was born
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
in Peterborough and I live near Lake
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
massasicum in a little section of Warner
 
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
halfway between Bradford and haniker I'm
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
here as a representative of Merrimack
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
District 8. I was asked to run and I ran
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
in a very transparent manner
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
for this very opportunity to sit in this
 
00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:49.309 align:start position:0%
for this very opportunity to sit in this
seat

00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
for a very long time there has been a
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
barricaded door to recognition of
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
Abenaki people in New Hampshire
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
my goal is to do everything in my power
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
to get us through that door together
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
as a legislature and as an abanaki
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
Community as a whole
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
so I am a Mohegan tribal member enrolled
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the nohegan tribe 10 years ago when
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
we did the commission on Native Affairs
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Carr made an attempt
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
to recognize all labunaki in New
 
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.250 align:start position:0%
to recognize all labunaki in New
Hampshire

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
OLS chose to do a word replace and
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
change the word Abenaki to Native
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
American all throughout the bill once
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
again erasing abernaki from anything in
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature positive for us uh
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
since that time Vermont recognized four
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
bands for those of us who have always
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
been New Hampshire people who are still
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people who will die New
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people we were put in a
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
situation where it would be illegal for
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
us to continue to sell our baskets under
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
the Indian arts and crafts act or any
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
art and there were other
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
minor things affecting us if we were not
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a tribe as a genealogist I
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
am a professional genealogist I was
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
appointed as the first genealogist to
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
the commission on Native affairs
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Society of
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
genealogists and I had offered to help
 
00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:16.819 align:start position:0%
the nohegan ban with their genealogies
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
for their recognition process and became
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
clear that my family band was kin to the
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
nohegan family band and so it made sense
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
to enroll
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
affording me the protection that New
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire denied me as a resident and an
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
Abenaki person living in New Hampshire
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I am not a Vermont Indian I've never
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
been a Vermont Indian I am enrolled in a
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
tribe that affords me the protection
 
00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
this bill is now hegan's attempt and
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm presenting it as an elected
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
representative on behalf of nohegan to
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
show the state of New Hampshire that
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
there is a very simple path for State
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
recognition and to try to educate you
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
all about what that means
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
it does not uh when a tribe is applying
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
for recognition whether it's state
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
recognition or federal recognition each
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
tribe applies for themselves among the
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
Abenaki there is no overarching Abenaki
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
Nation we don't have a grand Council of
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
Abernathy we have individual bands and
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
there are many bands in New Hampshire
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to diminish any
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
other band it shows a path that makes it
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
possible for every band and this
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
committee has to decide what the
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
criteria is for recognition in New
 
01:00:32.339 --> 01:00:34.670 align:start position:0%
criteria is for recognition in New
Hampshire

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to briefly cover federally
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes that's done by the Bia
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Indian Affairs I've handed
 
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.289 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Indian Affairs I've handed
around

01:00:44.289 --> 01:00:44.299 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
a sheet to you all that shows
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
the web address whoops the web address
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
and all the criteria for federal
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
recognition you'll see at the top of the
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
handout that I put in State Rec if you
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
search those regulations those criteria
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
there is nothing mentioned anywhere
 
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:06.740 align:start position:0%
about State recognition the federal
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
requirements for recognition do not
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
reference State recognition
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
I've also handed out to you
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
from the National Conference of State
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislatures a sheet on state
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
recognition that outlines what state
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
recognition means it states in there
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
that there are some benefits to the
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
tribe for State recognition they're very
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
limited and there are four departments
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
federally that can bestow
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
um Can appropriate money to state
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes or to states that
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their state recognized
 
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.650 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their state recognized
tribes

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
tribes
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that's all outlined in this and I
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
know you all can read so I'm not going
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
to read it to you
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
State recognition oh I also distributed
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
to you earlier a law brief on
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
all of the state recognized tribes
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and how they achieve State
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
recognition so the state has the
 
01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
authority to recognize tribes they can
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
do it through many different means one
 
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
of which is
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
a resolution a simple resolution the
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
states reserve the right to bestow
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
whatever privileges or responsibilities
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
on a state recognized tribe they choose
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do so a simple resolution that is
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
simply acknowledging the historic and
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
cultural contributions that have
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
tribe we use the word band but tri-band
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
it means the same thing
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
that bestows no rights and
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities what it does do though
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
is it triggers these four federal
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
agencies to be able to release funds so
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
for example right now the Department of
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
Labor is sending all the job training
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
money for Native Americans to Vermont
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
because there's no entity in New
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's never
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
recognized anybody
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
so this simple resolution would free up
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be receiving that
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor money that's
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
currently going to Vermont
 
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.930 align:start position:0%
currently going to Vermont
so

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that pretty much covers I'll
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
take any questions at the end on the
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
federal and state it gives a path to
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
recognition it defines rights and
 
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and you've gotten the
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
historical information
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember each tribe
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
applies directly so any band can say do
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
do you know we want a resolution to
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
recognize us it is not in any way the
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
intention of HCR 7 to diminish anyone
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
else in New Hampshire we are not
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
um looking to do anything to hurt
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of historical
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
trauma and it's not just on the Abenaki
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
people it's on the subtler people
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
our band stayed in New Hampshire always
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the you know at contact Phillip stayed
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I've shared with you
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
the link to the 26-year committee that
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
studied the issue of Philip was he Chief
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't achieved did another band have
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
all the kind of weeds we can crawl in
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
that that historical trauma I didn't
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
mention I'm I have a master's degree in
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
social work my concentration was
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
Community psychology
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
so we see a great deal of trauma we see
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
a great deal of confusion fear on both
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
sides of this issue and what I'm telling
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
you is we really it really is much
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
simpler we always live together we
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
worked with our colleagues
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
Philip was friends with Thomas seems he
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
sold him the land today uh each band has
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
their colleagues that they work with
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
so uh I think we can get through this
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
barricaded door I think I believe we can
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
a few more comments uh we do have
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
nelhegan does have a non-profit in New
 
01:04:59.089 --> 01:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registered New Hampshire aha
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
you'll hear some testimony about that
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into a lot of it
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
um we have Abenaki Trails project we
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
started we've been doing a great deal of
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
work in the area from
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
um Hopkinton to Sunapee to the Monadnock
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
region so following the Kentucky River
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
and the Warner River with the Community
 
01:05:17.819 --> 01:05:19.130 align:start position:0%
and the Warner River with the Community
Partners

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
Partners
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only 12 St
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
States who have no state or federally
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe in the fact that I
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
handed out I listed the other states
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's New Hampshire has to
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
decide is this an illustrious list you
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of or is are you ready
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that the Abenaki people
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the various bands remnants who
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
survived are the original people of New
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and recognize that you
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
already have a path to recognize people
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
you can limit you have all the power and
 
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
authority we do I'm a representative too
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
to limit it's hard I have two hats here
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep them separate
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
um but we can do this we can do this
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
the language that were used in the
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
recognition is really no different than
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
the language that's already in RSA 12a
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
for the commission on Native Affairs
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
which I already told you a word replaced
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
took Abernathy out and put Native
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
American in but for recognition as I
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
told you each band needs to ask for the
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
recognition in their own name
 
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
recognition in their own name
um

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:24.980 align:start position:0%
so we can start to move ahead today
 
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:27.980 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
portal with the comments I think when I
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
left home it was
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
something like 215 and supportive and 95
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
opposing there's various points of law
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
being expressed by concerned citizens
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
which I'm really glad people are
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
bringing those up and people are looking
 
01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
at them I know this committee is going
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
to take a week to review all of this
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
I've provided some information to
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative shurt-lived regarding the
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions about threat or harm to other
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
tribes in Vermont which are are not the
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office has provided
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
some information the chief can speak to
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:08.809 align:start position:0%
that and
um

01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and other than that and and some issues
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
around you know is nohegan is it it's
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
almost as if it's become a popularity
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
contest this isn't a vote about which
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
band you like this is about is New
 
01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going to recognize our
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
original people and if we are are we
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to provide a path for every band
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
that can meet whatever criteria this
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee sets forth and I think that
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
sums it up I'll take some questions on
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
the history the genealogy any of those
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
kind of questions I probably can answer
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
those best but we'll have other experts
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
test on other areas so I may pass on
 
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.849 align:start position:0%
test on other areas so I may pass on
some

01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gold questions
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor representative
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
I just want to thank you for clarifying
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the committee that this will open the
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
door for other uh bands to apply because
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
when I was when I was reading it I was
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
questioning and of course you've gotten
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
emails from people as well about other
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
bands being included so thank you very
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
much for doing that thank you
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
Frozen Sherlock if you have a question
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
Representatives always good seeing you
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
um my question is a concern I have about
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
this bill being before this committee
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
um as representative Master Miller just
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
alluded to there'd be other bands could
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
come forward and seek recognition
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
through this Committee in the New
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house and hopefully the Senate
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
be better to put in a bill to set up the
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
same kind of a commission that they have
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
from Vermont uh the the Vets the bands
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
with Vermont has the nine points in
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
their criteria and to have the
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
department of cultural and historic
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
Affairs be that body to vet those
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
different bands as you just heard we
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
took up we heard a bill on a con Article
 
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
5 convention next is my issued Marxism
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
be stopped from becoming a state of
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
religion and I just wonder if this is
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
the right venue for this bill to be
 
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
the right venue for this bill to be
heard

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it really depends on how much rights
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities the state wants to
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
bestow Vermont's process and again if
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
you I please please please if you are
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
sincere in your desire to learn and
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
understand which I believe you are read
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
that law review that I emailed you all
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
and if you need me to email it again
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to do that because it
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
discusses this you know some states give
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
the tribes a lot of Rights and
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities some do what this is
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
asking we acknowledge you have a
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
historic and cultural tie to the state
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
that it's proven in history and that you
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
you are here today
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
so and with that comes nothing we're not
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
asking for any money we're not asking
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
for anything else what we are asking for
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
is that department heads listen to us
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
right now when I call Fish and Game they
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
say New Hampshire doesn't recognize any
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
tribes and I say well I'm enrolled in
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
the nelhagen tribe which is recognized
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
by the state of Vermont and what the
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont has recognized you
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
cannot unrecognize that gets to that
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
that trigger under federal law that we
 
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:27.860 align:start position:0%
have a status so the federal law repres
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
recognizes three different statuses for
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
tribes federally recognized that's what
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
goes to casinos to land claims to all
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
those things State recognition gives
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
nothing for that
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
you also have been hearing in some of
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
your testimony that state recognition is
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
a step toward Federal recognition that
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
is not true and that's what I was in the
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
handouts I was saying is that if you
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
look at the code there's nothing in
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
there about State recognition if you
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
look at the state recognition there's
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in there about it leading too it
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
does say there are federally recognized
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
tribes that are also state recognized
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
those are just two equal facts they're
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
not steps that lead one to another then
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
I gave you testimony from a hearing in
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
2007 where Senator Dole specifically
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
asked the chairman groins
 
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.130 align:start position:0%
asked the chairman groins
um

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
about State recognition and did it help
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
with their the Lumbee tribes Federal
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
recognition and he said you know we've
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
been state recognized for 120 years
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Dole thank you for asking but uh
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
the Bia the federal government throws
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
that aside they don't even look at that
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
that does nothing to help us with
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
Federal recognition so if you pass this
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
resolution you make it as simple as you
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
want you take as little write some
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
historic and cultural contributions you
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
pass resolutions all the time and what
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from my colleagues is oh but
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's just fluff it means nothing what
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
it means is it flips that switch at the
 
01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:02.179 align:start position:0%
federal level to allow us to receive
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
limited funds funding to the state to
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
the Native Americans in the state
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
and it allows us to call fishing game
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
and say you know these permits we have
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
because we're state recognized Abenaki
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
to carry feathers can we sit down and
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
talk about that so we don't have
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings in the field and it
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
allows Fish and Game to get the
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that that saying New
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't recognize any Abenaki
 
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any harm in saying yes to
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
this and at the same time looking at how
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
do we provide a path for others and do
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
you want to give more rights and
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to Native Americans but
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
we have a path now and it's a path
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
available to every band
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
one follow-up Mr chair follow up thank
 
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.229 align:start position:0%
one follow-up Mr chair follow up thank
you

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
um my other concern is this is a house
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution yes and under
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
Center rule 3-23 I think it is they do
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
not accept house resolutions per se
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
it goes through the process of uh being
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
a late filing it is a uh a two-thirds
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
vote of the Senate to take that bill
 
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
into the chamber to even discuss it and
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's an awful High burden to
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
have 16 Senators that will agree to even
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
hear this knowing our Senate thank you
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative shurtle if you mentioned
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
that to me yesterday and last night I
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to talk to one of
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors of the bill Senator
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
David Waters and um so this it does take
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds vote for any res resolution
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution many of them go to
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate many of them are accepted uh
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
this committee has the work to do of
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
this committee and what the Senate
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
chooses to do is what they'll choose to
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
do that would be the next step so I
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
really don't think that that's a
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
consideration that needs to weigh on
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
this committee no I mentioned that only
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
as a courtesy to you well thank you the
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
hurdle that you've got to get over thank
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
you um I I worked very hard on House
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 6 1610 for the commission on Native
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
Affairs I was basically the secretary
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
for representative Carr and I learned
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
what the sausage making
 
01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
analogy was all about his back was right
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you very much thank you
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious as to why only one band
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
was recognized and why not all bands of
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
Abernathy because of course I also being
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
a born in this state Granite stator am
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
aware there's more than just one band
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
that exists in the state and I guess
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
that was my first I'll be honest with
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
you reaction was why aren't all
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
Abernathy recognized
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think I've answered that but I'll try
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
to um clarify it again that um
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
in any form of recognition whether it's
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
Federal recognition or state recognition
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
each band applies like you don't bring
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
all the Abenaki into say the grand hall
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
and and dub them Abernathy it's not how
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
it works are all Native Americans so
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
each each band each tribe has their own
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
their own everything in their own
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
history their own membership roles their
 
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
own leadership and we're not bound
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
together by any Grand Council or
 
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.330 align:start position:0%
together by any Grand Council or
anything

01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
so each tribe applies for themselves and
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would hope you would see a lot more
 
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:30.020 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
recognition but nowhegan can only ask
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
for recognition for themselves so it
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
would not you would never see in Vermont
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
when they set up that very complex
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
process and I know representative
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
shirtle as he indicated has gone through
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
that and so is David Waters and in that
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
law review you'll see that it's one of
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
the most complicated or comprehensive
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
processes in the country
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
each tribe applied in their own right by
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
themselves it was not a group
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
application and and there's also been
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
some talk about how other tribes in
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
Vermont would get punished by the
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
actions of nelhegan same thing holds
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
true there's no group punishment and in
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
fact uh Chief Stevens will probably talk
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
to that one concern that was raised but
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're all individual tribes each tribe
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
applies in their own name and both as a
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
member of the tribe and as the
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative asked to submit this on
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
behalf of the nohigan tribe that's what
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
I've done I would certainly submit a
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
bill for any other tribe that asked and
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
anything else represent Finney
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you spoke earlier about this bill
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
isn't asking for any funding but you but
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
you did say that if if you know excuse
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
me if we were to pass it it would
 
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
me if we were to pass it it would
trigger

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
um Federal
 
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
um funding uh
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
mechanisms can you speak to how much
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
money went to Vermont or how much money
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
would come to New Hampshire if this was
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
I could not give those exact details I
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
Know Chief Stevens will be able to speak
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
to what that means in terms of
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
triggering the ability to apply for
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
funding I know that in Vermont they're
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of things I don't try to
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
become an expert in Vermont law or or
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
funding sources but I do know that as
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
outlined in the National Conference of
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
State legislatures thing on State uh
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
recognition those agencies are
 
01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:31.390 align:start position:0%
recognition those agencies are
um

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
are allowed under law under federal law
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
to allocate money and whether that money
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
is going to go into the state treasury
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
or not I think Chief Stevens will be
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you for your
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
introduction of this measure and
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
pointing out also that there is a portal
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
that uh folks have already been to Great
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
extent and effect uh submitting some
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
perspectives and information and I would
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
invite you uh we'll exec this in a week
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we have some time to process the
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
information that we're getting and I
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh Chris Dyer again for
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%

01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
invite you to uh respond to the
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure how long you can
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
stay today but if you want to respond to
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
some points that are brought up later as
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor I will I invite you to
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
do that okay and I can stay as late as
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
you want I
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
um how how and when would you want me to
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
do that chairman
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's a little bit open-ended and it
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
brings me to the other point I wanted to
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
make representative Belcher is in the
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
house correct yes so he is the sponsor
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
of uh HR 15. I want to just explain
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
something real quick in terms of our
 
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
something real quick in terms of our
scheduling

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
um our rules are sets that we can we
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
list the measures that we're going to
 
01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.450 align:start position:0%
list the measures that we're going to
hear

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
and we cannot start early
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
so and I'm sure you understand this but
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
just so everybody else understands and I
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
want to alert representative Belcher
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
that I have nine pink cards here and I
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
we all very much look forward to hearing
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the folks who took the
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
time to come in especially today so
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be a while before you get to HR
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
15. I know you're in another committee
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
so it'll be at least uh 11 o'clock or
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
later just FYI
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh we so we can't start early we can run
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
late we'll run as late as we need to
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
because we appreciate and honor uh you
 
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
folks taking the time to come in here
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we'll schedule a hearing
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
and it'll be introduced in two two or
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
three minutes and there's no one else to
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
testify and then we have to sit here
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
um until for it varies for however long
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
until the next one can start so that's a
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
time management thing that we're doing
 
01:19:50.689 --> 01:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
so just you understand that uh if you're
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
here for HR 15 or the subsequent
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
measures uh we'll get to them but they
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
won't happen
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%

unfortunately the State House Portal had
 
01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:42.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of glitches
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of testimony was uh
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
reported back that it was uh that this
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony was closed earlier
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
this week which meant that a lot of
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
people ended up
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
forwarding documents to us which we
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
are giving to you now
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
um this was an unfortunate situation
 
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
um this was an unfortunate situation
obviously

01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.729 align:start position:0%

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:09.050 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%

we have our own testimony
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
and a testimony of quite a few other
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%

sorry hcr7
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
as an extremely damaging Bill to the

indigenous community at Large
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
we agree a recognition process should be
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
established in the state however this is
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
not the way to do it
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to really recognize the
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
abnaki of the state as you know there
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
are multiple tribes and show a
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognition process should be
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
established not make resolutions to
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
establish tribes without any vetting of
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
what's stated within those resolutions
 
01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
as your tribe of record that is uh
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
petition the federal government for
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment we petition the federal
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
government in 1995
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's recorded in the Federal Register uh
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
of that time period
 
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
of that time period
um

01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
the federal standard to be accepted is
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh widely considered the gold standard
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
to to acknowledge and recognize tribes
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
it includes
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
massive amounts of comprehensive
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
historical documentation genealogical
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
this is what it calls this is what a
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
genealogy looks like not just a random
 
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
thing from you know ancestry.com this is
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive history of the Penacook
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
abnaki people in here in New Hampshire
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is vetted resources in fact this
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
document has got almost a hundred vetted
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
historical narratives in it
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
this is anthropological evidence
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
this book was meant to to distort and
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
call it distorted descent indigenous
 
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.410 align:start position:0%
call it distorted descent indigenous
claims

01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that French people were making in Canada
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
that they were abnaki indigenous people
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
chapter one in this
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
is about our tribe chapter one
 
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:46.820 align:start position:0%
it very clearly states that out of a 900
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh sample 900 member sample they deemed
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
it 40 percent and more were a descendant
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
from indigenous women
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
now that may sound like something but in
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
Canada they were saying that only you
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
could only be descended from Chiefs or
 
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
could only be descended from Chiefs or
men

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
men
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why this narrative was created
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
the last chapter in here
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
describes the nohigans as a
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
as a Vermont legislatively created group
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
with no historical evidence whatsoever
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
our tribe has been working with the
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
Canadian abnaki for for decades and
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
decades I was elected chief of the
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
kawasak band of Pinnacle cabinet people
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
I've listened to
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Gould's testimony
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is just one of two that she's
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:40.669 align:start position:0%
this is just one of two that she's
proposed

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
these are very damaging in a lot of ways
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
we we say a resolution like this really
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be based on some kind of vetted
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
historical narrative
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
states that have done resolutions or
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
proclamations recognizing tribal groups
 
01:26:00.129 --> 01:26:00.139 align:start position:0%
like the Virginia tribes they had
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
well-documented history of these groups
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
like the nip muck in Massachusetts they
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
had a small patch of land in North
 
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:09.620 align:start position:0%
Grafton in the state of Massachusetts
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
recognized that they had a deep and long
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
as you read this bill
 
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
as you read this bill
resolution

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:20.990 align:start position:0%
resolution
um

01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
there's going to be things that are
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
going to relinquish the state
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over the right to recognize
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
a group
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
this complex process was put in place by
 
01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
the federal government for a purpose it
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't an arbitrary thing it was to keep
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing from happening
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
this resolution fails to meet any of
 
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
in 2011 the Vermont legislative process
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
that recognized the Mohegan ban
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
expressly stated
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
they could not be recognized in any of a
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
state Province or Nation
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
this is a very firm thing the federal
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
government has put into place on all the
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
recognition processes unless that tribe
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
had multi-state reservations like in the
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
southwest they said you had to have a
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
basis for where you came from
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
this law into this resolution
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
would actually invalidate that because
 
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
it says very clearly in the enabling
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislation from Vermont they cannot be
 
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
in any other state Province or Nation
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
furthermore the state of Vermont
 
01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.810 align:start position:0%
furthermore the state of Vermont
uh

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know all these things that she said
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
about not getting any additional
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
benefits that doesn't really apply
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
all they're trying to do is expand their
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
territory and expand their influence in
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
our state to gain grants and other
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
things this is a very one-sided thing
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is not lift up all of the abnaki in
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
this region
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
they already have direct access
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
through their own state agencies for all
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
these things that they've listed in in
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
they had two seats on a commission in
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
our state at one point and they resigned
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
in 2021.
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
representative Gould also submitted a
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
bill HB 390 the bill will currently
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
remove all appointed New Hampshire
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
commission members and replace them with
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
members who are completely controlled by
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
the Vermont tribal leaders
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
and we'll also remove all state
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
appointed seat by agencies that are
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
already on the commission and thereby
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
eliminating all oversight
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
while relinquishing the state's
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over the commission because
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont also set up that they had to
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
have at least 50 or or more so I say 51
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
percent of the tribal members have to be
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
from specific regions of Vermont because
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
they did divide the state up into
 
01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:04.310 align:start position:0%
they did divide the state up into
quadrants

01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
quadrants
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
the Mohicans were given uh Caledonia
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
Marlene Williams yeah counties and there
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
was a map that was created by the
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission of Native American Affairs to
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
keep the the group separated and they
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
would know where their territories were
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
well it seems like the Mohicans
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
basically threw out the two premises
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
that they had to have the membership in
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
the state that they had uh particular
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
territories that they had to live within
 
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
and and now the United States trying to
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
push this through while we say that
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a real need to recognize
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
indigenous people in the state this is
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
not the vehicle for it and they're going
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
about this the wrong way
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
when they started this narrative which
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
was very troubling
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
I tried
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
um back in the 1990s dealt with the what
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
we call this Phillips lease issue we
 
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.370 align:start position:0%
we call this Phillips lease issue we
actually

01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
we had constitutional Scholars and
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
attorneys show up at a tribal council
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and said should we should we be
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
pursuing this 1796 land lease or Grant
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
at the same time the odnaught tribe
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
which is a federally recognized tribe in
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
Canada was also looking at it because
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
after the war of 1812 there was a big
 
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
contentious issue about the lake Memphis
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
Magog area and this also spilled over
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
into our state politics when the Indian
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
stream Republic was established like in
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
the 1830s time period and Ox state had
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
to squash that because it was people
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make another Republic that was
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
outside the federal standards this lease
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
was looked at by Scholars and nobody and
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
I mean nobody can prove who this
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
Phillips was because at that time the
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
Canadian tribes which were the only
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
governance in place had no Chief named
 
01:30:53.159 --> 01:30:54.169 align:start position:0%
governance in place had no Chief named
Phillips

01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
they were trying to find this as well
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
because they felt they could make a land
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
claim that would have included Lake men
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
for Magog
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
it was proven by them they couldn't do
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
it and we couldn't do it but the
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
overriding question is
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
people ignore the fact that George
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
Washington put in place in 1790 the
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
non-intercourse ACT
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
which because it was called the
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
Intercourse sect it prohibited this kind
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
of activity so this is what I call
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
historical myth of leases this has no
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
bearings being put into a into a
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
document that's going to be part of our
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
state history if it gets approved this
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
is an outright fabrication okay I'm
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
gonna just jump in here real quick we've
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
got a lot of uh material that's been
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
passed out for us to process in addition
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
to everything that's on the portal and
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
we also have at least eight or nine
 
01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
other folks who want to testify so as
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
you wrap this up I I just want to ask
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
you to try to speak directly to the
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
resolution I love the history and we
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
need to focus on the this resolution and
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
why which you've done a good job I think
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
of explaining where you where your stand
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
on this but if if you could wrap this up
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
so we can stop move forward all right
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the the resolution would make you think
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
that they're not going after anything
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
but in Vermont they after they got
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
enabled they filed over 90 pieces of
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
special interest legislation they have
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
now gained exempt property for tribal
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
land free hunting and fishing licenses
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
and a whole bunch of things which have
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
physical responsibilities that this
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
state may also look at
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
they also got uh
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
a a federal earmark for 350 000 from
 
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
Bernie Sanders Senator sandis to create
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
a position that was going to develop
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
their abnaki culture tribes that have a
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
culture don't need to have somebody
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
develop it for them
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh furthermore
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
you know we've been here for decades
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
working with this legislature we've been
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
presenting ourself as the regional
 
01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.790 align:start position:0%
presenting ourself as the regional
people

01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh we've been lecturing at your churches
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
the historical societies your schools
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
and your town events
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
we really request that you look at this
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
really hard and fast because this is
 
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
going to relinquish a lot of State
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
sovereignty it's a slippery slope as
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
we'd say please itl this
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
quick recap
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
Vermont already gives their people the
 
01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
right to sell indigenous arts and crafts
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire recognition for that tribe
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
would not change that they can already
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
do it so um to put that as a necessary
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
need for State recognition is just
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
conjecture the
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Commission on Native
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
American Affairs has already established
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
where they did hold two seats on the
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
commission they resigned those two seats
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the commission gives them direct
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
access to State agencies and speaking as
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
a head female speaker of a tribe we
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
already have a relationship with state
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
and federal agencies and we don't have
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
state recognition so it is possible to
 
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
maintain those relationships without
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
State recognition
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
I also want to say that it's been it's
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
been discussed whether or not Sherry
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
Gould is abusing her position and
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
committing an Ethics violation as the
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house representative to
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
put forth two pieces of legislation that
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
directly benefit her her family and her
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
tribe in Vermont this issue should be
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
formally reviewed by the New Hampshire
 
01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you okay an Ethics
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh issue is a little is someone I know
 
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
you're tying this into the resolution
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
but we need to be careful about what
 
01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're saying here in terms of an Ethics
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
violation vis-a-vis the the substance of
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
the resolution so I I caution you about
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
that uh but uh please go ahead and
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
finish up
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
no I'm pretty much done
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day this process
 
01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
does not help all the Abenaki within the
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
state if you really want to help the
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
abnaki in the state you would establish
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
an actual recognition process and not go
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
one by one and cherry picking who you're
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
going to recognize and I we don't think
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
the resolution of this type is really
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the right venue for doing this uh this
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
historical narrative and trying to make
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
it into our state record it is the
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate right vetting is important
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
vetting this is very important okay
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
Denise referenced the commission uh what
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
just what commission did you refer to
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
the commission on Native American
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
Affairs the New Hampshire Commission on
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions uh
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative massamila question
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
um so am I correct in understanding that
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that you are opposed
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill is because you feel there's
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
not enough research regarding the Neil
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
Keegan ban correct
 
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:04.460 align:start position:0%
um we feel that the um the resolution
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
within its entire should be vetted and
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
well documented
 
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of claims that we as
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
a tribal organization who's been you
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
know on the federal you know application
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
list since the early 90s
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
um there are things that they've made
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
claims to that we just actually can't
 
01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
even prove and so if this is as a
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
resolution this will become a fact of a
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
basis of fact for the courts and so the
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
courts actually refer back to a lot of
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
these resolutions when they decide law
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
and so if we pass a resolution in the
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
state with questionable history and
 
01:36:43.209 --> 01:36:43.219 align:start position:0%
what's that going to do in the long term
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
so as a tribe we fight very strongly for
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
truth in history and this is another one
 
01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:52.580 align:start position:0%
of those situations
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that this is sort of a
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
land grab proposal when you start a
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
resolution out with a potentially
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
fictious land grant
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know why would you put that in
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
there if you weren't after
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
um some sort of uh land grab then you
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have put that in there at all
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
it would have been strictly about
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
recognizing your people as an active
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
tribal entity within this state instead
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
they started off with a um with a land
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
statement it's it's damaging in a lot of
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
respects because uh we it's never been
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
proven this whole thing so putting it in
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
is a state document that's going to be
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
recorded and for posterity that's
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
already been disproven right and I just
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
want the committee to keep aware that if
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
they pass this resolution it actually
 
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
violates the Vermont recognition process
 
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
by acknowled being acknowledged in
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
another state if Vermont revokes their
 
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
recognition and state because of this
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
resolution is New Hampshire ready to
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
pick up that fiscal burden
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
we should also point out the Norwegian
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
tribe was created by legislation this
 
01:38:08.770 --> 01:38:08.780 align:start position:0%
book covers New Hampshire
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
actually New Hampshire Penacook in
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
abnaki history there is not one not one
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
reference to nohegan ever ever in any
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
historic narrative and this goes back
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
with hundreds of cited you know cited
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
references there has never been one this
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
was a fabrication okay thank you are
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
there other questions or comments or not
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
comments or like looking for questions
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh one more no yes
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
represent Finney go ahead
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
um just uh one point of clarification
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
again please if you can
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
um there was a grant from Senator
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
Sanders in Vermont for the 350 000 if if
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
that state sovereignty was to be taken
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
away in Vermont uh you know we'd have to
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh to shoulder the burden of you know
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
the recognition of the tribe so then
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
would we then be made to uh be be
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible for that money that
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
that had had already been granted plus
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
plus whatever else would be granted to
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
the tribe I wouldn't know you would have
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
to talk to Bernie Sanders about that we
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't we're not really sure how that was
 
01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
done it was a 350 000 year mark it was
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
slated for some position in Vermont for
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
doing cultural development and was it a
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
federal bill it was a federal okay thank
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
you yeah it was to develop a culture
 
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other further questions
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay I want to thank you for your
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
testimony and for the material that you
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
organized I know that took quite a lot
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
of time so thank you for the time okay
 
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.600 align:start position:0%

here from Chief Dan Stevens
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
Chief Stevens is here welcome to state
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%

so uh again as I've said before if you
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
can avoid repeating anything that's
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
already been said that will help us to
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
move right along okay thank you
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you Mr chair and uh
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh first I'd like to thank you
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
as a disabled vet what you guys do for
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
veterans because uh that's important I
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
just want to at least say that because
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
this is the committee that works for
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
veterans so I just wanted to at least
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I was going to come up here and do uh
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
do a Spiel but I think I want to leave
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
more time to
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
um answer questions now I am Don Stevens
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
chief of the nohegan band of the kusak
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of the largest Abenaki tribes
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
codified in law in the United States so
 
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna here to disparage anybody
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here to uplift and I'm only going to
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
say the difference between us and others
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
who may testify is that we are actually
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
legally codified in law as an Abenaki
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
tribe so we don't need vetting
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh we don't need a process for someone
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
to tell us who we are we have already
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
gone through that processes as you know
 
01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:06.179 align:start position:0%
passing a bill in statute going through
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
the house and committees and the floor
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
and then the Senate and then being
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the attorney general and
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
then being signed by the governor if we
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
haven't been vetted by now I don't know
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
who uh who is because you understand
 
01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:20.540 align:start position:0%
that process so I won't go through that
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
in our recognition Bill we are tied to
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
the Phillips land grant which I think
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
Miss uh Gould has provided that that was
 
01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.609 align:start position:0%
Miss uh Gould has provided that that was
actually

01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:41:34.619 --> 01:41:36.169 align:start position:0%
actually
um

01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
um filed in New Hampshire and part of
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
the Phillips tribe and it goes across
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
the upper part of New Hampshire over
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
that Grant goes over to
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
umbagog so I'm not going to even get
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
into the legalities of what's a real
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
Grant or what isn't I mean that is in
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law already and that has
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
already been
 
01:41:58.199 --> 01:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
already been
um

01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh vetted so I'm not even going to get
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
into all that stuff so the reason why am
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
I here
 
01:42:04.739 --> 01:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
I here
uh

01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
I am the leader of our tribe who needs
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
to represent our people no matter where
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
they live and we have 400 citizens or
 
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
Plus in the state of New Hampshire so it
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
is my role in my job is to support the
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
citizens who live here and the families
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally and currently living in
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we are not
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
here to disparage anybody we are not
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
here to step on anybody to lift
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves up just like in the state of
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont I have been involved in the
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
political world and working I actually
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
helped with the recognition process I
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
was chair of the Vermont Commission on
 
01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs before we got
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
recognition appointed by Governor Jim
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
Douglas in 2006 so I'm pretty familiar
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the process and I also was Chief at
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
the time that we went through the
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
recognition process so any questions you
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
have around that is fine
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and we uh no no he even got
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
recognized in two thousand 11 along with
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
El Nu and then masiscoe were recognized
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
in 2012 along with the kawasak tribe as
 
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
miss school stated that each tribe
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
represents herself as a sovereign tribe
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
with their own leaders and in our own
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
history so the difference of why we're
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
asking you to to acknowledge us a we
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
have been vetted a we are we have a
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
historical and continued presence in the
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and we would we
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
want a seat at the table so whether you
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
recognize us outright or you acknowledge
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are codified in law as
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
an Abenaki tribe and protected under the
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
federal Indian arts and crafts act that
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
um we have a seat at the table because
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
currently we do not and when it comes to
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
funds I was involved with writing the
 
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
Congressional Grant with Bernie Sanders
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm the one who administers it so if
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
you have a question on the Congressional
 
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
Grant I'd be willing to answer that
 
01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
Grant I'd be willing to answer that
question

01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh and also uh when it comes to funds uh
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
the differences are this say you have a
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
USDA Grant and they give a pool of money
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
for food to say they they Dole that out
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
based on state not by tribes so like if
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
I have a I have a grant through Vermont
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
to feed our people but it's only
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
restricted to Vermont I can't use those
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
funds in New Hampshire because that's a
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
different pool of money
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
because the USDA gives a pool of money
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to dull out it's so
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
even though we don't recognize European
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
borders the federal government and the
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
states do so these things we have a food
 
01:44:42.649 --> 01:44:42.659 align:start position:0%
shelf in uh Kentucky that helps feed our
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
people down here so we have to get other
 
01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
people down here so we have to get other
donations

01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
donations
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
um outside of those federal grants to
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
actually get money or food to like USDA
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
Commodities or other things to feed our
 
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
people so my role is to not to take over
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's just to be a player
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
and to be able to help our people as
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
much as I can because they're my
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
constituents and they're my they're my
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
citizens and that's what my job is and
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
what I do do not affect
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
um you know the Penacook or or the
 
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
pulios if they decide that they want to
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
go for recognition and have a
 
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
relationship with you that's their
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
business that's their choice I don't
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
care what they do I care what we do I
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
care what noelhegan does and I am asking
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
for a relationship with the state of New
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and or order so I may
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
represent our people and our people are
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
being able to be um
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be uh included as an indigenous
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and yes did we
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
have people on the commission yes but
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
the commission became toxic so both of
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
our citizens resigned from the
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
commission because we weren't being
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
represented and they decided they had to
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
step off for their own health and
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
well-being because that's why one of the
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
bills are coming up to deal with a
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
commission because we had somebody apply
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
to get back on the commission and that
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
was denied
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm saying is so we we couldn't go
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
that Avenue for representation so I will
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
stop there and let you ask questions of
 
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.950 align:start position:0%
stop there and let you ask questions of
me

01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
um because I'm very familiar with the
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
recognition process what it does and
 
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't do and also with any grants that
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
may come or not be
 
01:46:20.890 --> 01:46:20.900 align:start position:0%
come so I I've been around for a while
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh Russell Finney
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for acknowledging that so I'm
 
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
asking for us in New Hampshire would you
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
then be applying for a grant in New
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the same way that you got
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
one in Vermont
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily the earmark that I
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
got I work with a lot of legislative
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
delegations Patrick Leahy is Bernie
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
Sanders of course Pat Lee he's left now
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um we applied for a grant for cultural
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
purposes now do we know our history yeah
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
but it's all over the place so we have
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
to gather that up so it's a resource for
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
education for children as a as a
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
resource for many you know Scholars
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
other people who want to look at
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
different parts of History this
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
Congressional Grant was given so we
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
could gather those things so we could
 
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
have someone do that so it doesn't
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
matter if they live in New Hampshire or
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
Vermont or whatever it's for the
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
norwegan tribe in order to do what they
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
need to capture their their culture and
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
gather it from various resources like we
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
said there are many tribes throughout um
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
throughout historically through out New
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mass and Maine and and trying
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
to gather all those informations and
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
working with other people to get the
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
information that's the goal of it it's
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's we know our culture but we have to
 
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
gather it for resources and that's what
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
this Congressional Grant is and it's
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
backed up by the National Archives so
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
um this is not an easy feat to do so
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
could we apply we'd have to go through
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire congressionals they'd
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
have to decide but that isn't our our
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
goal right our goal isn't to all of a
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
sudden try to take over the world our
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
goal is to help our people and if it
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
helps the people and uplift the citizens
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire at the same time what's
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
why is that bad right I mean why is that
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
bad if we uplift people and we have a
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
specific relationship to you and it
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's up to the other people to
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
decide what relationship they might have
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
with you you don't have to tear somebody
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
down to lift somebody else up right I
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
mean there's room enough for everybody
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
here okay other questions uh for the
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes I'm gonna allow that because I
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
specifically invited you to do so
 
01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:39.020 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you I just want to clarify
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
what happened was Bernie Sanders got a
 
01:48:43.629 --> 01:48:43.639 align:start position:0%
line item in the federal budget
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
appropriating 350 000 to the department
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
the National Archives uh the national
 
01:48:54.410 --> 01:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
naira Don then had to fill out the
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork to State how that money was
 
01:48:58.729 --> 01:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
going to be spent to gather cultural
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
materials so he's gathered he can't buy
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
physical items this is all about
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
photographing 3D scanners going around
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
to museums it's not paying for any
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
positions it doesn't pay for salaries it
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
would not create any financial burden if
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
it goes away
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't create any financial
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
burden for New Hampshire and could you
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
explain the going away from Vermont well
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
I just that question needs to come from
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
the committee does anybody want to ask
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay we we need to move along if there
 
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
are no other questions Chief thank you
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh did I say end up
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh representing I I am curious about
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
this so they were okay earlier okay
 
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:42.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair okay
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
and you're welcome to answer just
 
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
understand that any a lot of these
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
grants Congressional grants are
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
reimbursement models you have to spend
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
the money and then get reimbursed so
 
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
even if something happened there would
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
be no more reimbursement because you
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be spending any money so I just
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that they don't just
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
hand you Congress doesn't just hand you
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
350 000 and say have fun you have to
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
spend the money you request it to be
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the by the uh sponsor of
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
the Congressional Grant and then they
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
with receipts and then they reimburse
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
you so I just want to be clear that
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
um this is to document our our history
 
01:50:21.129 --> 01:50:21.139 align:start position:0%
and our culture and there is no position
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
to actually do that I I use my salary in
 
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
kind to put towards gathering this
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
information and having other people do
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
the work so it's not a position like in
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
the tribe it's just part of the well you
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
know how Congressional earmarks work I
 
01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:38.940 align:start position:0%

the state of New Hampshire being

celebrated as I see it the state must do
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
for our own people first before
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
considering others
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
the state needs to formally establish
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for the tribe within our
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
state borders to be formally recognized
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
one such requirement must be that the
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
tribe resides in the state of New
 
01:55:43.739 --> 01:55:45.310 align:start position:0%

Native American culture within the state
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%

up that bother me one is the land grant
 
01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
and the legal ramifications of that that
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
is extremely disturbing
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
um you know if it sets a precedent for
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
our people or for the government because
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
even though my father's people are
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
um vetting for ourselves we cannot rely
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
on another state to vet
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
our people
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
it is it's too important and it's it's
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
establishment of integrity
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
of the state to to uh have a vetting
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
process of ours of Our Own
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
we really do need to have a a system in
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
place for recognition because we are not
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
dealing with senators or politicians
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with men who were
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
archivists or Farmers or
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
you know School teachers
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
managers they're not going to understand
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
this they're going to look at this
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
ratification and be insulted they're
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
going to think that
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
our priorities are not with New
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that is something you
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
really need to think about as your
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
constituents what are they going to
 
01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:03.169 align:start position:0%
constituents what are they going to
think

01:58:03.169 --> 01:58:03.179 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
what are they feeling because they are
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
the people that you work for
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think that setting up a committee or
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
a commission whatever we call that
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
um would be beneficial for everybody
 
01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
because then the mo the the Vermont
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
tribe wants recognition here they would
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
have to follow the same steps as
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
and be vetted just like everybody else
 
01:58:38.209 --> 01:58:38.219 align:start position:0%
it would be a sign of cohesion and of
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
of order
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
that is needed in this process
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay because it's just this way it just
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
seems very backhanded and and it's not
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's not nice
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's just not a nice way to go about it
 
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
I thank you and uh
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
for listening
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you share questions for this uh
 
01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank you share questions for this uh
representative

01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
testifying uh you know this committee
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
has three options we can vote it up uh
 
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
we can vote it down but we have a third
 
01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:18.179 align:start position:0%
option to retain the bill
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
would you support the idea of this
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee retain the bill in using that
 
01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
as a basis for setting up a commission
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
using the Vermont uh indigenous peoples
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
commission to be the boilerplate for
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
what we would do here as an improvement
 
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
in what we have now I would support it
 
01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:39.659 align:start position:0%
but I would not
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
um blindly state to use the Vermont
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
boilerplate system
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
um that is not
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know I question everything sure and
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would support that I would
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
like to be on it to be honest with you
 
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
but it has to be uniform and it has to
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
be the same for everyone you know
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
um we cannot rely on another State's
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
policies and I use the term boilerplate
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it's loose's Farm okay this is a
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
guide not to to take it per se yeah but
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you very much
 
02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much for your
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh next up I have uh in
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill fun
 
02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill fun
um

02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
find good death that's what I thought it
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
said from Romney I'm not going to ask
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
you this question while you're taking
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
your seat except I did I am wondering
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
how the indigenous folks
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
um stayed warm when it was 50 degrees
 
02:00:38.099 --> 02:00:39.290 align:start position:0%
um stayed warm when it was 50 degrees
below

02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
below
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
without electricity but that's that's a
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question thank you for being
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
here in opposition or in uh I'm sorry in
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
opposition to the Bill thank you so much
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
A lot of my points I was going to make
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
have been shared and I want to thank you
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
respect to state representatives for
 
02:00:56.570 --> 02:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
your service on this committee and thank
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
you honorable veterans who served I want
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
to give a little background about who I
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
am my mother and father served in the
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
military my father is a Vietnam veteran
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
and the current commander of the VFW in
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Post 4483 and commander of the
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
American Legion imposed 66 Plymouth New
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is on the board of
 
02:01:15.169 --> 02:01:15.179 align:start position:0%
directors of Camp resilience in Guilford
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am also a proud
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
descendant of the blackfeet nation that
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
is a federally recognized tribe and a
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident my mother served
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
in the Army and was an enrolled member
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
of the blackfeet tribe my father is
 
02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
indigenous blood as well I honor all of
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
you in them with great pride with my
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
strong background I am sharing my
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
opposition to hcr7 I'm concerned that
 
02:01:40.129 --> 02:01:40.139 align:start position:0%
this resolution of racist the kawasak
 
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
ban to the Penacook Abenaki there is
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
archaeological evidence for 12 800 years
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
in documented historical evidence since
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
the 1500s of them in this Terry of New
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parts of Maine Vermont and
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
even up to Canada they are the true
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
stewards of this land and in addition
 
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
there is no process in this state to get
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
recognition and I would suggest that we
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
make a formal process of recognition and
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
using New Hampshire formal process
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a strong State we're
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
capable of making a formal process
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
a key Point here is a resolution is not
 
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
a law
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
some of the language in this resolution
 
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
is applied to federally recognized law
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
not a state recognized tribe now
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
federally recognized is different than
 
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
state recognized tribes someone can say
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
that their state recognized but it does
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
not have and I'm not saying what this is
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
right or wrong it's just the way it is
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
so and then I listed other points and I
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to say that so as a descendant
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
and even if you were a member of a tribe
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
My Tribe the the tribe I'm a Descent of
 
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
is in Montana now there are still things
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have planned with my family in Montana
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
because people have passed away
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately now I still get
 
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
information from them I'm not losing my
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
whatever I have with that with the tribe
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
while being out here they simply send me
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
the information my rights are not lost
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
I also would not come here and say that
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
I you know would like to you know
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
buy tribes in Montana
 
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
my the my family is in Montana I
 
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a hard issue
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's an emotional issue and I understand
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
that but there is a process is strict
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
and it's it's rigorous to attain Federal
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
recognition and even State recognition
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's a federal there's there's a
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
there's a process at the state level
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
and so but that has to be vetted that
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
should be vetted we can I simply think
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
that we should honor the genealogical
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
history but that has to be vetted
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
someone who has to follow a strict
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
process with that for federal
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
recognition for example you have to send
 
02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.139 align:start position:0%
your birth certificate in you have to
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
have even your parents for certificates
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
and if you can go on and on and it's
 
02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:04.139 align:start position:0%
looked back for generations and
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
generations you have to prove who you
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
are I think in this state I think we
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to come up with a formal process to
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
make this happen now
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
I want to say I've sent you my emails I
 
02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
want to say something that's really
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
important the recognition of the four
 
02:04:23.169 --> 02:04:23.179 align:start position:0%
Vermont tribal communities per
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibited the recognition
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
they were recognized as a tribal group
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
in any
 
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
other state Province or Nation putting
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
forward a recognition bill or resolution
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
such as this one is a direct violation
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
of the Vermont recognition process and
 
02:04:39.169 --> 02:04:39.179 align:start position:0%
is strictly prohibited so in that sense
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
that would probably hurt the the league
 
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
and try and so I think moving forward
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
here they're saying that they're they're
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
not trying to take away anything from
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
the bands in New Hampshire but I feel
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
like it's saying two different things
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
the pro we have to honor and respect the
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
peoples that were here and in the
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
Vince furthermore I know that we've
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
already heard that the about the
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
commission and the seats and all that
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
but I want to say the state of
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
convention already has a New Hampshire
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
Commission on Native American Affairs
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
therefore I don't feel that we need to
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
refer to the state of Vermont
 
02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
for how to follow through with this
 
02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:21.169 align:start position:0%
for how to follow through with this
process

02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
and it is open to all indigenous
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
residents of an all tribal affiliations
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
that give acts direct access to numerous
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
state agencies I want to say the kawasak
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
band of the Pinnacle copenhacki has a
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
working relationship at the state level
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
of many different issues and has even
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
worked at the federal level
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
the Mohegan held two seats on this
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
commission until the records
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
resignations in 2021 the Mohican band
 
02:05:47.890 --> 02:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
members of the current New Hampshire
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
also submitted a bill Sherry gold state
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
represents the middle Bill HP 390 to
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
remove all current members of the
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire native commission
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
and replace them with members who are
 
02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.930 align:start position:0%
and replace them with members who are
completely

02:05:58.930 --> 02:05:58.940 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
controlled by the Vermont tribal leaders
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that that is just
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
if they're saying that they're not
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
um push out the kawasak ban to the
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
pentecoke panda Abernathy or other bands
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
in this state than I I don't understand
 
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
why that would happen and that's another
 
02:06:18.169 --> 02:06:18.179 align:start position:0%
bill that's being put forth and I oppose
 
02:06:18.179 --> 02:06:20.030 align:start position:0%
bill that's being put forth and I oppose
that

02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:20.570 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
the hips and it removes and you have to
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
stay assigned numbers and it's the
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
oversight of New Hampshire and it I I
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't agree with that
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
and state recognition absolutely does
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
help Federal recognition if you look up
 
02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Indian Affairs which this
 
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
is where it follows it has a strict
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
process and one of the steps that helps
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
it and you can read it you can look it
 
02:06:44.089 --> 02:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
up now if you like estate recognition
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
State recognition can be a part of that
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
in proving that you have a relationship
 
02:06:49.850 --> 02:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:51.169 align:start position:0%
with the state
so

02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
um so I think that I I would look
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill being itl'd I think it would
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for the state to work from
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
a state recognition process and people
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
have to be vetted to say who they are
 
02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
have to be vetted to say who they are
and

02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
and I am open to taking any other
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
questions I want to say I also have
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
experience I grew up in New Hampshire I
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
lived on a reservation not mine because
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a dormitory there so I went
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
and lived on the Navajo reservation and
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
I went there for a few years and I have
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
that experience of not only having land
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
with my family and experiencing that my
 
02:07:31.089 --> 02:07:31.099 align:start position:0%
families on many different
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
states and reservations we've spread out
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
we've inter mixed with other people but
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
having lived on the reservation too I
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
can speak to many issues with that
 
02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions please ask
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
me and I also gave you my phone number
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
and I know this is a hard and I have
 
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
compassion for people and I know this is
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
hard I know wanting to
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
get recognition is hard but I want to
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
also honor the process I want it to be
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
vetted and I want it to be truthful and
 
02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
vetted and I want it to be truthful and
fair

02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:08.780 align:start position:0%

for um taking my testimony uh my name is
 
02:09:10.729 --> 02:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
Sarah Smith I live in uh in Pembroke New
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also known as Suncook
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
um which was the name of the tribe that
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
originally lived there
 
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
I I come here as um
 
02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:26.300 align:start position:0%
as a member of the public but I'm also
 
02:09:30.050 --> 02:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh affiliated with the Quakers in New
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
England and
 
02:09:31.739 --> 02:09:32.390 align:start position:0%
England and
um

02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh I'm part of a group that helped put
 
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
out an apology to all the Native
 
02:09:41.089 --> 02:09:41.099 align:start position:0%
Americans throughout New England
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and this was a process that we went
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
through for about two years uh because
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh we wanted to do it right
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that we did was
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
look for all the tribes in New England
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and made it made ourselves our own
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
little database looking looking at
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
including at the the data that the um
 
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh State of New Hampshire provided
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
so because we wanted to make sure that
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
we we spoke to everyone
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
one of our basic principles is treating
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
everyone equally
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so I I come here with sort of a
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
moral argument are we are we treating
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
everyone equally here
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
um uh we in our process we made sure
 
02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:33.410 align:start position:0%
um uh we in our process we made sure
that

02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:35.530 --> 02:10:35.540 align:start position:0%
when we sent out the letter of apology
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know we spent a year making sure
 
02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
we were going to do it to the right
 
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
people and then made sure that we sent
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
it out at the same time so that
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
everybody would get it no one would be
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
treated differently
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
um and so I I urge you to follow that
 
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
principle of treating everybody equally
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
in this in this group the the
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
list that I have here are the people
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
that we identified as Abenaki and
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in Vermont and New Hampshire that we
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
could find
 
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
um actual groups of people represented
 
02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:14.270 align:start position:0%
um actual groups of people represented
um and

02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that's so those are the those are
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the names that we used and we we sent
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
the apology to those people
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I and I would urge you to
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
to again
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
listen to all of those voices one of the
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
things that I've learned is that
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh in studying this is that
 
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
the voices of the Native Americans are
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
key in understanding what needs to be
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
done and that when the Europeans have
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
imposed settlements without those voices
 
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
being heard that that uh the
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
consequences have not been good
 
02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:54.410 align:start position:0%
consequences have not been good
so

02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
um in this situation we really need to
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
sit down with all of those voices
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
together and come to Unity
 
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's another principle that Quakers
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
use and I I believe it's a Native
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
American principle too to come to Unity
 
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
before you act
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and I don't sense Unity here
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
I don't sense Unity within this and
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
within the different functions here and
 
02:12:21.649 --> 02:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
there needs to be there needs to be more
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
discussion before we act if we want to
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
come out with the right result
 
02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
um I I can just I could point you over
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
to Maine too we haven't talked about
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
Maine Maine is having a terrible Pride
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
right now because they came to a
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
settlement that wasn't fair
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
and it has unintended consequences 40
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
years later and they're trying to undo
 
02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:44.930 align:start position:0%
years later and they're trying to undo
it

02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:46.370 align:start position:0%
it
um and

02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
so this I just point that out to you
 
02:12:49.079 --> 02:12:51.470 align:start position:0%
so this I just point that out to you
because

02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
we might be looking at this moment but
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
we have to think
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
um farther ahead the Native Americans
 
02:13:00.169 --> 02:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
refer to this as
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
um Seven Generations ahead
 
02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:04.619 align:start position:0%
what what is what will be the
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
consequences if we act on this
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill right now
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
I put myself in in support of it because
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
I want to support the the voices that
 
02:13:16.729 --> 02:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
have raised it but I my support is based
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
on everybody being treated fairly and
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
equally here
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and so it's I it didn't have a place
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
to check that off and say but really are
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
you being fair to everyone so I would
 
02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
urge you to really look at this
 
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
um uh and I think I'm not sensing that
 
02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
kind of unity right now
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's sort of like well I like this
 
02:13:42.169 --> 02:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
idea but
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
I support it because I like the idea of
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
the recognition but I I feel like it's
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
not really there yet it's really not at
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
that process yet
 
02:13:50.579 --> 02:13:51.649 align:start position:0%
that process yet
so

02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my testimony
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and your
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony coming here from Pembroke uh
 
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
testimony coming here from Pembroke uh
questions

02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative massamila
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:04.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
when you sent out these letters you said
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
they were to recognize groups of
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
um Native Americans is that true and I
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
noticed that the null Higgins are here
 
02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
so how were they recognized I mean did
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
you do research as far as the legitimacy
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's also so yeah it's a we try
 
02:14:30.649 --> 02:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
to include people that really
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
not just that they had to have a
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
recognition but that they
 
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
self-identified in a strong way because
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that necessarily
 
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.129 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that necessarily
um

02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
the that European recognition defines
 
02:14:44.099 --> 02:14:45.290 align:start position:0%
the that European recognition defines
somebody

02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
that their recognition is also important
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
so so that the groups that Define
 
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
themselves within New Hampshire were
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
recognized too
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your your testimony
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and your time I have a card here from um
 
02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
minimum Baker from Hillsboro uh but it
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
just says that she wants two minutes to
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
speak to HR blank so uh I'm guessing
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
that you want to speak to hr7
 
02:15:22.129 --> 02:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
to this one yeah did I put the wrong
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
number uh there was no number so I just
 
02:15:25.609 --> 02:15:25.619 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you weren't here
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
to speak to uh 15 or 16 or and there is
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
an hr7 this this is HC our session uh
 
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
seven house concurrent resolution in
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
this thank you eventually we'll get to
 
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
HR 7. I'm not well versed on all the
 
02:15:41.569 --> 02:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to figure it out here
 
02:15:41.579 --> 02:15:43.129 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to figure it out here
too

02:15:43.129 --> 02:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm Marion Baker Baker from
 
02:15:45.659 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm Marion Baker Baker from
Hillsborough

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.109 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough
and

02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
when I looked in the room I realized
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're we recognize our mountains
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
we recognize our Rivers all of which
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
most of which have
 
02:16:01.209 --> 02:16:01.219 align:start position:0%
Abenaki names and for a long time
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
increasingly I've been feeling
 
02:16:06.169 --> 02:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
embarrassed that we're not recognizing
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
that there are Native Americans I'm not
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
sure the best way of doing it but we
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
need to recognize the Native Americans
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
amongst us of all that they have done
 
02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
for us and are continuing to do for us
 
02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:19.970 align:start position:0%
for us and are continuing to do for us
um

02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
and so I'm
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a Quaker as well and wanting to lift
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
up I really want to thank the the pulos
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
and all the work they have done through
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire in educating
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
us about a lot of the history and what's
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
going on among Native Americans and I
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank Sherry Gould and Daryl
 
02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:43.460 align:start position:0%
Peasley and others from the from the
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
Mohegan tribe that have also done a lot
 
02:16:49.370 --> 02:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
of education for a lot of us that who
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
always were told there were no Indians
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
in the state they all died off
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of smallpox or went West
 
02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:00.059 align:start position:0%
which has been proven is no no longer
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
true and by archaeological evidence
 
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:05.389 align:start position:0%
true and by archaeological evidence
um

02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
so I just hope that we can find a way
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
where we can recognize the
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
abenakis our neighbors
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm voting in for the for the
 
02:17:23.209 --> 02:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
bill because I would like to get the
 
02:17:25.969 --> 02:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
process started at least recognize One
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
Tribe hoping other tribes will follow as
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
well until all tribes are recognized
 
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
so I just want to encourage us to find
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
some way to recognize
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
our our neighbors
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%

will you take any questions if there are
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
any sure
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for this speaker
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
in singing and thank you
 
02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:56.219 align:start position:0%

02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
I have three more cards
 
02:17:58.740 --> 02:17:59.450 align:start position:0%
I have three more cards
um

02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
Catherine corkery is asked for two
 
02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:02.450 align:start position:0%
Catherine corkery is asked for two
minutes

02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:03.049 align:start position:0%

02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
Melinda Sim that's in opposition Melinda
 
02:18:07.849 --> 02:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
Sims has asked for three minutes in
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
opposition and Carlos
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
Carlos Cardona who's been here before is
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
in opposition he doesn't have a time of
 
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
requested minutes so those are the three
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
that we have left is Catherine here
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%

it's really great to see you all and I'm
 
02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
honored to speak to this committee my

name is Catherine corkery I represent
 
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sierra Club and
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
um there are about 17
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
000 of our members and supporters in the
 
02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:58.849 align:start position:0%
000 of our members and supporters in the
state

02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.859 --> 02:19:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Sierra Club asks for
 
02:19:06.849 --> 02:19:06.859 align:start position:0%
caution as you approach HCR 7.
 
02:19:06.859 --> 02:19:08.450 align:start position:0%
caution as you approach HCR 7.
and

02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
um Wrecking and we see that there are
 
02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh that actually Force us to oppose the
 
02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:17.629 align:start position:0%
uh that actually Force us to oppose the
bill

02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:19:20.450 --> 02:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
and one of the things
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
um is that this is a resolution
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
and a resolution is not law
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
and it in the bill
 
02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:30.410 align:start position:0%
and it in the bill
um

02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
let me back up recognition is really
 
02:19:34.439 --> 02:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
let me back up recognition is really
important

02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:19:39.250 --> 02:19:39.260 align:start position:0%
for our native Community
 
02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
either state or federal
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
it is a step for reconciliation
 
02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:47.530 align:start position:0%
it is a step for reconciliation
uh

02:19:47.530 --> 02:19:47.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
that had for Native communities that
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
have been subject to genocide violence
 
02:19:58.969 --> 02:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
victimization exploitation Erasure by
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
the culture society and the government
 
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
at Large
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
reconciliation is serious
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
and it is an important endeavor
 
02:20:13.310 --> 02:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
Federal recognition as we heard is a
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:20.210 align:start position:0%
it is
um

02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
it achieves not only recognition but
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
specific benefits
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that these two
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
desperate sovereignty processes are not
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily complementary or guaranteed
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
if you know if you have one you get the
 
02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:39.370 align:start position:0%
if you know if you have one you get the
other

02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:39.380 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
it is a serious Endeavor State
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
sovereignty processes are codified in
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
law and they have implications to
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
different state agencies
 
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
um a resolution
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
as noted by your member representative
 
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
shurtleff this house resolution is
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
really only for the house
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
the Senate can doesn't necessarily sign
 
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
off on it they can if they decide to but
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
also resolution is not signed by the
 
02:21:12.359 --> 02:21:13.370 align:start position:0%
also resolution is not signed by the
governor

02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
how is it actually recognition if the
 
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
governor the executive of the state
 
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't sign it
 
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
I I think this
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
um this is not recognition
 
02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
and it does not have the weight of law
 
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
and it cannot provide a pathway to
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
achieve as it states in the bill greater
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
autonomy and local Authority
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
it can't do that
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
so instead
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
and I think Mr shirtleff was reading my
 
02:21:49.439 --> 02:21:50.750 align:start position:0%
and I think Mr shirtleff was reading my
mind

02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
mind
um

02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're right I think you're right
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
um uh to
 
02:21:59.929 --> 02:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
uh full disclosure I live in his
 
02:21:59.939 --> 02:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
uh full disclosure I live in his
district

02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
pursuing a pathway for recognition is
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
really what we want here that there are
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
other States including our neighbors to
 
02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
the South uh and New York and and many
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
other states uh besides Vermont that
 
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
have gone through that do have state
 
02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
recognition recognition processes
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
we also have the relevant state agencies
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
that would be involved you certainly
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
would want their feedback the commission
 
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
as it's been already
 
02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:41.210 align:start position:0%
as it's been already
um

02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh noted and there are experts at
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and at UNH and at the other
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
universities in the in the State uh
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
Native American law is also a really
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
specialized and I think
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
um the state would the conversation
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
would benefit uh by having someone who
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
is an expert
 
02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and and not to pass this resolution
 
02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:12.500 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
but to to agree upon a goal to create a
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
pathway to recognize and and and have a
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
have a place to vet out to actually
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
categorize or or what was it the
 
02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
characterize different
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
um the different groups uh
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications timelines at the
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions uh and and what to tell
 
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
the state agencies how to interact with
 
02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
these none of that is provided in this
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill and and I just encourage the
 
02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:52.130 align:start position:0%
bill and and I just encourage the
committee

02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
to recognize the the seriousness of of
 
02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
recognition sorry saying that too much
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
um but to uh this is a series in Denver
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it has a lot of implications and it
 
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
is the right Pathway to take but this
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
may not be the right venue to take it so
 
02:24:17.929 --> 02:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
with that I will conclude
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions if there
 
02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.969 --> 02:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
we okay Shane and thank you for coming
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%

cards uh I mentioned Carlos is here he
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
did not he's in opposition to the bill
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
and then I have one final card uh at
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
from um
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
and it's gonna call Carlos but it looks
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
like you're on the way so uh have a seat
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a seat uh you asked for two minutes
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
and you're you're coming from Bedford
 
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
Center Road and for the record if you
 
02:25:04.849 --> 02:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
could just uh state your name
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
um in a better way than I did yes yes hi
 
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
um my name is Lev tafsamore
 
02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and bear with me I've never done this
 
02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:14.690 align:start position:0%
um and bear with me I've never done this
before

02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to everybody here
 
02:25:21.530 --> 02:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:25:26.809 --> 02:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
all my elders behind me have something
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
really important to say and I think I
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
can safely say I'm representing the
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
younger population of Abenaki indigenous
 
02:25:34.319 --> 02:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
younger population of Abenaki indigenous
people

02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and I just think that this bill is
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly important because
 
02:25:43.849 --> 02:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
it just it gives it's all inclusive and
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
it gives everybody that needs credit
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
credit and
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
I live in New Hampshire but I work also
 
02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
in California and I just think it's sort
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
of like
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
crazy how I can go out west and
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know my fellow native Community it's
 
02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:01.910 align:start position:0%
you know my fellow native Community it's
like

02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:26:04.610 --> 02:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
they're all people know who's who and
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's like you come out here and it's
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
like oh wait you're native it's like
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
I didn't know there were people like you
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
here well absolutely so I think this is
 
02:26:18.349 --> 02:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important bill to help
 
02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
everybody and be all inclusive and also
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's gonna it says something for
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
my elders behind me and having their
 
02:26:32.090 --> 02:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
voices heard and also says something for
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
us as young people like how am I going
 
02:26:35.929 --> 02:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
to be able to explain things to my kids
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be able to explain
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
things to their kids
 
02:26:42.889 --> 02:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
so I just hope and really ask people to
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
really really
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
listen to what the people are saying
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
because it's very valid and very
 
02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:49.309 align:start position:0%
because it's very valid and very
important

02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:26:52.490 --> 02:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you so much for stepping
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
up absolutely and speaking up would you
 
02:26:57.889 --> 02:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any are
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions uh representative
 
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
O'Neill yes thank you for taking my
 
02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:02.750 align:start position:0%
O'Neill yes thank you for taking my
question

02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for coming and speaking
 
02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
today I think one of the common themes
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
we've been been hearing from the
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
different groups is that everyone agrees
 
02:27:10.370 --> 02:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
that there should be some recognition
 
02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
but there's a little differing in terms
 
02:27:14.690 --> 02:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
of the mechanism for going about it with
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
some people speaking and talking about
 
02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
how a commission would be with a formal
 
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
process might be more appropriate can
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
you just share how you how you feel on
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.969 --> 02:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
I have to admit I'm so overwhelmed by
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
everything here I'm not quite sure how
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
to answer your question and I want to be
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
very transparent and like say to you I'm
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how to answer your
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
question from my own personal life I'm
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
adopted and I recently just found out
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
that my birth family was one of the
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
stolen families on the east coast and my
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
family has been misplaced
 
02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
how am I gonna explain that to my kids
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
how are other kids that are in my
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
situation or won't even have the luxury
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
of being in my situation gonna be able
 
02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
to find that out
 
02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I just feel like it's important that
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
everybody be all inclusive and
 
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
understand that everybody's life and
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
situation is different
 
02:28:13.849 --> 02:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
and I feel like having this bill
 
02:28:16.849 --> 02:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
is super important because it documents
 
02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
children like me
 
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.809 --> 02:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you again for for stepping up
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
and speaking out uh Belinda Sims has
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
some written testimony and had asked for
 
02:28:34.809 --> 02:28:34.819 align:start position:0%
three minutes in
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
Melissa Melinda
 
02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:43.309 align:start position:0%
Melissa Melinda
welcome

02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.330 --> 02:28:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:51.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't face all of you
 
02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:58.010 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't face all of you
um

02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
my name is Melinda Sims I'm from Belmont
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I come to you today as a
 
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
concerned constituent a disabled veteran
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
a member of the Kawasaki band of the
 
02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
Penacook Abenaki people and an
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
independent information researcher with
 
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
membership in The Association of
 
02:29:21.010 --> 02:29:21.020 align:start position:0%
Independent information professionals
 
02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
specializing in historical and
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
genealogical research in both the United
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
when I read HCR 7 it concerns me as
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
there are several discrepancies that
 
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
would not make this a simple bill
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
the following are the some of my
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
concerns no we've touched on a lot of
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
the the points but so I'll cut out some
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
of them but
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
um a couple I need to overlap
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
um the nelhegan ban has not appeared in
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
any documented indigenous historical
 
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
native prior narrative prior to 2004.
 
02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
therefore they would not have standing
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
in our state all of the historical data
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
that the tribal applicants claim need to
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
be substantiated by a professional and
 
02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
unbiased source and a historically
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
accurate manner
 
02:30:22.010 --> 02:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the Vermont act allows applicants to
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
self-declare which is concerning
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
Vermont's recognition act 107 is
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
deficient in its wording about the use
 
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
of a board certified genealogist to
 
02:30:35.929 --> 02:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
properly vet the tribal applicants
 
02:30:35.939 --> 02:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
properly vet the tribal applicants
genealogies

02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
genealogies
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
the ACT is also vague in requiring a
 
02:30:43.969 --> 02:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
need for unbiased third-party expert
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
veters that are not akin to the tribal
 
02:30:47.399 --> 02:30:48.889 align:start position:0%
veters that are not akin to the tribal
applicants

02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
we should not blindly accept Vermont's
 
02:30:54.650 --> 02:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
critically flawed tribal recognition
 
02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:56.270 align:start position:0%
critically flawed tribal recognition
process

02:30:56.270 --> 02:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
there should be a clear and impartial
 
02:31:00.849 --> 02:31:00.859 align:start position:0%
vetting process by an outside
 
02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
professional source for all historical
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
and genealogical data that is presented
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
by any tribal applicant
 
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
Vermont's recognition act 107 also
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits any tribe from being
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
recognized as a tribal group in any
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
other state Province or Nation putting
 
02:31:23.870 --> 02:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
forward a recognition bill or resolution
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
such as this one
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
is in direct violation of the Vermont
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
recognition process and is strictly
 
02:31:34.849 --> 02:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
prohibited so it's perplexing to me as
 
02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
to why this band would request
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
recognition in New Hampshire too
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont's recognition act 107 States it
 
02:31:45.889 --> 02:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
will assist the Native American Indian
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
tribes recognized by the state to secure
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
assistance for social services education
 
02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities so on and so
 
02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:55.490 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities so on and so
forth

02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should not be offering
 
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
benefits to outside tribal organizations
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
already recognized in another state if
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the band were to be recognized in New
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wouldn't that be double
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
dipping in benefits
 
02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
personally I'm flabbergasted that a bill
 
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
to recognized a Vermont band has come
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
before this legislature especially
 
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
knowing that there are bans right here
 
02:32:23.929 --> 02:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that have never been
 
02:32:23.939 --> 02:32:25.790 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that have never been
recognized

02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
I find this disrespectful to all our
 
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
indigenous New Hampshire cons
 
02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:31.670 align:start position:0%
indigenous New Hampshire cons
constituents

02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:32:33.889 --> 02:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
and if this should go forward I think it
 
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
would be shameful
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for hanging in there for a
 
02:32:43.210 --> 02:32:43.220 align:start position:0%
couple hours
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
and questions do you would you take any
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.770 --> 02:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
and seeing none
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh yeah yes uh
 
02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.730 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh yeah yes uh
representative

appreciated we've got a plenty to to go
 
02:33:15.889 --> 02:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
through on this on this measure
 
02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
final pink card is uh Carlos Cardona has
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
been here before
 
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
the issue on Puerto Rico we had a
 
02:33:27.710 --> 02:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on we'll be executing that this
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh Carlos but you're here for
 
02:33:33.889 --> 02:33:33.899 align:start position:0%

I am uh thank you uh chairperson and
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing me out once more
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
in this committee it's always great to
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
see you all
 
02:33:49.690 --> 02:33:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
I just said Thank you for having me
 
02:33:56.270 --> 02:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
today good day also I wanted to say my
 
02:33:58.370 --> 02:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
presence is my resistance my language is
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
my freedom thank you for allowing me to
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
my name is Carlos Enrique Cardona LeBron
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
I am a member of the higuayagua tribe
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
and I should acknowledge it's not an
 
02:34:10.010 --> 02:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
indigenous tribe to the state of New
 
02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as an indigenous tribe to the
 
02:34:16.250 --> 02:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
Caribbean part of the Taino family but I
 
02:34:19.490 --> 02:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
I should also note that there are 17 000
 
02:34:21.710 --> 02:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
boricuas tainos here in the state of New
 
02:34:23.929 --> 02:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire much larger than some other
 
02:34:25.969 --> 02:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
indigenous groups in the state so if
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to start a resolution by
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
acknowledging United States tribe
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should start by some of the
 
02:34:34.849 --> 02:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
larger tribes that exist here in the
 
02:34:34.859 --> 02:34:37.130 align:start position:0%
larger tribes that exist here in the
state

02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I also want to mention that I am a
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Commission
 
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
on Native American Affairs appointed by
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
Governor Chris sununu I also here have
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
written testimonies yesterday the
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
commission met we did not have a quorum
 
02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
due to some unforeseen events so we were
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
not able to vote on how we feel as a
 
02:34:58.849 --> 02:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
commission but it is safe to say that
 
02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
out of 12 members only nine of them are
 
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
voting members
 
02:35:06.170 --> 02:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
which nine testimonies opposing this
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
resolution including the chairperson of
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
the commission a new New Hampshire
 
02:35:13.130 --> 02:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
native American Affairs I should also
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
note that every single one of these
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
members has been appointed yes please
 
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh every single
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
one of these uh Commissioners members of
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
the commission on New Hampshire native
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
American Affairs has also been appointed
 
02:35:30.410 --> 02:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
by our current Governor Chris sununu
 
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh but of course I am here for myself as
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
a private citizen and I'm just
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
facilitating to provide you the
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
testimonies of my colleagues I am from
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
Laconia New Hampshire and I should know
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge the brothers and sisters
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
from the Kawasaki band who have been the
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
Guardians of many of our lands that we
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
live in today I am asking you today to
 
02:35:52.490 --> 02:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
please vote against the resolution I
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
truly believe that this resolution
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
discriminates against all other
 
02:35:57.889 --> 02:35:57.899 align:start position:0%
indigenous people living here in the
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I also have
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
concerns about this resolution not
 
02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
having the best interests of the State
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or the people that live
 
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
here as a young indigenous person I
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
would also like to see a proper form or
 
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
method in the state to recognizing
 
02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
tribes and Indigenous people but this is
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
not one of them this leaves out many
 
02:36:20.809 --> 02:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
cows it leaves many bands
 
02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
and tribes that we should be
 
02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:26.690 align:start position:0%
and tribes that we should be
acknowledging

02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
I believe in inclusion and this
 
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
resolution fails to do just that while
 
02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
allowing another state to dictate to us
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
who we should recognize and who should
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
be representing our indigenous people I
 
02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
also find it quite disturbing that a
 
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
state representative would use their
 
02:36:46.610 --> 02:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
power to sponsor a resolution while
 
02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
leaving out other indigenous people and
 
02:36:50.090 --> 02:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
only representing their personal
 
02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:51.950 align:start position:0%
only representing their personal
interest

02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you gracias jahon
 
02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:57.140 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
a question would you you said you would
 
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
take questions are there any questions
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative shortlist
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and it's so nice
 
02:37:08.450 --> 02:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
to have you back with us again
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you serve on the
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
commission would the commission be
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
offended if
 
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
if we retain this bill instead of us
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
doing something came out with the bill
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
to ask for a study commission to look at
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
this whole issue of recognition of
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
Native Americans in this state would
 
02:37:28.849 --> 02:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
that be offensive to the members of the
 
02:37:28.859 --> 02:37:29.809 align:start position:0%
that be offensive to the members of the
commission

02:37:29.809 --> 02:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
I have no authority to speak on behalf
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
of the commission but it would be
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
offensive to me and I think you can see
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
very clearly that other members that I'm
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
um would finally find it highly
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
offensive keep in mind this commission
 
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
is very diverse there are two tainos
 
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
there are two of pretty much every
 
02:37:50.270 --> 02:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
single tribe that resides here in the
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with the
 
02:37:52.849 --> 02:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
exception of the tribe that is looking
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
to get recognition because they decided
 
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
before my time on the commission to
 
02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:00.380 align:start position:0%
resign that I believe that was in 2021
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
so I believe that you know it would be
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
very highly offensive to myself and
 
02:38:07.610 --> 02:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
other people that uh believed in
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing uh tribes that are from here
 
02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire
 
02:38:16.969 --> 02:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
then who or whom should be the ones to
 
02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:22.849 align:start position:0%
then who or whom should be the ones to
formulate

02:38:22.849 --> 02:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
formulate
 
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
a commission to be able to vet Native
 
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
Americans it seems like this has been
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
going on for some time and there's a lot
 
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
of confusion a lot of different players
 
02:38:35.210 --> 02:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
and everything else but who should bring
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
everybody together to come up with
 
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
something uh that we can all be proud of
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
and give the recognition to a New
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Native Americans that they
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
deserve and they if who
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
I I love this question and I appreciate
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
it I do want to give you some context
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
and uh this past fall Governor Chris
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
tanunu made a proclamation recognizing
 
02:38:58.730 --> 02:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
Abenaki people's day
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
um including basically all Abenaki
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
which I thought was very inclusive
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
um I have a little bit of a problem
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
about presentation but that's between me
 
02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the governor that's a whole
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
different question
 
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but he also recognized the New
 
02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native American commission
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
which is also appointed by him and I
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that is a step forward I also
 
02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
believe that this commission should have
 
02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
more ability and more say and more power
 
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
in this process and perhaps the State
 
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
House can have instead of this
 
02:39:28.969 --> 02:39:28.979 align:start position:0%
resolution that has no teeth and causes
 
02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
more problems and headaches then it
 
02:39:32.330 --> 02:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
actually resolves or create any Unity
 
02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
amongst people I believe that the state
 
02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
house could easily fix this by giving
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
some teeth to the commission the
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission is already there why reinvent
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the wheel and it took a long time for
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
this commission to get recognition
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
Denise and Paul had worked very hard
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
amongst other their members for many
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
years to get this recognized so it is a
 
02:39:54.530 --> 02:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
step forward the mechanism is there we
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
just have to give it some teeth perhaps
 
02:39:58.429 --> 02:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
there's a law that we can pass where it
 
02:39:59.929 --> 02:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
gives some legal recognition to this
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
commission too because right now it's
 
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
just an Advisory Board essentially to
 
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
so my thoughts are this is something
 
02:40:09.130 --> 02:40:09.140 align:start position:0%
that very much the State House can fix
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
but this is not the way to do it by
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
starting with one group that really is
 
02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
from another state yeah and that wasn't
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
my issue it was the Native American
 
02:40:21.050 --> 02:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
people as a whole without one particular
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I also believe that you know this
 
02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:24.530 align:start position:0%
and I also believe that you know this
Commission

02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the easy solution so that
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
one tribe doesn't have more power over
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
another it's making a crystal clear that
 
02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
only two members of each tribe could uh
 
02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
could be part of this commission I
 
02:40:37.010 --> 02:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
believe that there could be a future
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill that it's in the in its way to you
 
02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
all which it would completely wipe
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the commission as it stands today the
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
commission is I have to tell you from my
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
experience I'm the youngest by 40 years
 
02:40:50.809 --> 02:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm the only one probably in their
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
30s in that commission it's very
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
respectful I think that it the
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
representation that we got earlier about
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
being toxic I find it offensive I've
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
learned a lot from these individuals and
 
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
the respect that they have for me which
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
my tribe is not even native to the state
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it has been profound
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and touching and my people experience
 
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
paper genocide so I believe that the
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
process is there to recognize one
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
another the commission works very
 
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
efficiently even with having no teeth so
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
I believe that you know you guys have a
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
good path forward this resolution is
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
just not one of them well maybe we can
 
02:41:26.929 --> 02:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
truck more offline I am happy to launch
 
02:41:26.939 --> 02:41:28.130 align:start position:0%
truck more offline I am happy to launch
anytime

02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
02:41:31.849 --> 02:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
I'll even buy thank you other questions
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh website
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was just wondering do you see
 
02:41:40.250 --> 02:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
if there is a particular con conflict of
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
interest with this particular piece of
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
 
02:41:44.399 --> 02:41:45.469 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
sieber

02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
sieber
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah I do believe that there is a
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest I mean I believe
 
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
that representative Finney was on to it
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
earlier within regards to my one of my
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
favorite Senators Senator Bernie Sanders
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and his ear Mark
 
02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
um you know this is something that
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
happens a lot in individual states I
 
02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that and what kind
 
02:42:08.570 --> 02:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
of cost this resolution could have for
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
future Generations here in the state of
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as somebody who is
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
proud of making sure that our state
 
02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
fights for its own rights and having no
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
federal government infringement on our
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
rights I find it really troubling what
 
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
kind of implications this uh this
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
resolution could have for future it may
 
02:42:29.570 --> 02:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
not have any legal binding at the moment
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
but in the future it could be uzx
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
context to recognize one at tribe that
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
has very little record history and two
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it could hurt other tribes here in
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so perhaps a
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
better resolution with that it's more
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
inclusive that gives all the tribes here
 
02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh it's
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
best and And in regards to that I also
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
want to highlight this representative
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
that submitted this resolution has the
 
02:42:57.290 --> 02:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
same ability to include all the tribes
 
02:42:59.090 --> 02:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know not too long ago representative
 
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
Peter Schmidt did a resolution including
 
02:43:05.570 --> 02:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
my people of Puerto Rico she could have
 
02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
done the exact same thing he's not
 
02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rican he's white he's from here
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire and he
 
02:43:12.889 --> 02:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
included my people so there's no reason
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
why representative Sherry couldn't have
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
included even without the consent just
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
to recognize simply the other tribes
 
02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
that are here in the state of New
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I think any state
 
02:43:24.170 --> 02:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
representative can do that there's a lot
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
of conflicts with this resolution
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
I find it highly offensive are there any
 
02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being here I have
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
two more pink cars that have come this
 
02:43:35.819 --> 02:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
two more pink cars that have come this
way

02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:37.910 align:start position:0%
way
um

02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:40.130 --> 02:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
Rod Sims has asked for three minutes and
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
David peesley has asked for two minutes
 
02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
is Rod uh that must be rod and Rod is
 
02:43:48.050 --> 02:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
from nine Sargent Street I don't know
 
02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
what municipality that is Mr Sergeant
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
but you'll Mr Sims you'll tell us though
 
02:43:54.290 --> 02:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
right yeah I'm from Belmont New
 
02:43:57.170 --> 02:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm my uh my wife spoke
 
02:43:59.330 --> 02:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm her caretaker that's why I
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
showed up today but my wife and I have
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
been married for 12 years and when we
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
did our e-harmony thing she really
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
didn't speak about how vested she was in
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%

02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after I married her I found
 
02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
out that there's been a turmoil going on
 
02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
in this state for quite some time
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different bands that
 
02:44:22.730 --> 02:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
have never seemed to come together and
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
have a united front it kind of puts I'm
 
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
from Ohio and where I'm from in Ohio
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of neighborhood gangs and
 
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
even though we live in the same town
 
02:44:31.929 --> 02:44:31.939 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the head of that gang
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
and they could never come together and
 
02:44:36.170 --> 02:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
have a peaceful conversation about
 
02:44:37.969 --> 02:44:37.979 align:start position:0%
something that was always Division and I
 
02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
see that a lot here and as this
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
resolution is written I I oppose it I
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
think it actually brings in more uh
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
strife and controversy than what already
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
exists amongst tribes here and I I would
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
be for a committee or something formed
 
02:44:56.270 --> 02:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
that everybody could have representation
 
02:44:58.490 --> 02:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
on and everybody could come to an
 
02:45:00.410 --> 02:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
agreement on and hopefully get something
 
02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
done in New Hampshire that would help
 
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
unite the tribes and the different
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
peoples that are here because right now
 
02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
it just there's a lot of division a lot
 
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
of people are there's angst and instead
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
of uniting they're they're kind of like
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to each other and I definitely
 
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
before if if something could be started
 
02:45:20.809 --> 02:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
to where some committee could be formed
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
and there's been some people that's far
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
more educated on this than I am talking
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
about this but I'm like a Outsider just
 
02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
seeing what's going on so I think I
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
think that people want something they're
 
02:45:32.929 --> 02:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
just not sure exactly how to go about it
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
and how to make it fair for everybody
 
02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:35.389 align:start position:0%
and how to make it fair for everybody
here

02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%

02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
little bit to what representative
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%

going to be upset that's native politics
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
for you
 
02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
for you

02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
I am the registered state agent for
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
Abenaki helping Abenaki
 
02:46:38.570 --> 02:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
through our tribal nonprofit I'm also a
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
melhegan citizen
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
so our mission is to help everyone
 
02:46:48.830 --> 02:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
this resolution was supposed to be a
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
stepping stone for others
 
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
and as soon as I started seeing all the
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
different stuff on your portal here we
 
02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:57.830 align:start position:0%
different stuff on your portal here we
go

02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:46:59.809 --> 02:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
it's going to be us against them and
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way they're going to portray
 
02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:02.270 align:start position:0%
that's the way they're going to portray
it

02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:04.429 align:start position:0%
it
2010

02:47:04.429 --> 02:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
2010
 
02:47:06.490 --> 02:47:06.500 align:start position:0%
working on the bill to get that the
 
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
commission and Native American Affairs
 
02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:10.670 align:start position:0%
commission and Native American Affairs
established

02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:47:13.010 --> 02:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
then I became one of the original
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
members I served two terms the last term
 
02:47:19.250 --> 02:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
was the vice chair
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
been off the commission for a long time
 
02:47:23.389 --> 02:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
I decided
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
it was time to get back on the
 
02:47:27.650 --> 02:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
commission to represent my people they
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
had four or five vacancies so I asked
 
02:47:31.849 --> 02:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
the question online on their Facebook
 
02:47:34.429 --> 02:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
page and I can still go back and get it
 
02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
if you pull it up to date it was a year
 
02:47:38.929 --> 02:47:38.939 align:start position:0%
later before I got a response from
 
02:47:38.939 --> 02:47:40.070 align:start position:0%
later before I got a response from
anybody

02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
and then the response was you already
 
02:47:44.570 --> 02:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
served your two terms so I contacted the
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they said that commission's like any
 
02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
other commission as long as you're off
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
for a full term you can reapply
 
02:47:56.929 --> 02:47:56.939 align:start position:0%
so that's I did
 
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
and I was not gonna count out anything
 
02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
they wanted me to do
 
02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:11.150 align:start position:0%
they wanted me to do
um

02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
pretty ugly
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
I was I was when people asked why I
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't back on the commission
 
02:48:19.490 --> 02:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
one of the commission members who was
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
still a commission member told everyone
 
02:48:23.630 --> 02:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
that I was under investigation
 
02:48:26.210 --> 02:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
for lying the governor's office was
 
02:48:28.429 --> 02:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
investigating me well anyone that knows
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything knows the governor's office
 
02:48:31.130 --> 02:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't investigate anything the
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office investigates
 
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
I inquired I filed the 91a request there
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
is no such investigation
 
02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
so and then it the rumor was going
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
around that well Daryl didn't get put
 
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
back on the commission because the
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
governor didn't want him on there
 
02:48:53.090 --> 02:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
because he was found out he was lying he
 
02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
so contact the governor's office didn't
 
02:49:00.889 --> 02:49:00.899 align:start position:0%
get a response because it's just Betty
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
and it and to me it sounds very Petty
 
02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
very childish I wanted to know why
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
someone's saying something about me I
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
even hired an attorney
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um almost came that close
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
so anyways I contacted the director of
 
02:49:18.410 --> 02:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
cultural natural resources
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
he was only honest one that I came
 
02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:21.710 align:start position:0%
he was only honest one that I came
across

02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
um my application I've went to the
 
02:49:25.130 --> 02:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
governor's office because the commission
 
02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
members didn't want me on the commission
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
and to this day I've never gotten a
 
02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
response back from them as to we're not
 
02:49:36.050 --> 02:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to entertain your application this
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
is the reason why so on and so forth
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
the reason the other two nohegan people
 
02:49:43.969 --> 02:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
got off the commission is because it was
 
02:49:47.090 --> 02:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
starting to affect their Mental Health
 
02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
starting to affect their Mental Health
um

02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:50.210 --> 02:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
it may not be that way now
 
02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
but it sure was
 
02:49:54.250 --> 02:49:54.260 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
there were there were many vacancies on
 
02:49:59.210 --> 02:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
and just recently the governor started
 
02:50:03.170 --> 02:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
applying uh appointing quite a few
 
02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:04.070 align:start position:0%
applying uh appointing quite a few
people

02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:05.150 align:start position:0%
people
but

02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
so anyways I don't want you to feel bad
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
that geez I'm trying to please Daryl I'm
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%

02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
never gonna happen
 
02:50:17.570 --> 02:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
I don't care how you do it I don't care
 
02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
if you give me a check for a thousand
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
dollars right now and I can disperse it
 
02:50:23.210 --> 02:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
they're still not going to be happy
 
02:50:25.969 --> 02:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
because they're getting recognition I'm
 
02:50:27.889 --> 02:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
not getting recognition it's oh my God
 
02:50:30.770 --> 02:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a chief and
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I hope you do your
 
02:50:37.370 --> 02:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
research a lot of research
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
because most of what has been testified
 
02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I I want to stay positive I don't
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
want to so anyways thank you if you have
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll be more than happy to
 
02:50:57.230 --> 02:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
I just couldn't sit by and
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's irritating are there any questions
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh Gagney
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:51:08.330 --> 02:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's actually it's uh
 
02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
more of a would you believe that
 
02:51:14.510 --> 02:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
what I've the testimony I've heard here
 
02:51:15.650 --> 02:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:51:17.809 --> 02:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
is like
 
02:51:21.889 --> 02:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
two close-knit families arguing
 
02:51:25.370 --> 02:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
over uh over whatever
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
and and you know that just bugs the heck
 
02:51:31.130 --> 02:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
out of me so bear with us I hope that we
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
can do a commission or something to get
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
down the bottom of this and settle it
 
02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes we will be
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
very much well or much better informed
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
by the time we exact this a week from
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
today uh we have a lot of new stuff
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
material here to look at and thank you
 
02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
for your candor it takes the pressure
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
off knowing that we're not going to make
 
02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:55.969 --> 02:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:51:58.670 --> 02:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none that is our last pink card
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
for this session which ran just a little
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
bit over the scheduled time but uh we
 
02:52:05.410 --> 02:52:05.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate the people coming in and
 
02:52:07.849 --> 02:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
helping us to get smarter and better
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
informed on this that obviously is
 
02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
important I like to ask the uh
 
02:52:14.330 --> 02:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
committees and dozens I want to we have
 
02:52:16.490 --> 02:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
three more measures that I I don't
 
02:52:19.010 --> 02:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
anticipate taking uh two and a half
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
hours each uh but you never know how
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
many pink cars will come in disruption
 
02:52:26.330 --> 02:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
of Belcher in the house
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
he is not
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%

02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
briefly and I'm going to go right to HR
 
02:52:58.250 --> 02:52:58.260 align:start position:0%

02:53:00.530 --> 02:53:00.540 align:start position:0%

give us another minute uh representative
 
02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.170 --> 02:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
now we've already recessed 15 we're
 
02:54:31.849 --> 02:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.450 --> 02:54:35.460 align:start position:0%

here and we recessed it to take H.R 16
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
so uh you have a little bit of time if
 
02:54:43.969 --> 02:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
you need it
 
02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
um we don't anticipate this will take as
 
02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
long as HCR 7.
 
02:54:52.250 --> 02:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
so uh that said at this time we'll
 
02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor or the
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HR 16 representative Gearhart
 
02:54:58.990 --> 02:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
from Merrimack County uh welcome
 
02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you
 
02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:02.870 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you
chairman

02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
02:55:06.769 --> 02:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
hearing this my name is Jason Gerhard
 
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
represent Northfield Franklin
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
and H.R 16 is very simple it poses three
 
02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
questions to the IRS which they have
 
02:55:18.530 --> 02:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
never satisfactorily answered and which
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
would put money into everybody's pocket
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the state that pays into that
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
fraudulent tax so I'm going to break it
 
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
down real fast to three questions
 
02:55:29.870 --> 02:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
where is the word income defined in the
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code that's the first
 
02:55:33.410 --> 02:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
one second where in the Internal Revenue
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
code is it written that the average
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
American who does not exercise a federal
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
privilege but simply trades their time
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
for money is liable to pay the federal
 
02:55:42.889 --> 02:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
income tax and lastly why have numerous
 
02:55:44.570 --> 02:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue Service Publications
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
directors and members of the United
 
02:55:48.530 --> 02:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
States Congress among others stated that
 
02:55:51.769 --> 02:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
the income tax is voluntary
 
02:55:51.779 --> 02:55:54.650 align:start position:0%
the income tax is voluntary
the

02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.929 --> 02:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
to really look into this
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
well this book is awesome but
 
02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
it's all based on terms of art or
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
specialized definitions of commonly used
 
02:56:06.650 --> 02:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
words inside the code so I'm just going
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
to go real fast just two of them maybe
 
02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
to go real fast just two of them maybe
three

02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
so first off Supreme Court quote U.S
 
02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
verse Ballard in 1976 quote the general
 
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
term income is not defined in the
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code
 
02:56:22.730 --> 02:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
now you guys don't have this I didn't
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
make up a whole paper but I'll email you
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
everything just so I'll give you all the
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
citations in an email so you don't have
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
to worry about that so now with the
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
definitions of the actual words
 
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
as I said before I've considered their
 
02:56:36.769 --> 02:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
term they're called terms of art we have
 
02:56:40.610 --> 02:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
in section 3401 definitions wages
 
02:56:43.849 --> 02:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
and employee so wages for purpose of
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
this chapter the term wages means all
 
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
remuneration other than fees paid to a
 
02:56:50.929 --> 02:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
public official for services performed
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
by an employee for his employer then we
 
02:56:56.330 --> 02:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
look now to see for employee for
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter the term
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
employee includes an officer employee or
 
02:57:02.450 --> 02:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
elected official United States a state
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
or any political subdivision thereof or
 
02:57:06.889 --> 02:57:06.899 align:start position:0%
the District of Columbia or any agency
 
02:57:08.929 --> 02:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
or instrumentality or anyone more of the
 
02:57:11.090 --> 02:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
foregoing the term employee also
 
02:57:12.889 --> 02:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
includes an officer of a corporation and
 
02:57:13.969 --> 02:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
then it goes into a whole bunch of stuff
 
02:57:16.250 --> 02:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
and it's not normal corporations but the
 
02:57:18.530 --> 02:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
point is it's all based off of this
 
02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
legalese maze work that no one
 
02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
understands so all I'm asking you to do
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
well to OTP this but to get this to the
 
02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
floor we pass it and we just asked some
 
02:57:32.690 --> 02:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
questions which I think we as
 
02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of this country are entitled
 
02:57:37.490 --> 02:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
to I mean the code is something like 66
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
or 70 I don't know it's thousands of
 
02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
pages long no one understands it so hey
 
02:57:43.490 --> 02:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
we'll just start with these three
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
questions get an understanding move on
 
02:57:46.490 --> 02:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
down the road and then we'll all be
 
02:57:47.450 --> 02:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
better off
 
02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the basic gist of where I
 
02:57:52.849 --> 02:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
wanted to go I mean we can look at
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
the definition of trade or business just
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
to show you how this is not
 
02:57:59.870 --> 02:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
um just relegated to those two words I
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to go on and on and on
 
02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to go on and on and on
so

02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:05.929 --> 02:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
this is another in section 7701
 
02:58:07.969 --> 02:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
Trader business the term Trader business
 
02:58:10.130 --> 02:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
includes the performance of the
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
functions of a public office and just so
 
02:58:14.690 --> 02:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know in the IRS code in in legalese
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
the word includes isn't like how we
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
think of it includes is only those items
 
02:58:24.050 --> 02:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
so it's not as in you know apples and
 
02:58:26.450 --> 02:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
oranges includes all fruit it's
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're simply those apples and oranges
 
02:58:30.110 --> 02:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
of what's being discussed I don't know
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
if that makes any sense I'm probably not
 
02:58:33.170 --> 02:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
doing a good job but first time kind of
 
02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
doing his life but it's just an it's
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's a very personal topic to me because
 
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's people doing multiple decades in
 
02:58:45.050 --> 02:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
prison for the supposed crime of not
 
02:58:47.690 --> 02:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
funding the war machine in DC via the
 
02:58:49.370 --> 02:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes which if you really
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
want to get into it none of the money
 
02:58:51.650 --> 02:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
from the federal income tax actually
 
02:58:53.330 --> 02:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
goes anywhere besides paying off the
 
02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
interest on a national debt which we can
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
never pay off so the whole thing is a
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
waste of time but the uh the issue at
 
02:59:01.370 --> 02:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
hand right now are these three questions
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I would appreciate actually just if
 
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I know this is
 
02:59:06.769 --> 02:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
all technicality stuff I really don't
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
want to get into that so much because if
 
02:59:13.090 --> 02:59:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:13.100 --> 02:59:14.929 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:59:14.929 --> 02:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:59:17.210 --> 02:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I'll do as best I can in the short
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
period of time we have so
 
02:59:21.769 --> 02:59:21.779 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh on line 11
 
02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's you state where in the Internal
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue code is it written that the
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
average American who does not exercise a
 
02:59:33.889 --> 02:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
federal privilege but simply trades in
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
their time for money is liable to pay
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
the federal income tax
 
02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it's not a matter of
 
02:59:43.969 --> 02:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
code it's the constitution in 1913 we
 
02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment that that uh made
 
02:59:51.889 --> 02:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
the personal income tax part of the
 
02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution isn't that where it comes
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
from not code but the Constitution
 
02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
got some highlighted passages for you
 
03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
right here don't worry so thank you
 
03:00:04.130 --> 03:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
chairman and two this is in PEC versus
 
03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
low the 16th Amendment although referred
 
03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
to an argument has no real bearing and
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
may be put out of view as pointed out in
 
03:00:12.050 --> 03:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
recent decisions it does not extend the
 
03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
taxing power to new or accepted subjects
 
03:00:15.530 --> 03:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
but middleware moves All Occasion which
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise might exist for an
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
importionment among the states of taxes
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
laid on income whether it's derived from
 
03:00:22.730 --> 03:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
One Source or another so what happened
 
03:00:24.889 --> 03:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
was let me read this other quote that
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
was a little bit it's prefers something
 
03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
previously the provision the provisions
 
03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
this is from uh hovering versus Edison
 
03:00:33.110 --> 03:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
Brothers the provisions of the 16th
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment conferred no new power of
 
03:00:36.410 --> 03:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
taxation but simply prohibited the
 
03:00:37.969 --> 03:00:37.979 align:start position:0%
complete and plenary power of income
 
03:00:39.889 --> 03:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
taxation possessed by Congress from the
 
03:00:41.570 --> 03:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
beginning from being taken out of the
 
03:00:43.250 --> 03:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
category of indirect taxation to which
 
03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
it inherently belonged so let me explain
 
03:00:47.090 --> 03:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
I know it's a whole bunch of mixes
 
03:00:48.650 --> 03:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
actually that's Stanton versus Baltic
 
03:00:49.969 --> 03:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
mining but
 
03:00:51.530 --> 03:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
what we have going on is the federal
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
government has two ways to tax us
 
03:00:57.889 --> 03:00:57.899 align:start position:0%
well let's say to tax the people of the
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
country right you have apportionment and
 
03:01:02.090 --> 03:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
then you have direct taxation direct
 
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
taxation occurs through excise taxes
 
03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:06.899 align:start position:0%
Alcohol Tobacco basically things you
 
03:01:09.530 --> 03:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't need right those can be taxed at
 
03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
the direct level apportionment has to do
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
with you New Hampshire owes the federal
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
government million dollars and there's a
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
million people here hypothetically
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
everybody is one dollar you can't say to
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
one person twenty percent five percent
 
03:01:23.929 --> 03:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
here's free money it just doesn't that's
 
03:01:25.490 --> 03:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional position the 16th
 
03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment didn't change any of that it
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
simply allowed the federal government to
 
03:01:32.570 --> 03:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
tax people who are deriving benefits
 
03:01:35.630 --> 03:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
from owning stocks in companies that
 
03:01:37.730 --> 03:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
dealt with the federal government so
 
03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
when I say exercise a federal privilege
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
that is basically if you sell guns to
 
03:01:44.210 --> 03:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
the military or something of that nature
 
03:01:46.849 --> 03:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
the simple trading of your time
 
03:01:49.130 --> 03:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
for someone else's money has nothing to
 
03:01:50.210 --> 03:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
do with the federal government if it was
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
it'd be slavery because let's think
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
about it I work an eight-hour day I'm on
 
03:01:56.450 --> 03:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
a 25 let's say uh income tax rate
 
03:01:58.610 --> 03:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
two hours of my day now we're going to
 
03:02:00.050 --> 03:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
agreed does it make sense so how is it
 
03:02:04.190 --> 03:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has a claim
 
03:02:06.410 --> 03:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
on 25 of my time or two hours of my
 
03:02:06.420 --> 03:02:07.370 align:start position:0%
on 25 of my time or two hours of my
labor

03:02:07.370 --> 03:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
labor
 
03:02:07.380 --> 03:02:08.450 align:start position:0%
labor
that's

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:02:11.090 --> 03:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
so I can be enslaved for 20 you know for
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
two hours a day
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's the issue
 
03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking you the questions but when
 
03:02:18.889 --> 03:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
you when you ask that question uh it's
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
in a rhetorical sense correct of course
 
03:02:24.050 --> 03:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just yeah I I'm not going to claim
 
03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
to be some expert I'm a carpenter all I
 
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
know is from I'm on more of a blue
 
03:02:30.110 --> 03:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
collar kick with this I just want to
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
know where in the code they're I'm sorry
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
yeah where in the code they're claiming
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
all of these rights to do this then we
 
03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
can have a further discussion I'm not
 
03:02:39.170 --> 03:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
claiming to be an expert all I know is
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
they've played a massive game of hide
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
and seek for way too long and I think
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's time to just get these basic
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
concepts out there I just I hate when we
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
get really caught up in the weeds of the
 
03:02:50.809 --> 03:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
legalese I think every person in this
 
03:02:52.130 --> 03:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
country should a understand the
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution Declaration of Independence
 
03:02:57.050 --> 03:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
end this supposed monstrosity that
 
03:02:59.210 --> 03:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
enslaves us to it for at least two hours
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
a day or whatever you want to call it
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
depending on where your tax rate is
 
03:03:06.429 --> 03:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate if you could get the
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
clerk a uh pink card for HIV so many
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
people in there I forgot thank you and
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh we would ask that
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the Indulgence of the
 
03:03:19.450 --> 03:03:19.460 align:start position:0%
committee the I'm gonna
 
03:03:21.650 --> 03:03:21.660 align:start position:0%

03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10 15 and it's now 12 15.
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your flexibility and
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and members
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee for for hearing my bill
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
and first let me offer some apologies
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
for submitting what's probably one of
 
03:04:03.230 --> 03:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
the longer and more dense bills that
 
03:04:04.250 --> 03:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
you've had to
 
03:04:06.290 --> 03:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
resolutions rather that you've had to
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
look through
 
03:04:10.250 --> 03:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
um however I I do assure you that it was
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately necessary to to be such
 
03:04:17.889 --> 03:04:17.899 align:start position:0%
so let's first
 
03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
set the stage for what this is about
 
03:04:22.740 --> 03:04:23.570 align:start position:0%
set the stage for what this is about
um

03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
our founder is when this country was
 
03:04:28.490 --> 03:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
brand new and they were deliberating on
 
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
how they were going to set up this
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
government they had come from a time not
 
03:04:35.889 --> 03:04:35.899 align:start position:0%
so long ago where the church of England
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
had had significant ties to the
 
03:04:40.130 --> 03:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
government of England they were
 
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
effectively the same thing and the
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
church was exercising civil Authority
 
03:04:48.410 --> 03:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
and that is something that they
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
very much wanted to put a stop to which
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
is why we find in the First Amendment to
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
the Constitution the prohibition on the
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
formation of a state Church
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the non-establishment of religion
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what I am going to be
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
appealing to here
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
so the argument that I need to make and
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
that I'd like you to keep an open mind
 
03:05:10.319 --> 03:05:11.210 align:start position:0%
that I'd like you to keep an open mind
to

03:05:11.210 --> 03:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
is that Marxism itself
 
03:05:17.809 --> 03:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
and the various ideologies that stem
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
from it are in fact not
 
03:05:25.370 --> 03:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
um philosophy not economics
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
but actually a religious Dogma
 
03:05:30.769 --> 03:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
Loosely Define what a religion is here
 
03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
so religion
 
03:05:39.170 --> 03:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
is a system of faith it is a number of
 
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
different ideas that people hold
 
03:05:45.889 --> 03:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
about the way the world Works about what
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
it means to be alive what it means to be
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
human the nature of Consciousness and
 
03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
also importantly ideas such as ethical
 
03:05:57.650 --> 03:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
doctrines where do ethics come from why
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
should I not simply hurt somebody why
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
should somebody not simply hurt me these
 
03:06:06.050 --> 03:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
are basic questions that when combined
 
03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
those separately perhaps philosophical
 
03:06:11.809 --> 03:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
but when combined these become elements
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.650 --> 03:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
um and just to help uh Define here when
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
it says historicism I will quickly
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Define that word uh historicism is not
 
03:06:26.929 --> 03:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
the same thing as history historicism is
 
03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
an ideology or a facet of religious
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
belief that suggests that there is a
 
03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
particular path that history is moving
 
03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:37.130 align:start position:0%
particular path that history is moving
on

03:06:37.130 --> 03:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
um perhaps being driven that way by a
 
03:06:42.290 --> 03:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
spirit of History you could say and it
 
03:06:46.490 --> 03:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
has a end point that is predetermined
 
03:06:49.070 --> 03:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
and it's heading to that point and for
 
03:06:51.710 --> 03:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
instance Christianity has a a bit of a
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
historicist nature to it and that
 
03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
Christianity believes that there will be
 
03:06:56.750 --> 03:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
a second coming of Christ
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
leading to the reinstantiation of
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
um essentially Eden
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
well likewise Marxism has this same
 
03:07:11.450 --> 03:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
historicist bent flowing through it in
 
03:07:12.769 --> 03:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
that I believe his history is
 
03:07:16.130 --> 03:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
progressing toward an in-state a utopian
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
in state
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
um and the utopianism of this is very
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
very important to understand
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people when they when
 
03:07:27.170 --> 03:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
they see marks they think Das Capital an
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
economic theory but let me tell you that
 
03:07:33.170 --> 03:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
economic theories do not end in heaven
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's not how when economic theory
 
03:07:37.969 --> 03:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
Works ideas that lead you to a
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
heaven-like utopian future that is
 
03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:42.290 align:start position:0%
heaven-like utopian future that is
prophesied

03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
prophesied
 
03:07:46.910 --> 03:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.309 --> 03:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
so moving on from there
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
Marxism presents many different claims
 
03:07:55.969 --> 03:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
about metaphysics Human Experience
 
03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
the nature of human agency the nature of
 
03:08:01.969 --> 03:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
Consciousness and ethics
 
03:08:04.010 --> 03:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
Marxism tends to view everything through
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
what they call the oppressor oppressed
 
03:08:09.650 --> 03:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
dialectic this Theory goes back a very
 
03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
long ways
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
Marx got the idea from Hegel through
 
03:08:16.849 --> 03:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
reading his book phenomenology of spirit
 
03:08:18.410 --> 03:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
and studying that and being a young
 
03:08:23.050 --> 03:08:23.060 align:start position:0%
hegelian which is a sort of an occultist
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
Gnostic and hermeticist movement that
 
03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
was popular very popular actually in
 
03:08:34.490 --> 03:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
Europe and in America from the mid-1800s
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
through the early 1900s
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hegel took his dialectic from can't
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
can't took his dialectic from presumably
 
03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
Plato So this stuff goes back a very
 
03:08:53.330 --> 03:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
when Marx made his claim to have a
 
03:09:01.130 --> 03:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
theory for Scientific Socialism that's
 
03:09:02.690 --> 03:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
capital S science
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have to make a
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
bit of a detour to the history of the
 
03:09:08.929 --> 03:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
word science
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
science has not always meant what we
 
03:09:13.250 --> 03:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
consider science to be we consider
 
03:09:15.650 --> 03:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
science to be an investigative tool
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
typically when we think of it but
 
03:09:19.730 --> 03:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
especially in Germany at the time
 
03:09:22.490 --> 03:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
science more generally just meant a
 
03:09:24.170 --> 03:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge and they generally broke it
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
down into two types of science you had
 
03:09:27.290 --> 03:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
regular science which was investigative
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
which they did not think very highly of
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then they had another science Hegel
 
03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
referred to the as the science of reason
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
and this was a metaphysical science that
 
03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
was concerned with making prophecies
 
03:09:42.530 --> 03:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
about the end of the world and how we
 
03:09:43.610 --> 03:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
get there
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
again this is a this is a religious
 
03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:49.730 align:start position:0%
again this is a this is a religious
Dogma

03:09:49.730 --> 03:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:54.769 --> 03:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:57.230 --> 03:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
so this this document and I won't go
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
through this entire thing I'm sure you
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
have time to to read it but I want to
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
highlight the important parts of this
 
03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
highlight the important parts of this
because

03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
by the way the Supreme Court has defined
 
03:10:07.969 --> 03:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
previously religion and they've defined
 
03:10:09.530 --> 03:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
it in a very similar manner that I have
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
up at the top here as far as giving rise
 
03:10:15.050 --> 03:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
to duties of conscience and ethics if
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
you've ever heard the term being on the
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
right side of History
 
03:10:22.250 --> 03:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
that term actually comes from the idea
 
03:10:24.170 --> 03:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
of a historicist Doctrine where history
 
03:10:26.330 --> 03:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
is heading in the correct direction and
 
03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
you have to be on the right side of it
 
03:10:30.290 --> 03:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
because at history they actually believe
 
03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
there will be sort of a in a manetized
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
God that will look back and judge you
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
similarly again to Christianity where
 
03:10:38.290 --> 03:10:38.300 align:start position:0%
you will be judged at the end of History
 
03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:43.850 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.850 --> 03:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:10:47.269 --> 03:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:10:49.250 --> 03:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
so let's talk for a minute about the
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
some of the different denominations or
 
03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
branches of Marxism and how this
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
developed over time
 
03:10:57.410 --> 03:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
original Marxism would have obviously
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
begun with Marx early Marx even before
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
his Das Capital book
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
from there it moved on
 
03:11:04.680 --> 03:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
from there it moved on
to

03:11:06.050 --> 03:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:08.809 --> 03:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
from Germany to the U.S
 
03:11:11.990 --> 03:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
through Hitler's rise as Hitler Rose to
 
03:11:14.090 --> 03:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
power many of the Communists in Germany
 
03:11:16.610 --> 03:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
fled of course they were they were being
 
03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
fled of course they were they were being
attacked

03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
attacked
 
03:11:19.790 --> 03:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
some of them settled here in America
 
03:11:22.130 --> 03:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
some of them in New York they formed a
 
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
school where they began sort of
 
03:11:26.570 --> 03:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
retooling Marx's theology because Marx
 
03:11:30.110 --> 03:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
had a prophecy that the dictatorship of
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
the proletariat would arise and this is
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
again this is a this is a prophecy this
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
is not an economic theory a dictator of
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
the proletariat would arise overthrow
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
the existing order and install
 
03:11:46.010 --> 03:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
ultimately communism
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's the sequence of events that
 
03:11:50.450 --> 03:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
03:11:54.410 --> 03:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
so much like the preacher who says Jesus
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
is coming back next week and he gets his
 
03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
disciples together
 
03:12:01.250 --> 03:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
and they have a party and it doesn't
 
03:12:03.530 --> 03:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
happen there was much disappointment
 
03:12:05.690 --> 03:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
among the Communists that it didn't
 
03:12:07.370 --> 03:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
happen so they had to go back to the
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
drawing board and figure out why did
 
03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
this not happen
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
at this point through the Institute of
 
03:12:15.250 --> 03:12:15.260 align:start position:0%
social research AKA The Frankfurt School
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
these marxists retooled his theory from
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
the original sort of quasi-economic
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
theory and they refocused it onto the
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
onto more identity characteristics
 
03:12:30.889 --> 03:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
such as race because what you'll learn
 
03:12:32.330 --> 03:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
through the history of Marxism is that
 
03:12:33.969 --> 03:12:33.979 align:start position:0%
it always attacks something that's real
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
it finds a real fault in society and it
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
seeks to exploit it
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
so when Marx exploited capitalism as he
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
called it he was exploiting real
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
economic problems in America there were
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
real race problems and that is what they
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
sought to exploit by shifting things in
 
03:12:55.130 --> 03:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
that direction and applying what again
 
03:12:58.130 --> 03:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
from there the theory went on
 
03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
um to become even even more centered on
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
race and other identity functions
 
03:13:11.929 --> 03:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
through some of the work of
 
03:13:15.170 --> 03:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
um for instance Kimberly Crenshaw uh her
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
work on critical race Theory
 
03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
work on critical race Theory
um

03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
let's see Kimberly Crenshaw goes on to
 
03:13:25.969 --> 03:13:25.979 align:start position:0%
the gender theorist Judith Butler and
 
03:13:28.849 --> 03:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
some of the others and what are these
 
03:13:30.349 --> 03:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
are is there are different applications
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the of the Gen of the the original
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
Marxist dialectic to different identity
 
03:13:37.969 --> 03:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
Dimensions sex race
 
03:13:40.969 --> 03:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
and what these actually constitute are
 
03:13:43.250 --> 03:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
different denominations within the
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
broader Church of Marxism just like
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
Christianity will have you know
 
03:13:48.650 --> 03:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
Protestants and Catholics are kind of
 
03:13:50.570 --> 03:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
the big two that compete even within
 
03:13:52.610 --> 03:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
protestantism you've got methodists
 
03:13:53.570 --> 03:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
you've got Baptist you've got
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
Presbyterians you've got all these
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
different denominations they don't
 
03:13:59.450 --> 03:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
always agree on everything
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is the same thing throughout
 
03:14:03.410 --> 03:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
history there are splits in the church
 
03:14:06.170 --> 03:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
and they go on to have disagreements
 
03:14:08.450 --> 03:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
about things
 
03:14:12.170 --> 03:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
so skipping on a little bit here
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest problems with what
 
03:14:15.769 --> 03:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
we're facing right now that are a part
 
03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
of this Doctrine are ideas that deeply
 
03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
conflict with what our founding fathers
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
put in place
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
ideas like you actually need to
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
attribute malice and Wrongs and
 
03:14:28.439 --> 03:14:29.870 align:start position:0%
attribute malice and Wrongs and
punishments

03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
punishments
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
to People based on things like class or
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
gender or race not what those actual
 
03:14:40.130 --> 03:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
people did but what some other person or
 
03:14:42.830 --> 03:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
some historical context related to their
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
identity did
 
03:14:46.849 --> 03:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
and that that is not something the
 
03:14:48.410 --> 03:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
founding fathers ever would have gone
 
03:14:48.420 --> 03:14:51.710 align:start position:0%
founding fathers ever would have gone
for

03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
see

03:14:54.830 --> 03:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll wrap it up with this
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is not some
 
03:15:06.230 --> 03:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
crackpot idea this is Cutting Edge stuff
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who are coming
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
to this same conclusion looking at the
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
history of what has happened here and
 
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
where we find ourselves now this is
 
03:15:16.010 --> 03:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
being advanced in other places there is
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
a similar resolution that is happening
 
03:15:22.190 --> 03:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
at the federal level along these not
 
03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
exact lines but similar lines
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to
 
03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
take any questions on that
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for offering to take questions
 
03:15:36.170 --> 03:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh I have one
 
03:15:38.809 --> 03:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
on page two at the bottom uh actually
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
the very last two last two lines 36 and
 
03:15:45.769 --> 03:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
37 uh it's it resolve after all the
 
03:15:47.929 --> 03:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
whereas is it says resolved by the House
 
03:15:50.330 --> 03:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
of Representatives
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
um it refers to a complete faith system
 
03:15:57.650 --> 03:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
which which I I get that with Doctrine
 
03:16:02.210 --> 03:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
Dogma ritual thesaurus Theory but the
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
the word spirits and Magic
 
03:16:08.650 --> 03:16:08.660 align:start position:0%
um I think people are going to want to
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
have you explain that better
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
Spirit what spirits and Magic are
 
03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
associated with Marxist yes I'd be
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to so as I said this
 
03:16:21.650 --> 03:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
this ideology and these ideas this
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
Theology and theosophy theosophy being
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
the combining of multiple religions
 
03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
which is what has really happened here
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
goes back a very long time and at the
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
root of the what you would call the
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
dialectic as Hegel applied it is
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually hermetic Alchemy
 
03:16:41.929 --> 03:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
and hermetic Alchemy is an idea it is it
 
03:16:44.450 --> 03:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
is a very deep religious system that was
 
03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
competing with early Christianity
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
it is a concept that God created the
 
03:16:52.490 --> 03:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
world poured himself into the world he
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
overflowed into the world but he created
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
the world because he didn't know himself
 
03:16:59.450 --> 03:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
and it is only through the actions of
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
people through creating things and
 
03:17:04.190 --> 03:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
understanding them that God then
 
03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
understands himself and at the end of
 
03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:08.330 align:start position:0%
understands himself and at the end of
History

03:17:08.330 --> 03:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
History
 
03:17:11.450 --> 03:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
he recognizes himself to be God that's
 
03:17:13.130 --> 03:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
the that's sort of the Baseline
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
hermeticist idea now throughout history
 
03:17:17.210 --> 03:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
especially throughout the Dark Ages
 
03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
there were various what you might call
 
03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
Magic rituals surrounding this if you've
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
heard of alchemy this idea of turning
 
03:17:25.490 --> 03:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
base Metals into gold
 
03:17:28.490 --> 03:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of similar things
 
03:17:30.889 --> 03:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
happening here
 
03:17:32.809 --> 03:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
um with even even some of the modern
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
stuff but they've they've changed the
 
03:17:37.370 --> 03:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
nature of it over time so whereas they
 
03:17:39.650 --> 03:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
would often try to literally turn lead
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
into gold early on now they're they're
 
03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
concerned with this idea that the Utopia
 
03:17:49.130 --> 03:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
Lies Beneath all that currently exists
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
so you have to destroy all that
 
03:17:52.130 --> 03:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
currently exists to get to that Utopia
 
03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
and they have to go through rituals of
 
03:17:56.809 --> 03:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
purification rituals of of
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
um if you've ever heard of a maoist
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
struggle session this idea of denying
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
that you have these beliefs these
 
03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
reactionary beliefs this is actually a
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
ritual it's a ritual of of purifying
 
03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
ritual it's a ritual of of purifying
yourself

03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
03:18:12.889 --> 03:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's part of the when I
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
say magic I don't mean they have literal
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
magic they're not it comes down to that
 
03:18:20.330 --> 03:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
and it also comes down to what Catholic
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
philosopher uh Joseph peeper called the
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
abusive language the abuse of power and
 
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
they actually through the manipulation
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
of language
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
um can keep people confused about what's
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:18:35.090 --> 03:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
and we see a lot of that as well so
 
03:18:37.969 --> 03:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I mean by um rituals
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
and Magic
 
03:18:41.210 --> 03:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for that other questions
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Finney
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
I have a few if
 
03:18:46.610 --> 03:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
um if you'll indulge me
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for I'm being here to
 
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
speak on this issue so
 
03:18:54.590 --> 03:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like and
 
03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna say this I'm gonna try to
 
03:18:59.650 --> 03:18:59.660 align:start position:0%
say this so this bill is essentially an
 
03:19:02.690 --> 03:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
anti-uh this establishmentarianism bill
 
03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:04.429 align:start position:0%
anti-uh this establishmentarianism bill
correct

03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:19:04.439 --> 03:19:06.370 align:start position:0%
correct
anti

03:19:06.370 --> 03:19:06.380 align:start position:0%
anti
 
03:19:08.570 --> 03:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
disestablishmentarianism yep can you
 
03:19:11.690 --> 03:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
define that so it's it's against the
 
03:19:14.570 --> 03:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
establishment of any
 
03:19:14.580 --> 03:19:15.530 align:start position:0%
establishment of any
um

03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:17.450 --> 03:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
Chinese establishmentarianism so it's
 
03:19:19.849 --> 03:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
like a it's like a philosophy uh just
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
based on not allowing the state to
 
03:19:24.889 --> 03:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
establish cultural and uh societal ideas
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I what I would say is it's really
 
03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
so there's there's the the truth about
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the bill the idea behind the bill the
 
03:19:34.370 --> 03:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
philosophical foundation of the bill is
 
03:19:34.380 --> 03:19:35.690 align:start position:0%
philosophical foundation of the bill is
that

03:19:35.690 --> 03:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
um these things are correct and I've put
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
them down on paper and I believe that
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
are true the Practical side of the bill
 
03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
is that I believe that the way they've
 
03:19:46.849 --> 03:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
been implemented today in in government
 
03:19:50.210 --> 03:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
and in education these ideas are
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
violative of the first amendment's
 
03:19:54.590 --> 03:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
protection from being forced to
 
03:19:57.410 --> 03:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
participate in the religious practices
 
03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
that you don't hold or the religion that
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
you don't hold it's a it's a violation
 
03:20:04.490 --> 03:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
of individual liberties and rights and
 
03:20:07.250 --> 03:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's also a violation of the very nature
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the way this country was set up to
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
have as I said these metaphysical
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
presuppositions you have to go all the
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
way down to your deepest beliefs in
 
03:20:18.230 --> 03:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
order to examine things like why do we
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
believe that the innocent should be
 
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
proven or should be innocent until
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
proven guilty instead of just being
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
called guilty because of the color of
 
03:20:28.190 --> 03:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
their skin or their class and we've seen
 
03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
these things throughout history happen
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
03:20:34.429 --> 03:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
follow up one follow-up
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
well I only get one okay
 
03:20:39.290 --> 03:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
well at least one I only have two left
 
03:20:40.849 --> 03:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
is that okay
 
03:20:43.969 --> 03:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
two follow-ups thank you I appreciate it
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I want to just to get some
 
03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
clarification on the on the the the way
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm framing my question here and and I
 
03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
will say for the record that um I am an
 
03:20:54.530 --> 03:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
outspoken atheist and I think it's
 
03:20:57.230 --> 03:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
important that we do uphold uh The
 
03:20:58.490 --> 03:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause of the First
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment because
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
um it is not appropriate for religion to
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
be included and you know in any
 
03:21:05.570 --> 03:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
government proceeding so I ask you
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
though is it the role of government to
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
affirm or deny the acceptance of of
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
subjectively unpopular ideas
 
03:21:15.050 --> 03:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh in the way that that that we would
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
try to control a narrative some way or
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
try to gatekeep people from believing in
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
what they believe in
 
03:21:24.230 --> 03:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh let me break that apart into two
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
different tracks so first the Supreme
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
Court has already previously established
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
precedent defining
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
um what a religion would be
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
um so the the idea that we would try to
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
impose a definition of religion onto
 
03:21:38.279 --> 03:21:39.469 align:start position:0%
impose a definition of religion onto
this

03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
um we would be looking at Supreme Court
 
03:21:42.769 --> 03:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
precedent but for a more generalist
 
03:21:42.779 --> 03:21:44.150 align:start position:0%
precedent but for a more generalist
perspective

03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
I believe that as a as a group of people
 
03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
who use language none of us individually
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
own language you can't no no individual
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
person can say well this isn't that
 
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe it's that it's
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
language and stab is an established
 
03:22:00.410 --> 03:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
thing that has consistent meaning over
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
time or it ceases to be useful
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so in that context yes I do believe
 
03:22:06.650 --> 03:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly appropriate to call
 
03:22:08.450 --> 03:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
something like this religion even if
 
03:22:10.250 --> 03:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
somebody might disagree who believes
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
these things
 
03:22:13.130 --> 03:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
um the other if you remind me what the
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
the last party question was so I can
 
03:22:16.610 --> 03:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
um is it the role of government to
 
03:22:16.620 --> 03:22:18.110 align:start position:0%
um is it the role of government to
subjectively

03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
subjectively
 
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
um affirm or deny the acceptance or
 
03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
denial of of you know Society cultural
 
03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
ideas okay so on that one there's
 
03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
nothing in in this resolution whatsoever
 
03:22:30.410 --> 03:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
that would call for the government to
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
restrict the religious practice of
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
Marxism nothing whatsoever it just says
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
that because it is a religious practice
 
03:22:38.030 --> 03:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
it can't be forced on other people
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
through government okay and my last
 
03:22:39.899 --> 03:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
through government okay and my last
question

03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about the
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
marketplace of ideas correct
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and we're trying to to retain what we
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
do in these bills to what's happening in
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
our state do you personally find and I
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
would you know assume yes but we could
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
argue the point but are you finding that
 
03:22:59.929 --> 03:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the representative
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
style of government that we're having is
 
03:23:04.490 --> 03:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
being eroded in favor of a you know
 
03:23:06.309 --> 03:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
socialist or Marxist or communist
 
03:23:09.650 --> 03:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
function of government because the way
 
03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
that I see it I think that we are
 
03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
that I see it I think that we are
permanently

03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
um in defense with representative style
 
03:23:16.670 --> 03:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
that we already have in New Hampshire
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I would I would ask do you you
 
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
know feel that that we're you know
 
03:23:21.660 --> 03:23:22.849 align:start position:0%
know feel that that we're you know
getting

03:23:22.849 --> 03:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
getting
 
03:23:24.769 --> 03:23:24.779 align:start position:0%
um to the point where we would see some
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
type of major overhaul I I find that
 
03:23:29.210 --> 03:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
hard to to actually believe yes thank
 
03:23:32.210 --> 03:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
you um so I would direct you to page two
 
03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
beginning at lines 21 and I'll read just
 
03:23:37.969 --> 03:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
a little bit here whereas Marxism seeks
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
equity in the forcible dismantling or
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
inverting of all dialectical hierarchies
 
03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
and power dynamics forcible
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
redistribution of power resources and
 
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
property and intentional Affliction of
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
Repertory injury along collectivist
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
lines those to those oppressor groups
 
03:23:53.809 --> 03:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
further goes on it talks similarly about
 
03:23:53.819 --> 03:23:55.090 align:start position:0%
further goes on it talks similarly about
diversity

03:23:55.090 --> 03:23:55.100 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
authentic Justice and these terms so if
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
you look
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
and you apply these terms to what we see
 
03:24:06.050 --> 03:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
currently in in government yes this this
 
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh this state in the executive branch
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
has a diversity equity and inclusion
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
Council that has had significant impact
 
03:24:16.670 --> 03:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
over how this government works and these
 
03:24:19.729 --> 03:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
are as I demonstrate here I think in
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
totality these are religious Concepts
 
03:24:27.410 --> 03:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one comment on line
 
03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
27 you refer to the emanitization of the
 
03:24:40.849 --> 03:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
estacion and then and I read a lot and I
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
gotta be honest I need to do some
 
03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
homework on some of this language
 
03:24:47.450 --> 03:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative uh but I I thank you for
 
03:24:49.250 --> 03:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I
 
03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
you may hear from me and some of the
 
03:24:53.389 --> 03:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
rest of us during the coming week for
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
some clarification on some of this sure
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
which we will exactly what that is if
 
03:25:01.330 --> 03:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
you'd like just real quick okay
 
03:25:04.849 --> 03:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
Matt so to manage the ashketan the
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
ashketon is this is this idea that at
 
03:25:09.170 --> 03:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
the end of history or at the end of some
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
series of events is going to be an end
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the world or an end of the current
 
03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
ERA end of the current time where we
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
transition into a whole different
 
03:25:20.570 --> 03:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
Paradigm so that's a religious concept
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
and to emanitize it means to bring it
 
03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:24.710 align:start position:0%
and to emanitize it means to bring it
about

03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:25:27.469 --> 03:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's kind of like if if in
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
Christianity without getting in depth
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
post-millennials might believe that you
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
can actually cause Christ to come back
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
after by establishing a Thousand-Year
 
03:25:35.939 --> 03:25:36.769 align:start position:0%
after by establishing a Thousand-Year
rule

03:25:36.769 --> 03:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
so that would be a practice trying to
 
03:25:41.330 --> 03:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
manetize the ash Katana similarly
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
marxists believe they have to do the
 
03:25:46.849 --> 03:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
work of Marxism to to eliminate all the
 
03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
contradictions of the dialectic in order
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
to monetize the ashkan or bring about
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the end of history and enter the Utopia
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you it's very interesting to me
 
03:25:56.570 --> 03:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear from me again
 
03:25:57.769 --> 03:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
during this coming week I'm going to
 
03:25:59.330 --> 03:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
read this and read it again and you may
 
03:26:00.650 --> 03:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
hear from some of the rest of us as well
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
you'll be happy you have one co-sponsor
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the prime
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh representative is it
 
03:26:07.319 --> 03:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh representative is it
representative

03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's representative LaMontagne yes
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative LaMontagne please and
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:26:21.170 --> 03:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that you're asking us
 
03:26:21.180 --> 03:26:22.610 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that you're asking us
to

03:26:22.610 --> 03:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
Define a political philosophy as a
 
03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
Define a political philosophy as a
religion

03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
religion
 
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
where you haven't necessarily heard from
 
03:26:33.290 --> 03:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
people who made them calls themselves
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
marxists that they themselves believe
 
03:26:39.410 --> 03:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
that they are a religion
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
and if you're doing this couldn't this
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
not be applied
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
to people who believe other political
 
03:26:49.670 --> 03:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
theories that may
 
03:26:53.090 --> 03:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
um say capitalism that may also believe
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
their political and economic system
 
03:27:00.290 --> 03:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
results in many other benefits to
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
society that might also be con conceived
 
03:27:04.969 --> 03:27:04.979 align:start position:0%
of as having
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
a religious perspective or end game
 
03:27:10.849 --> 03:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
whatever you might call it and aren't
 
03:27:13.370 --> 03:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
you worried that
 
03:27:13.380 --> 03:27:14.809 align:start position:0%
you worried that
um

03:27:14.809 --> 03:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:16.849 --> 03:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
you know you may have unintended
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
consequences thank you thank you very
 
03:27:20.690 --> 03:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
much for the question and that's a very
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
important question
 
03:27:23.929 --> 03:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
um so going back to the Supreme Court
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has established
 
03:27:27.290 --> 03:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
precedent for a number of different
 
03:27:29.929 --> 03:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
items that must be met before something
 
03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
can be properly considered according to
 
03:27:35.269 --> 03:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
them anyway a religious Doctrine
 
03:27:37.130 --> 03:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
um so you can't you can't necessarily
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
just take a political ideology and say
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
because this political ideology believes
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
that it's a religion there has to be a
 
03:27:45.410 --> 03:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
whole host of different things going on
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
there has to be there has to be an
 
03:27:49.250 --> 03:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
ethical system that gives rise to duties
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
of conscience there has to be concepts
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
of historicism or a
 
03:27:59.090 --> 03:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um or an end times theory that go along
 
03:28:00.110 --> 03:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:28:01.610 --> 03:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
um to give you to give you a quote that
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
helps support
 
03:28:05.450 --> 03:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
um some of that for instance one of the
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
I believe it was Herbert Marcus one of
 
03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Frankfurt School marxists said
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
um communism is exactly the religion
 
03:28:13.849 --> 03:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
that must overthrow Christianity in the
 
03:28:13.859 --> 03:28:15.349 align:start position:0%
that must overthrow Christianity in the
West

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
West
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
um so there may be some disagreement
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
among marxists or Communists but some of
 
03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
them clearly and many of them throughout
 
03:28:25.250 --> 03:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
history have believed it to be uh
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
religion and just to make a point on the
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
last thing and I love bringing this up
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
because it it's really interesting
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh capitalism is actually a term that
 
03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
was coined by marxists
 
03:28:39.889 --> 03:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
um and it's not really something that
 
03:28:42.530 --> 03:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
exists because capitalism within the
 
03:28:46.570 --> 03:28:46.580 align:start position:0%
Marxist or ideology theology is a system
 
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
that perpetuates itself through a
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
magical property called Capital it's not
 
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
what we normally think of as capital
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
like cash it has a magical property to
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
it that self-perpetuates over time in
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
order to keep the oppressed down
 
03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
and so there's actually a magical idea
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that goes along with that
 
03:29:06.650 --> 03:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so what we have is is free markets or
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
we I wish we had free markets rather but
 
03:29:11.330 --> 03:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
um it isn't technically capitalism
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
because capitalism is a Marxist concept
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
with metaphysical underpinnings that
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
just can't be escaped
 
03:29:23.090 --> 03:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:25.130 --> 03:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative thank you
 
03:29:28.370 --> 03:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
very much and at this time we will call
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
a uh an adjourman to that particular
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
hearing now we have one more item on our
 
03:29:32.640 --> 03:29:33.710 align:start position:0%
hearing now we have one more item on our
uh

03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:38.939 --> 03:29:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:44.929 --> 03:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.939 --> 03:29:54.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:29:54.250 --> 03:29:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay so uh when I was looking to do was
 
03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
now that uh representative Petrino is
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
here he's asked for just two minutes to
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
introduce this measure uh and then I'm
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
looking to recess uh from this measure a
 
03:30:12.229 --> 03:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
second time and we'll come back at 1 30
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
to to finish uh any discussion or
 
03:30:17.690 --> 03:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
anything else on this after you
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
introduce this and so we'll come back at
 
03:30:22.190 --> 03:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
1 30 and then after we finish with this
 
03:30:25.610 --> 03:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go into executive session so uh
 
03:30:27.290 --> 03:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
represent getting thanks for hanging in
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
for two or three more minutes and
 
03:30:30.889 --> 03:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno uh welcome to
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
speak to HR 7. have Mr chair before my
 
03:30:37.130 --> 03:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
friend from Milford begins uh could I
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
ask a housekeeping question of the chair
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
sure Mr chair will be Saturday at nine
 
03:30:42.650 --> 03:30:42.660 align:start position:0%
o'clock and this committee really has
 
03:30:45.769 --> 03:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
worked hard and well on the leadership
 
03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
um I noticed at noon time the
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
temperature in Concord was seven above
 
03:30:52.250 --> 03:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
with a wind chill of minus 13. and I
 
03:30:53.570 --> 03:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
know members of the committee of outside
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
commitments would it be possible to go
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
with our executive session till four
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
o'clock recess and then special order
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
any bills left to next Friday
 
03:31:06.889 --> 03:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
okay so you're asking about executive
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
session going possibly until four
 
03:31:12.889 --> 03:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
o'clock yes sir yes uh I I hear what
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying and we you never know how
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
long a certain you just don't know how
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
long these things can take some some I
 
03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
think some of these I think will go
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
through fairly quickly but to your point
 
03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes uh if if it gets that late we will
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh recess and we'll finish next week
 
03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sure
 
03:31:31.969 --> 03:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
okay represent their inceptions social
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
security and Medicare have made great
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
strides in reducing poverty in the
 
03:31:39.170 --> 03:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
United States among seniors and the
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
disabled as lawmakers in Washington D.C
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
talk about entitlement reform in other
 
03:31:48.410 --> 03:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
words cutting these programs it's
 
03:31:50.210 --> 03:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
important to just take a look at some of
 
03:31:51.889 --> 03:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
the facts
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
Social Security by Statute does not
 
03:31:58.790 --> 03:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
hamper the federal deficit in any way
 
03:32:01.010 --> 03:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
it is entirely self-funded through
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
payroll taxations
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
President Ronald Reagan made this point
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
03:32:10.190 --> 03:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
when he said social security has nothing
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do with the deficit Social Security
 
03:32:16.010 --> 03:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
is totally funded by the payroll tax
 
03:32:19.490 --> 03:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
living on employers and employees social
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
security has nothing to do with
 
03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
balancing a budget or an erasing or
 
03:32:26.269 --> 03:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
growing the deficit
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
now in order to fix Social Security
 
03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
without cutting benefits we can raise
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
the cap on taxable income presently if
 
03:32:35.330 --> 03:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
you make a million dollars a year you
 
03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
only pay social security taxes on the
 
03:32:40.370 --> 03:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
first 147 thousand dollars
 
03:32:43.969 --> 03:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
due to increasing income inequality a
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
historically low number of Americans 83
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
percent uh paying Social Security taxes
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
if we ask the wealthy to pay their fair
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
share we can make the program solvent
 
03:32:58.370 --> 03:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
so raising the cap secures the trust
 
03:32:58.380 --> 03:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
so raising the cap secures the trust
fund

03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
this resolution will affirm the New
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House's commitment to
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
supporting Social Security and Medicare
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony thank
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
and other will you take questions are as
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
best I can are there any questions at
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
this time before I go to represent
 
03:33:23.330 --> 03:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
infinity I do want to point out as I
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I plan to recess this hearing and
 
03:33:30.410 --> 03:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
come back to it at 1 30. we'll continue
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
with questions and if there's anyone who
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
comes in at that time that wants to
 
03:33:37.010 --> 03:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
speak to this measure at 1 30 we will
 
03:33:39.410 --> 03:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
give them that time if and if there
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
isn't anyone then we'll go into exact
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
session from there so that's how we will
 
03:33:45.889 --> 03:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
handle that and representative Finney go
 
03:33:45.899 --> 03:33:47.690 align:start position:0%
handle that and representative Finney go
ahead

03:33:47.690 --> 03:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I am seeing a report here that the
 
03:33:56.690 --> 03:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
unfunded uh uh that's liabilities for
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
these programs as of 2021 is 29.9
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars
 
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you see us you know
 
03:34:08.090 --> 03:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
gaining solvency when when that's it's
 
03:34:10.429 --> 03:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
like 128
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
um percent of our GDP it's like it's how
 
03:34:15.170 --> 03:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
do we sustain that it's you know it just
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
seems impossible
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
well I guess some would say that it
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
seems impossible but as I had mentioned
 
03:34:21.969 --> 03:34:21.979 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that if more
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
individuals uh pay their fair share and
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
we raise that cap that might be one way
 
03:34:28.969 --> 03:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
to to close to close that Gap and deal
 
03:34:31.309 --> 03:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
with that uh problem the bottom line is
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
we don't want to uh leave our seniors
 
03:34:36.050 --> 03:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
and disabled individuals without a
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
safety net I can speak to personal
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
experiences I can just think back to my
 
03:34:42.410 --> 03:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
own parents and how Social Security was
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
a benefit for them and and of course
 
03:34:47.330 --> 03:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
many of us are on Medicare and on social
 
03:34:49.790 --> 03:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
security so this is something that is
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
not an entitlement it is something that
 
03:34:54.050 --> 03:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
we actually pay for and it has nothing
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the budget or the deficit so
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
I do believe that this is something that
 
03:35:00.769 --> 03:35:00.779 align:start position:0%
we can manage if we take if we take it
 
03:35:00.779 --> 03:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
we can manage if we take if we take it
seriously

03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay we have some pictures thank you for
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
your pink card and so I'm not going to
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
adjourn this hearing I'm going to recess
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
it as I said at 1 30 we will come back
 
03:35:19.849 --> 03:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
and if any of the members or if anyone
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
else wants to speak to HR 7 they'll have
 
03:35:26.349 --> 03:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
that opportunity at 1 30.
 
03:35:30.290 --> 03:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
and if once we finish that uh if there
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
is anyone who wants to speak on the
 
03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
record uh on on the recording on HR 7
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
we'll have that opportunity and right
 
03:35:40.190 --> 03:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
after that we'll go right into executive
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
session and as I said the Reps of
 
03:35:45.170 --> 03:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
Representative shortliff we will go
 
03:35:49.130 --> 03:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
until four at which time we will recess
 
03:35:51.410 --> 03:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
but perhaps we'll finish before by that
 
03:35:53.330 --> 03:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
time I think some of these will go
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we will see so at this at
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
this time we'll recess until before I
 
03:36:01.729 --> 03:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
hit the gavel uh I'd like the folks on
 
03:36:04.670 --> 03:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
the Republican side to give give us
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
three or four minutes before you head
 
03:36:10.610 --> 03:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
out we'll very quick caucus as soon as I
 
03:37:04.370 --> 03:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
all right folks I'm going to turn the
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
microphone off uh and I'm going to speak
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.450 --> 04:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
okay this is just for the members uh
 
04:22:26.210 --> 04:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh I have a message here
 
04:22:28.929 --> 04:22:28.939 align:start position:0%
from the speaker uh
 
04:22:31.370 --> 04:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
authorizing legislators who have parked
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
at store Street to move the uh your
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle closer to the to this hearing
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
building for as of temperature drops
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody need to or if because if
 
04:22:44.809 --> 04:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
you want to do that you need to do it
 
04:22:48.110 --> 04:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:52.929 --> 04:22:52.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.809 --> 04:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
the question is is that because of an
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
impending crash of store Street Garage
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's weather related not
 
04:23:00.660 --> 04:23:03.189 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's weather related not
structural

04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%

to the introduction you've already made
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
of this measure
 
04:25:01.849 --> 04:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
committee the only point that I'd like
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
to make is that this is merely a
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
resolution of firming that the New
 
04:25:10.010 --> 04:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
supports Social Security and Medicare
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
it's not really for us to decide how
 
04:25:19.570 --> 04:25:19.580 align:start position:0%
Congress is going to rectify the problem
 
04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
it merely is a statement that we believe
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
that Social Security and Medicare is an
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
important safety net that millions of
 
04:25:31.849 --> 04:25:31.859 align:start position:0%
Americans depend on and nothing more so
 
04:25:34.130 --> 04:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
any questions as to how we resolve the
 
04:25:36.050 --> 04:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
problem well that really is a matter for
 
04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay questions for US Representative
 
04:25:49.250 --> 04:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
and representative Kerry
 
04:25:55.250 --> 04:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
so why do you feel this resolution is
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
needed and what impact do you think it
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
will have
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
well I think there's a matter of um
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
philosophical differences
 
04:26:06.889 --> 04:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh the nature and necessity
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
of Social Security and Medicare and
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
there are those of us who believe that
 
04:26:14.689 --> 04:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
it is a very important safety net and we
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
do fear that there are others who would
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
like to see it completely eliminated and
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
that is the concern we do not want to
 
04:26:23.929 --> 04:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
see it eliminated we want to see it to
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
continue and so it really is a matter of
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
political discussion and hopefully the
 
04:26:30.290 --> 04:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
04:26:34.130 --> 04:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
will see fit uh to just affirm the fact
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
that millions of Americans do indeed
 
04:26:39.410 --> 04:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
rely on this it's something that we pay
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
for through payroll deductions we'd like
 
04:26:44.929 --> 04:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
to see it continued and strengthened and
 
04:26:47.929 --> 04:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
again it's just an affirmation of our
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
position as uh representatives of the
 
04:26:50.340 --> 04:26:53.410 align:start position:0%
position as uh representatives of the
people

04:26:53.410 --> 04:26:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.610 --> 04:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay saying none thank you
 
04:27:02.090 --> 04:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno I appreciate
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%

04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
submit a pink slip or pink card to speak
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.429 --> 04:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none at this time we will
 
04:27:19.849 --> 04:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
adjourn the hearing on HR 7 we will have
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
a executive session today and next week
 
04:27:25.729 --> 04:27:25.739 align:start position:0%

hearings we had today and then exact
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
next week now up front I'll

uh
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
given the the weather and the
 
04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:42.110 align:start position:0%
given the the weather and the
deteriorating

04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
deteriorating
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%

04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
um plan to go until if we need to until

04:27:55.969 --> 04:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
you never know how long what type of uh
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh comments and discussion will
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
accompany any of these measures just
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't know so we may finish before four
 
04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
if we do not finish before for whatever
 
04:28:09.649 --> 04:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
is unfinished or whatever we recess we
 
04:28:12.889 --> 04:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
will uh take up next Friday at beginning
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock right now there are five
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
measures scheduled for that time so
 
04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
that's where things stand
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
so given that let's get right to it uh
 
04:28:26.689 --> 04:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
the first Yeah question yes uh Mr
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
chairman two quick things before we
 
04:28:30.649 --> 04:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
begin uh first of my Democratic
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee thinking
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
back to my early years especially I
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
knewa members whenever we'd be an
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
executive session I would never make a
 
04:28:40.849 --> 04:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
motion one way or the other because I
 
04:28:42.110 --> 04:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want to write the blur up the
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee report and uh
 
04:28:46.969 --> 04:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
it's like going to confession but anyway
 
04:28:49.969 --> 04:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
if any of our members want to make a
 
04:28:51.530 --> 04:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
motion I'll be glad to stay and help you
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the blurb if that's an issue and
 
04:28:55.809 --> 04:28:55.819 align:start position:0%
the other one thing I want to say Mr
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
chairman is uh
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%

um and yes as far as blurbs go I've been
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
on other committees and typically the
 
04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
chair will uh insist that the the
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee reports AKA blurbs uh be
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
turned in before the member is allowed
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
to leave this being a Friday uh whoever
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%

uh anything else
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
before we commence

okay let's get right into it then the
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
first measure on our list to exact is

hb229 which doesn't have a fiscal note
 
04:30:02.929 --> 04:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh relative to requiring an official
 
04:30:05.210 --> 04:30:05.220 align:start position:0%

04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair well I'll speak
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
briefly uh I think it's a slippery slope
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
when a state will try to use syrup a
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
federal uh uh the Federal Constitution
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I think uh the 20th Amendment given
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
women the right to vote it was only
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
ratified by one vote in Kentucky uh that
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
the state could say no to that or civil
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
rights or anything else that we've done
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the betterment of the people that
 
04:40:56.930 --> 04:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
live in our country and I uh I don't
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
think we want to go to one state being
 
04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
able to nullify the work of the entire
 
04:41:01.260 --> 04:41:03.770 align:start position:0%
able to nullify the work of the entire
country

04:41:03.770 --> 04:41:03.780 align:start position:0%

representative Shirley have mentioned
 
04:41:14.570 --> 04:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
the 20th Amendment giving women the
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
right to vote I think it might have been
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
the 19th for the record uh we want to
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh that we have that
 
04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%

I'm thinking back to early discussion
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
today which had to do with retain
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I have it written on the wrong one
 
04:44:34.368 --> 04:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so the motion is to retain is
 
04:44:36.650 --> 04:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
is there a second to the motion to
 
04:44:39.288 --> 04:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
retain hcr4
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shurtleff
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion to
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh retain hcr4 uh representative
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
Lundgren or representative shurtleff uh
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
would you represent care to speak to the
 
04:44:52.680 --> 04:44:58.490 align:start position:0%
would you represent care to speak to the
motion

04:44:58.490 --> 04:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
president thank you Mr chairman
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe when Representatives God
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill he talked a lot
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money in uh
 
04:45:10.850 --> 04:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
Congressional politics and um
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
which was one of their motivations for
 
04:45:15.530 --> 04:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
him to file this and so I I think
 
04:45:17.570 --> 04:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
there's some real thoughts about this
 
04:45:19.368 --> 04:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
idea of the money that's going into our
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
national Congressional elections and so
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would support the uh through tension
 
04:45:27.890 --> 04:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sherliff would
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else would anyone else like to
 
04:45:31.850 --> 04:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion
 
04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Finney
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that we should go back to the
 
04:45:41.090 --> 04:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
original uh OTP because we've
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
I've already talked about this in uh
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
concurring bills with Article 5 issues
 
04:45:49.250 --> 04:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
that it's all encompassing for for
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
specific issues I don't think that we
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
need to retain the bill I think that we
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
know what the bill does and we that we
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.730 --> 04:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the motion is
 
04:46:02.690 --> 04:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
to retain uh representative Smith
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
um aside from the fact that I'm
 
04:46:10.850 --> 04:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
fascinated to think that a body that
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
operates without term limits that would
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
be the New Hampshire House of
 
04:46:17.930 --> 04:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives would determine for
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
another legislative body that there
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
should be term limits
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
I find that intriguing
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and not to say wrong just something
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
worthy of note
 
04:46:35.208 --> 04:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
um I uh I personally am
 
04:46:39.530 --> 04:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the money that I
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
believe is inappropriate and corrupting
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
that goes into all elections State and
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
National and would like to see that
 
04:46:52.730 --> 04:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
change I have no reason to believe that
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
term limits would make the change their
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
other direct steps that would have to be
 
04:47:02.448 --> 04:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
taken to make that change so that we no
 
04:47:05.090 --> 04:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
longer are victims of those people who
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
make major contributions to political
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
Activity thank you
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak yes
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.530 --> 04:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
wait where we do have a Convention of
 
04:47:28.010 --> 04:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
states that we need to have things in
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
place before that happens that is very
 
04:47:34.850 --> 04:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
definitive as to what the objective is
 
04:47:40.250 --> 04:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Master Miller would
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
any would anyone else like to speak to
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
I will say to representative Master
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
Miller's point that this is uh it's
 
04:47:54.530 --> 04:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
neither an OTP or an ilt it's it is a
 
04:47:56.090 --> 04:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
and not knowing at this time what will
 
04:48:02.090 --> 04:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
happen with uh the hdr1 measure or the
 
04:48:04.610 --> 04:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
convention of the states we can uh
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
because if this passes it will be
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
retained and is something that we can
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
bring back
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
um within the year
 
04:48:16.250 --> 04:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
to your point so this still could be
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
used in that fashion except if the
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
retain measure passes it wouldn't be
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
able to be used immediately for that
 
04:48:22.440 --> 04:48:23.868 align:start position:0%
able to be used immediately for that
purpose

04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%

Morton
yes

04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%

04:49:20.930 --> 04:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Smith yes okay and Lamontagne
 
04:49:20.940 --> 04:49:22.430 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Smith yes okay and Lamontagne
yes

04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%

yes
O'Neill

04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
O'Neill
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
so we've got one two on the chair
 
04:49:31.798 --> 04:49:36.770 align:start position:0%
so we've got one two on the chair
yes

04:49:36.770 --> 04:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.770 --> 04:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
one two seven eight nine ten eleven
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
twelve thirteen fourteen
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:48.650 --> 04:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
so the count is 14 in favor of the
 
04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
motion it retained four against
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
so I will work on a majority Report with
 
04:49:58.490 --> 04:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lundgren will would uh
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
would someone care to make a Minority
 
04:50:00.480 --> 04:50:02.030 align:start position:0%
would someone care to make a Minority
Report

04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
Report
 
04:50:02.040 --> 04:50:02.890 align:start position:0%
Report
um

04:50:02.890 --> 04:50:02.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
on this on this retainer although
 
04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
04:50:11.810 --> 04:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
procedurally uh representative shirtle
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
if you may know this on a retain measure
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
typically are there two or more if if
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the vote is split
 
04:50:22.250 --> 04:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay that thing that thank you Christine
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
that clears up my question so on a
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
retained measure there's no need for
 
04:50:29.330 --> 04:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
either a majority or Minority Report
 
04:50:32.208 --> 04:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
well it's retained thank you that
 
04:50:35.208 --> 04:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
answers that okay
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh the next measure is uh yeah very high
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
profile measure this is the one that we
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
had the hearing on a week ago in Repsol
 
04:50:45.170 --> 04:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
that was had a a very large number of
 
04:50:48.650 --> 04:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
people attend and testify this is uh the
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
resolution applying for a Convention of
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
the states under Article 5 of The
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States HCR
 
04:50:55.680 --> 04:50:57.410 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States HCR
one

04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Finney do you have a
 
04:51:03.410 --> 04:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
motion on this measure I do I move that
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh we ought to pass hcr1 and I'll speak
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
to my motion okay do we have a second
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative massimilla seconds uh
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Finney's
 
04:51:20.448 --> 04:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
OTP motion on HCR one represent Finney
 
04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion I
 
04:51:24.890 --> 04:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
would uh thank you um well you know from
 
04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
all the information that we've heard in
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
the last couple weeks about what an
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention actually does and
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
what it does not do I think we can
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
safely assume that all the safeguards in
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
place the amount of states that would
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
have to apply and then have to ratify an
 
04:51:39.170 --> 04:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
amendment that all of the myths and the
 
04:51:41.690 --> 04:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the mongering on
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
fear on what a convention what or
 
04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do is is false I think that um
 
04:51:49.610 --> 04:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're at the point politically and
 
04:51:52.010 --> 04:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
socially and culturally where we need to
 
04:51:54.288 --> 04:51:54.298 align:start position:0%
actually have you know systemic changes
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
in in the way that our that our federal
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
government functions and the founders
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
Incorporated that in our constitution
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
it's the safest you know most
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
non-violent way to uh to do this and we
 
04:52:07.208 --> 04:52:07.218 align:start position:0%
need to rein back the power of congress
 
04:52:11.330 --> 04:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
and uh flip the power Dynamic back to
 
04:52:12.890 --> 04:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
the States over the federal government
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can assert our sovereignty
 
04:52:17.930 --> 04:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
and you know and protect our future I
 
04:52:20.090 --> 04:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
think it's the best way to do it this
 
04:52:21.770 --> 04:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee has a history of not passing
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
these bills um based on uh uh you know
 
04:52:28.610 --> 04:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
the information from the other side that
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
would say that this this would uh
 
04:52:34.610 --> 04:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
harm our process or or our functionality
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I just I just don't see how that's
 
04:52:36.240 --> 04:52:37.310 align:start position:0%
and I just I just don't see how that's
possible

04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:52:40.250 --> 04:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
um all the information that we got uh
 
04:52:41.770 --> 04:52:41.780 align:start position:0%
from the experts
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly states that this is the
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
best way to achieve what we're trying to
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
do as a country and uh it's got to start
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.650 --> 04:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Massa Miller who made the second would
 
04:52:58.368 --> 04:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to to the to the
 
04:52:58.378 --> 04:52:59.330 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to to the to the
measure

04:52:59.330 --> 04:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
measure
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing
 
04:53:00.840 --> 04:53:02.990 align:start position:0%
the only thing
I is

04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
I is
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
that the forefathers were wise enough to
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
realize that when men become it come
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
into power and are authoritative that
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes that power can be misused and
 
04:53:17.448 --> 04:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
then what are we left with we're left
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
with the people trying to make a
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
decision as to what to do and I think
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
they were wise enough to put that as an
 
04:53:24.540 --> 04:53:25.550 align:start position:0%
they were wise enough to put that as an
article

04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that we should respect that
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing I read a quote
 
04:53:32.330 --> 04:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
the other day that I think is applicable
 
04:53:38.570 --> 04:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
it says fear and faith both demand that
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
you believe in something that you cannot
 
04:53:44.930 --> 04:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
see and you make the choice and I think
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
faith is what's needed here as far as
 
04:53:51.050 --> 04:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
um yes maybe it's never been done before
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
though some people say yes it has but
 
04:53:56.330 --> 04:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
that it was put into the Constitution I
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
think is important so thank you
 
04:54:01.730 --> 04:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative massanola uh
 
04:54:01.740 --> 04:54:03.708 align:start position:0%
thank you representative massanola uh
representative

04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman there
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
are times that I wish I had the
 
04:54:10.250 --> 04:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
eloquence of my friend from Durham
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and this is one of
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
those times uh
 
04:54:16.550 --> 04:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the bill and we'll be
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
voting no I thank the sponsors for
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
bringing it in and the information they
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
gave us all in good faith uh but in my
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
heart of hearts I just cannot support a
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention I still have
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
concerns about other issues being
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
brought up and for that reason I'll be
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
voting no thank you Mr chairman
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:54:39.770 --> 04:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Finney you've already
 
04:54:41.330 --> 04:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
spoken to your motion before I go back
 
04:54:43.970 --> 04:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
to you uh
 
04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
someone who has yet to speak on the
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
motion is there anyone else who would
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
like to do so
 
04:54:53.570 --> 04:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'll have a comment myself uh but go
 
04:54:55.610 --> 04:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Finney to to
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
clarify what we're voting on is not a
 
04:54:59.150 --> 04:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention it's an
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention there are two
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know completely separate things the
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention is to create a
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
new Constitution Article 5 is just to
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
propose amendments which is what our
 
04:55:10.730 --> 04:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
right is to do we
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.128 --> 04:55:16.138 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all um Mr chair
 
04:55:22.368 --> 04:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
ordinarily I believe that the gentleman
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
from Concord is very accurate in what he
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
says but he really was I think saying
 
04:55:30.530 --> 04:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
something not quite accurate to indicate
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
that he is not the most eloquent person
 
04:55:36.170 --> 04:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
in the room I think he is
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
um on another Point
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I um it's been a long time since I
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
have been in the classroom as a student
 
04:55:48.530 --> 04:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
but not a long time since I've studied
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and and lots of
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
material relating to it perhaps I'm
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
wrong but I remember very clearly that
 
04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
when the Articles of Confederation were
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
not working the way the people wanted
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
them to work
 
04:56:09.050 --> 04:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
um they asked for an opportunity to
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
amend the Articles of Confederation and
 
04:56:13.570 --> 04:56:13.580 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
04:56:19.610 --> 04:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
was to eventually end up creating
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
the Constitution to which all of us in
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
this room have
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
tended to varying degrees
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
to pledge our Allegiance I
 
04:56:35.690 --> 04:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
do not believe that the country
 
04:56:35.700 --> 04:56:36.350 align:start position:0%
do not believe that the country
um

04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
is perfect I don't believe that the
 
04:56:41.690 --> 04:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
constitution is perfect but for any for
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
for several hundred years we have limped
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
along trying to make it better and
 
04:56:48.240 --> 04:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
along trying to make it better and
better

04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that we would not do
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
anything that might
 
04:56:57.360 --> 04:56:58.448 align:start position:0%
anything that might
um

04:56:58.448 --> 04:56:58.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
interfere with that constancy as we have
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
worked together to form a more perfect
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
I I plan to vote against the um the
 
04:57:16.128 --> 04:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh reps of
 
04:57:17.760 --> 04:57:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh reps of
gagne

04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.730 --> 04:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just plain bread
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
high school graduate
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer doctor or anything I
 
04:57:31.250 --> 04:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
don't have any you know what
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
the things that I did I did with my
 
04:57:35.090 --> 04:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
fists I was a martial arts instructor
 
04:57:36.650 --> 04:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
back in the day
 
04:57:36.660 --> 04:57:38.270 align:start position:0%
back in the day
now

04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:57:40.850 --> 04:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
this is my eighth term
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
all the previous terms I voted no to an
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
article five
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
I wasn't that informed this time out
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
something came out about this thick
 
04:57:57.288 --> 04:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
and believe it or not this High School
 
04:57:59.868 --> 04:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
guy read the whole thing
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I found out that you know the people
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
have got to have a voice in what goes on
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
in our government because it's for us
 
04:58:12.410 --> 04:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
not for them it's for us so I am going
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
to be wholeheartedly voting for this
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
along those same lines uh I've always
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
been a proponent of article five as a
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism to
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
keep the federal government in check
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's been the sole body to propose and
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
have amendments passed and the states
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
have that power it was put there for a
 
04:58:43.490 --> 04:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
reason because there are things that
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
Congress itself will not propose to fix
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
itself so it must be up to the states to
 
04:58:52.368 --> 04:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.010 --> 04:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:58:58.010 --> 04:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
I have a couple thoughts
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh I am like representative gagne in
 
04:59:05.448 --> 04:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
that uh this is not a measure I
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
supported in the past uh it came to this
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee last term and uh
 
04:59:15.050 --> 04:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
I want to say was on consent I I there
 
04:59:19.550 --> 04:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
was uh not much energy or interest in it
 
04:59:21.470 --> 04:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh last term
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
but that was last term and I I must say
 
04:59:24.600 --> 04:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
but that was last term and I I must say
that

04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:28.368 --> 04:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
like representative gagne
 
04:59:28.378 --> 04:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
like representative gagne
um

04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
I try to honor the people who came and
 
04:59:34.250 --> 04:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
testified of which we had many many many
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
more this term than last term
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I did some reading as as
 
04:59:43.250 --> 04:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative gagne did and I listened
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
and again the reason that we were in
 
04:59:48.410 --> 04:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
reps Hall last week was because of the
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh the volume the the great number of
 
04:59:53.570 --> 04:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to weigh in on on this
 
04:59:53.580 --> 04:59:54.890 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to weigh in on on this
measure

04:59:54.890 --> 04:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
measure
 
04:59:56.810 --> 04:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that I've kind of
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh concluded is that a lot of the
 
05:00:02.810 --> 05:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
opposition to the to this measure is
 
05:00:05.570 --> 05:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
largely fear driven which is not unusual
 
05:00:09.170 --> 05:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh almost any measure that we we uh deal
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
with the opponents of it will try to you
 
05:00:16.010 --> 05:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
know Stoke fears for one of a better
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
term because they think that it's not
 
05:00:20.288 --> 05:00:20.298 align:start position:0%
the best way to go
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh but again if you go back to the
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
Federalist Papers or the founders
 
05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
there's a reason that they had this they
 
05:00:32.208 --> 05:00:32.218 align:start position:0%
put this mechanism in place they put
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
this uh this option this mechanism in
 
05:00:39.288 --> 05:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
place as a as a as an option for
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh us to utilize
 
05:00:47.090 --> 05:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
um if necessary earlier today I found it
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
very interesting in a hearing of a
 
05:00:51.948 --> 05:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
different Bill uh that had to do with uh
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the Constitution uh I
 
05:00:57.650 --> 05:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
believe it was the 21st Amendment which
 
05:01:00.050 --> 05:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
repealed prohibition that came up this
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
morning and it was pointed out that the
 
05:01:06.170 --> 05:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
movement there was an article 5 movement
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
of four
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh the prohibition measure and because
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
of that article 5 movement the
 
05:01:16.490 --> 05:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
traditional uh way of amending the
 
05:01:18.050 --> 05:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
Constitution came about we got article
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
21 which perhaps would not have happened
 
05:01:23.090 --> 05:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
the same way if at all had it not been
 
05:01:26.448 --> 05:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
for the the chance for a uh an article 5
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
convention so I'm going to stop there
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
other than you can see where I'm going
 
05:01:33.650 --> 05:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
with this I I'm going to vote for this
 
05:01:35.090 --> 05:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
measure this time around and then
 
05:01:37.070 --> 05:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
another point I want to make is
 
05:01:39.890 --> 05:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
that I've learned that in the past this
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee is like I said it came up last
 
05:01:43.550 --> 05:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
term but another term that came up and
 
05:01:44.770 --> 05:01:44.780 align:start position:0%
it came out of this committee
 
05:01:47.570 --> 05:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
unanimously in favor of an article 5
 
05:01:50.330 --> 05:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
convention and procedurally it did not
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
get to the Senate so there's some
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
interesting history on both sides uh for
 
05:02:00.288 --> 05:02:00.298 align:start position:0%
this measure in the past so and the
 
05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
final thing I I want to say is that
 
05:02:05.570 --> 05:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
committees have a lot of power
 
05:02:07.250 --> 05:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and if something comes out of
 
05:02:09.470 --> 05:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
one way or the other it matters usually
 
05:02:15.170 --> 05:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
a lot on the house floor
 
05:02:19.090 --> 05:02:19.100 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see the the
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
this measure move forward so
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
other folks can give it full
 
05:02:25.730 --> 05:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
consideration which I think is more
 
05:02:27.890 --> 05:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
likely to happen if it comes out of this
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
committee uh with a favorable
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation rather than rather than
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
to kill it so those are my thoughts on
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
it does anyone else have anything that
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
they would like to speak yes
 
05:02:45.530 --> 05:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
resonated with me which is when I took a
 
05:02:50.448 --> 05:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
hard look at why my initial reaction to
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
this was no I realized it was fear
 
05:02:55.390 --> 05:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
um and I you know as I look
 
05:02:58.368 --> 05:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
introspectively what I fear more is
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
nothing changing
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and this is the mechanism we have to
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
try to do that
 
05:03:05.208 --> 05:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting yes
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
reps of Kerry
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
as you know I like to follow the money
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
because I believe everything in life
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
goes back to that
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
we had a speaker who was flown in to
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
speak to us I did look up their 990s
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
65.19 million dollars in Revenue this
 
05:03:31.250 --> 05:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
non-profit made
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
it defines itself as a legal Ministry
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
Conservative Christian curtailing rights
 
05:03:39.890 --> 05:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq expanding Christian practices
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
in Public Schools and Government and
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
outlawing abortion that Disturbed me
 
05:03:47.570 --> 05:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
that Disturbed me because this was a
 
05:03:49.610 --> 05:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
keynote speaker and this is what this
 
05:03:51.288 --> 05:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
individual represented
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so while initially
 
05:03:55.128 --> 05:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
I had
 
05:03:57.410 --> 05:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
no concerns with an article 5 convention
 
05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
I began to be concerned because
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
this is the keynote speaker so then I
 
05:04:05.690 --> 05:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
pulled the 990s of the organization I
 
05:04:05.700 --> 05:04:06.708 align:start position:0%
pulled the 990s of the organization I
believe

05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
that has been speaking to us more
 
05:04:12.530 --> 05:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
directly mark meckler would be the head
 
05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
of that organization and I looked up how
 
05:04:17.330 --> 05:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
much he and his wife were making running
 
05:04:19.850 --> 05:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
this organization and as someone with a
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
degree in non-profit management I'm a
 
05:04:23.690 --> 05:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
little Disturbed at how much money these
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
people make advocating
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
for this sort of thing so I'm troubled
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
by following the money because
 
05:04:34.850 --> 05:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
everything in life every action we take
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
goes back to who pulls the strings and
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
who has the money
 
05:04:41.208 --> 05:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
so this is my concern and this is what I
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:04:50.590 --> 05:04:50.600 align:start position:0%

seeing no hands at this time then Madam
 
05:04:55.850 --> 05:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
clerk if you would call the roll on the
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
motion on hcr1 which is a motion to OTP
 
05:05:03.010 --> 05:05:03.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%

hr8 that's
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
urging Congress to enact legislation
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
regulating and banning certain
 
05:07:38.570 --> 05:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic assault weapons in large
 
05:07:41.650 --> 05:07:41.660 align:start position:0%
capacity ammunition feeding devices
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative man you indicated a
 
05:07:47.330 --> 05:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
desire to make a motion motion Ito
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
do I have a second for that motion
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Finney seconds the motion
 
05:07:52.980 --> 05:07:53.868 align:start position:0%
representative Finney seconds the motion
um

05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Manny would you care to
 
05:08:00.288 --> 05:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
speak to emotion uh yes so
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
uh Firearms have a strong uh history in
 
05:08:05.448 --> 05:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
this country and during the testimony
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
there was many things that came up uh
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
one of which is like the Riots of 2020
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh there was many instances where so the
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
there's carve outs in this bill that
 
05:08:16.730 --> 05:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
allow law enforcement to maintain arms
 
05:08:18.530 --> 05:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
as well so there's this whole thing this
 
05:08:20.570 --> 05:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
theory that the uh only people that
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to carry firearms
 
05:08:25.010 --> 05:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
especially those are the law enforcement
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh during the summer of 2020 several
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
businesses across this entire country
 
05:08:32.690 --> 05:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
called out to 9-1-1 to law enforcement
 
05:08:34.970 --> 05:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
agencies they said uh they're you know
 
05:08:36.530 --> 05:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's people outside there's lots of
 
05:08:39.050 --> 05:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
people outside what do I do they said
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
the police are preoccupied you're on
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
your own this entire
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that entire argument in and of itself I
 
05:08:47.448 --> 05:08:47.458 align:start position:0%
think is open and shut but then there
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
was another woman who actually brought
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
up a really good point because the
 
05:08:52.610 --> 05:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
actual purpose of this is for personal
 
05:08:55.490 --> 05:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
defense against all enemies for your
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
person your home your your country
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
because one of the uh testifiers brought
 
05:09:00.780 --> 05:09:01.430 align:start position:0%
because one of the uh testifiers brought
up

05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:09:03.650 --> 05:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
Ukraine which I thought was really
 
05:09:06.770 --> 05:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
important because the people of Ukraine
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
were disarmed by their country decades
 
05:09:09.480 --> 05:09:10.610 align:start position:0%
were disarmed by their country decades
back

05:09:10.610 --> 05:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:09:13.250 --> 05:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
and during the invasion they are
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
scrambling now to train up people who
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the culture they don't have
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
the training they don't have firearms
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're readily available that they use
 
05:09:23.690 --> 05:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
every day and now they have to scramble
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
to Sprint these people to be ready
 
05:09:28.970 --> 05:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
to fight a war that they're not ready
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
for that here there's hobbyists there's
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
individuals like that go out on weekends
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
and they train with arms like this
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
country could never be invaded in such a
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
way that like Ukraine is we it is not
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
possible there's no force on this planet
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
like the civilian populace here is
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
stronger than a lot of armies on this
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
entire planet the United States could
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
never be invaded in such a way
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why I vote itl Mr chairman
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
would be possible would the member yield
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
to a question yes yes go ahead thank you
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you I thank the member
 
05:10:03.288 --> 05:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
you talk about Ukraine being disarm
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
decades ago you of course realize that
 
05:10:07.490 --> 05:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
was the Russians that disarmed them it's
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
still bad and it's now invading that
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
country oh yeah it's so bad it
 
05:10:15.288 --> 05:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean But the irony is
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
well I don't even mention the irony
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty obvious but I thank
 
05:10:19.730 --> 05:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
the member for taking my yeah absolutely
 
05:10:23.448 --> 05:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
it's the who who did it is to me it's
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's a moot point because one government
 
05:10:26.690 --> 05:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
or another government coming in and
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
saying you can't own arms it's in the
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
history of like more than just Ukraine
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at like the Soviet Union you
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
look at China like these areas they're
 
05:10:37.610 --> 05:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
they were disarmed before Mass genocide
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's step one to genocide is disarm the
 
05:10:40.440 --> 05:10:43.368 align:start position:0%
it's step one to genocide is disarm the
populace

05:10:43.368 --> 05:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
and in an exact session I encourage
 
05:10:48.170 --> 05:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
people to do what just happened if you
 
05:10:49.610 --> 05:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
want a clarification want to make a
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
point uh please ask to do what
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sherlock just did and
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
asked directly uh Finney you seconded
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
the motion do you have do you want to
 
05:11:00.110 --> 05:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't know I could
 
05:11:02.520 --> 05:11:03.410 align:start position:0%
I didn't know I could
um

05:11:03.410 --> 05:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's pretty clear that the
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment isn't about hunting we
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
all know that it's about uh the the idea
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
of individual sovereignty protecting
 
05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
ourselves against tyranny and I know
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a lofty thing that you
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably hear and it's a political you
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
know term that gets thrown around a lot
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a serious thing and you know
 
05:11:22.128 --> 05:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
and especially here in
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
um in this state where where we believe
 
05:11:27.230 --> 05:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
in our own individual power as a state
 
05:11:30.650 --> 05:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
and and then and as an individual body
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's important that we maintain the
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
right to defend ourselves in our
 
05:11:37.368 --> 05:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
property and other people and I will say
 
05:11:40.850 --> 05:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally that during that that
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
time there were people that were that
 
05:11:46.190 --> 05:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
had had come up to Manchester to do the
 
05:11:48.650 --> 05:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
exact same thing was was to loot and
 
05:11:48.660 --> 05:11:49.670 align:start position:0%
exact same thing was was to loot and
riot

05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
riot
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:11:55.368 --> 05:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
I I took it upon myself and a couple of
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
my friends to go there with arms to
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
defend the businesses but also to defend
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the people's right to protest
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
and if we don't
 
05:12:06.530 --> 05:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
have that right in this country with
 
05:12:08.570 --> 05:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
arms to make the people that have power
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
over us
 
05:12:12.350 --> 05:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know second guess what their next
 
05:12:13.930 --> 05:12:13.940 align:start position:0%
move would be
 
05:12:16.490 --> 05:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
look we're we're talking about what
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
these guns do and don't do
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
these these guns have the same
 
05:12:23.448 --> 05:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
functionality no matter what they look
 
05:12:25.490 --> 05:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
like and I think a lot of what people
 
05:12:28.010 --> 05:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
are afraid of is how they look but like
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know terms you know military style
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
is is is funny to me because those of us
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
who have been in the military we all
 
05:12:34.798 --> 05:12:35.868 align:start position:0%
who have been in the military we all
know

05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:12:38.930 --> 05:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
that you know that it's the same
 
05:12:40.550 --> 05:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
function as what you get in a civilian
 
05:12:40.560 --> 05:12:41.510 align:start position:0%
function as what you get in a civilian
gun

05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
gun
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
and if if we're trying to say as a state
 
05:12:47.930 --> 05:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
to urge Congress to ban these things
 
05:12:49.550 --> 05:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it's an ignorance on our part
 
05:12:51.948 --> 05:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of people who came to
 
05:12:53.330 --> 05:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
this committee and didn't even know what
 
05:12:55.490 --> 05:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
their terms meant they don't know what
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
high capacity means that's a buzzword
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
that means doesn't mean anything it's
 
05:13:02.090 --> 05:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
not how it works
 
05:13:03.770 --> 05:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so if people are are going to come
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
here and and you know tell us to tell
 
05:13:07.250 --> 05:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
Congress to ban things they should
 
05:13:08.330 --> 05:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
probably know what they're talking about
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
first we should know what we're talking
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
about if we're trying to say to people
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the right to own
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
something because of X Y and Z it's not
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
our role as a government to do that it's
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's antithetical to what we signed
 
05:13:24.288 --> 05:13:24.298 align:start position:0%
up to defend we sworn all to the
 
05:13:26.930 --> 05:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution and enacting
 
05:13:29.208 --> 05:13:29.218 align:start position:0%
a bill or
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know whatever you know and you know
 
05:13:32.520 --> 05:13:33.230 align:start position:0%
you know whatever you know and you know
somebody

05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
um excuse me an HR or an HCR is you know
 
05:13:39.170 --> 05:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
and I was effectively saying that we
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe in the oath that we swore
 
05:13:43.490 --> 05:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
to I think that's wrong and I I you know
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's unethical and immoral we
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh Rollins has a hand
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
up and then representative Smith did
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I remember back
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
when I was in high school uh that's when
 
05:14:02.810 --> 05:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
the first thing I was handgun control
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
came out and then I watched the sales of
 
05:14:08.810 --> 05:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
handguns explode a few years after that
 
05:14:11.570 --> 05:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh I got married I went to work for
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
Sturm Ruger firearms incorporation for
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
27 years
 
05:14:18.410 --> 05:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
and our sales depended on who was
 
05:14:18.420 --> 05:14:19.490 align:start position:0%
and our sales depended on who was
president

05:14:19.490 --> 05:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
president
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
when there was a Democratic president
 
05:14:23.690 --> 05:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they were pushing for gun control
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
the sales went through the roof the
 
05:14:28.368 --> 05:14:28.378 align:start position:0%
overtime was all you wanted
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
when a republican came in control
 
05:14:34.730 --> 05:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
then the sales dropped to nothing okay
 
05:14:38.208 --> 05:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
they dropped flat I remember
 
05:14:38.218 --> 05:14:39.110 align:start position:0%
they dropped flat I remember
um

05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:42.770 --> 05:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
at one point when they when the um many
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
14s that we made semi-automatic rifles
 
05:14:49.250 --> 05:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
it was so dead that we had like 50 60
 
05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
000 in stock and we couldn't sell them
 
05:14:54.288 --> 05:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
then another president came along
 
05:14:56.090 --> 05:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
Democratic president came along and said
 
05:14:58.730 --> 05:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
I'm banning all semi-automatic weapons
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
it only took a month to two months to be
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
able to box those guns up into sell
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
those guns and to put them on the market
 
05:15:07.850 --> 05:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
the line had been dead they were trying
 
05:15:09.890 --> 05:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
to gear it up they couldn't even gear it
 
05:15:12.410 --> 05:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
up in time before the weapons were gone
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes back and forth from one
 
05:15:16.368 --> 05:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
president to the next if people are
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable that they know that guns are
 
05:15:20.208 --> 05:15:20.218 align:start position:0%
going to be safe then they'll spend
 
05:15:22.250 --> 05:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
money on other things when they're
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
worried that they'll never be able to
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
get another one that's where they buy in
 
05:15:31.010 --> 05:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
Mass so gun control often times just me
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
just magnifies the sale of of all
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
firearms if we would just let people
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
live we wouldn't and never started with
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
gun control in the first place you would
 
05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
not see the mass gun ownership in
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that we have in this
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
country at this time that's all I got to
 
05:15:49.020 --> 05:15:50.270 align:start position:0%
country at this time that's all I got to
say

05:15:50.270 --> 05:15:50.280 align:start position:0%

what representative shurtlove said as
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
well we have a problem in this country
 
05:18:19.128 --> 05:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
um especially with school shootings I
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
have school-aged children they are
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
trained at this point to cower in a
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
corner due to an emergency which is as
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
apparent to hear them describe that
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
process nothing short of horrifying and
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
I also just want to point out
 
05:18:34.730 --> 05:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
um you know as you you know my
 
05:18:36.530 --> 05:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
colleagues were referencing some
 
05:18:38.570 --> 05:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
situations happening within our state of
 
05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and involving guns I want
 
05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
to remind everyone that we as New
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents lost a New Hampshire
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%

05:18:52.610 --> 05:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
health issues and and a history of drug
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
abuse with a house full of ammunition
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
standing on the side of the road firing
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
at every car that drove by eight years
 
05:19:00.410 --> 05:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
old he was killed
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
um so I am I am not one to be in support
 
05:19:02.638 --> 05:19:03.470 align:start position:0%
um so I am I am not one to be in support
of

05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:19:06.288 --> 05:19:06.298 align:start position:0%
um being totally against guns but there
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
there has to be something done these
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
weapons I just don't feel are necessary
 
05:19:13.250 --> 05:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
and we have to do do something
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Neill
 
05:19:16.730 --> 05:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative mastermilla
 
05:19:18.770 --> 05:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I think when the forefathers put the
 
05:19:25.128 --> 05:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment in not in their Wildest
 
05:19:28.190 --> 05:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
Dreams could they have ever imagined the
 
05:19:30.890 --> 05:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
type of Weaponry we have today
 
05:19:34.490 --> 05:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
and if they did I'm sure that they would
 
05:19:36.890 --> 05:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
relegate it to the militia
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cheryl if you might want
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
to hit your light there
 
05:19:48.120 --> 05:19:49.850 align:start position:0%
to hit your light there
other

05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:19:53.570 --> 05:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh representative Seibert
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to say that I'm not in
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment I think things
 
05:20:02.570 --> 05:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
that were brought up about like the
 
05:20:04.490 --> 05:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War and things like that
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
is when you know people arm themselves
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
they were not these types of weapons so
 
05:20:13.490 --> 05:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
well no it says representative you
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
should you need to ask if the
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative would like to take a
 
05:20:22.368 --> 05:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
question before you for you before you I
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
hate to say fire before you before you
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
shoot off a question
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
um but but do you represent will you
 
05:20:32.810 --> 05:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
take a question for something would you
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
believe that the Second Amendment says
 
05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
arms not what kind of arms but it says
 
05:20:39.170 --> 05:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
arms and it specifically says arms
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
because they understood that that
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
technology would change over time that
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
the technology has changed but again
 
05:20:49.970 --> 05:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's people who use terms incorrectly
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
who don't know what these terms mean
 
05:20:53.448 --> 05:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
that are saying that these things are
 
05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
happening and
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of people who die from gun
 
05:20:59.330 --> 05:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
deaths is actually under a hundred
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
thousand a year and yet obesity kills a
 
05:21:03.170 --> 05:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people a year and yet
 
05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
we don't ban you know all the fast food
 
05:21:07.490 --> 05:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
places that are on every corner that are
 
05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
killing people every year but so this is
 
05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
a highly charged topic uh because it's
 
05:21:15.368 --> 05:21:15.378 align:start position:0%
become a you know a political football
 
05:21:18.350 --> 05:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
but we have to to you know to examine it
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
as a policy issue that the policy is
 
05:21:23.690 --> 05:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
that that the government cannot ban
 
05:21:25.550 --> 05:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
something that is already protected in
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
05:21:26.940 --> 05:21:28.090 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
is

05:21:28.090 --> 05:21:28.100 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
the bottom line may ask the member a
 
05:21:33.410 --> 05:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
question will you take a question I'll
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
take one more question and I'm done
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
talking no my only question is you told
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
us about the Second Amendment and if
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
that was what's before us right now I
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
totally agree the Second Amendment is
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
very open and I think this uh
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings but we aren't talking
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
about the Second Amendment we're talking
 
05:21:53.448 --> 05:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
about the resolution before us now to
 
05:21:55.930 --> 05:21:55.940 align:start position:0%
ban assault weapons and large capacity
 
05:21:58.250 --> 05:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
magazines that's what's before this
 
05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
committee not the Second Amendment but
 
05:22:02.930 --> 05:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
if we do that I do believe right but if
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
we do that it's in direct
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath every amendment to
 
05:22:09.170 --> 05:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
the Constitution is what we swore to
 
05:22:10.970 --> 05:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
protect not and we don't get to pick and
 
05:22:10.980 --> 05:22:12.890 align:start position:0%
protect not and we don't get to pick and
choose

what this bill proposes the idea of the
 
05:25:40.730 --> 05:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
Marshall Plan that we know what it did
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
for Europe after World War II or brought
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
that back we have impoverished areas of
 
05:25:47.208 --> 05:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
our country that could use something
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
like the Marshall Plan to get them back
 
05:25:52.550 --> 05:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
to work and to improve their lives and
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
to improve their infrastructure and so
 
05:25:57.170 --> 05:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the motion
 
05:25:58.970 --> 05:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shirtleff
 
05:26:04.368 --> 05:26:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
my old uh police academy buddy
 
05:26:08.638 --> 05:26:10.250 align:start position:0%
my old uh police academy buddy
uh

05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:11.810 --> 05:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything that you're
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
saying about improving the life and the
 
05:26:17.050 --> 05:26:17.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of this country however
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
however how can we do that when we have
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
an open border people are coming in
 
05:26:26.990 --> 05:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
using up all our resources that could be
 
05:26:29.448 --> 05:26:29.458 align:start position:0%
used for some of this stuff and until we
 
05:26:31.010 --> 05:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
close the border
 
05:26:33.770 --> 05:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
and address those issues then I don't
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
think this is necessary because we don't
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%

05:28:12.050 --> 05:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
that the rest of us aren't willing to do
 
05:28:12.060 --> 05:28:14.090 align:start position:0%
that the rest of us aren't willing to do
and

05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any relationship and
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help me between this
 
05:28:25.930 --> 05:28:25.940 align:start position:0%
attempt to say Let's help those people
 
05:28:29.270 --> 05:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
who need help to achieve the American
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
dream and your suggestion that the
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
problem has to do with
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:43.090 --> 05:28:43.100 align:start position:0%
yes in part I totally
 
05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
agree I I I totally believe that a lot
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
of our funds are being used up by people
 
05:28:53.330 --> 05:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
coming in illegally look I'm an
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
immigrant my parents came from Canada we
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
were turned away the Border because my
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
parents held up they waited and their
 
05:29:02.990 --> 05:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
visas ran out the Visas ran out so we
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
had to go back to Quebec City
 
05:29:07.490 --> 05:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
and reapply for our Visas so we could
 
05:29:10.730 --> 05:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
come in here legally and we got we got
 
05:29:12.890 --> 05:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
jobs we started working
 
05:29:15.530 --> 05:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
I was six years old when I came here but
 
05:29:18.530 --> 05:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
I do I do remember going through the
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.730 --> 05:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
so if not I am not opposed to Legal
 
05:29:25.740 --> 05:29:27.650 align:start position:0%
so if not I am not opposed to Legal
immigration

05:29:27.650 --> 05:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
I am
 
05:29:32.570 --> 05:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
opposed to people coming in here it's an
 
05:29:32.580 --> 05:29:33.948 align:start position:0%
opposed to people coming in here it's an
invasion

05:29:33.948 --> 05:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
invasion
 
05:29:36.430 --> 05:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
being put on buses being put on planes
 
05:29:40.250 --> 05:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
living in hotel rooms on the dime of the
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I have a problem with that and
 
05:29:44.810 --> 05:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
until that is addressed I don't think
 
05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
the Marshall Plan would work even if it
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
was put into place
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
okay I need I think I need to point out
 
05:29:52.368 --> 05:29:52.378 align:start position:0%
we're getting into an immigration
 
05:29:55.610 --> 05:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
discussion here in the the most the uh
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
measure uh does not mention immigration
 
05:30:02.570 --> 05:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh per se although uh I understand how
 
05:30:04.128 --> 05:30:04.138 align:start position:0%
how it's being pulled into the
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and that's uh and that's
 
05:30:08.570 --> 05:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
05:30:08.580 --> 05:30:09.470 align:start position:0%
that's okay
um

05:30:09.470 --> 05:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:15.770 --> 05:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
yes I would be in favor of this bill I
 
05:30:22.368 --> 05:30:22.378 align:start position:0%
think we are woefully unprepared for the
 
05:30:22.378 --> 05:30:23.330 align:start position:0%
think we are woefully unprepared for the
future

05:30:23.330 --> 05:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:30:27.288 --> 05:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
uh climate change it is uh
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
we need to start investing now
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe that you know we already
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
benefited from a domestic version of the
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
Marshall Plan in the post-war period
 
05:30:39.948 --> 05:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
when there was a tremendous amount of
 
05:30:42.288 --> 05:30:42.298 align:start position:0%
federal investment in building our
 
05:30:42.298 --> 05:30:43.970 align:start position:0%
federal investment in building our
infrastructure

05:30:43.970 --> 05:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:30:46.850 --> 05:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
but that was over 50 years ago
 
05:30:49.610 --> 05:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh and it's all crumbling and needs to
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
be rebuilt and there's we can't do this
 
05:30:54.050 --> 05:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
state by state this needs to be a
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
federal project and we need to start
 
05:30:56.638 --> 05:30:58.010 align:start position:0%
federal project and we need to start
planning

05:30:58.010 --> 05:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
planning
 
05:31:00.110 --> 05:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
on a massive scale
 
05:31:04.490 --> 05:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
and it has nothing to do with immigrants
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative LaMontagne
 
05:31:07.970 --> 05:31:07.980 align:start position:0%

definitely reflect um
 
05:31:19.970 --> 05:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
one of the statements that just was said
 
05:31:22.250 --> 05:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I think that you know for
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
any business owner investor in the room
 
05:31:27.410 --> 05:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you see when you put
 
05:31:29.330 --> 05:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
something into something as an
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
investment you get returned back for
 
05:31:31.138 --> 05:31:31.970 align:start position:0%
investment you get returned back for
that

05:31:31.970 --> 05:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:36.350 --> 05:31:36.360 align:start position:0%

IES thank you Mr chair
 
05:34:38.690 --> 05:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things New Hampshire is
 
05:34:40.250 --> 05:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
kind of premature
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
tell Department I mean to District of
 
05:34:46.610 --> 05:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
Columbia to uh either go to statehood I
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be basically up
 
05:34:51.890 --> 05:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
to them to make their own decisions and
 
05:34:54.890 --> 05:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
doing things like that down there we've
 
05:34:57.470 --> 05:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
had representative C said that they
 
05:35:02.090 --> 05:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
should join Maryland I mean you know
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh I think representative C uh
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they should cooperate uh
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
I mean join Maryland and uh in in
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
becoming able to vote in the the
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
elections and things like that so
 
05:35:21.288 --> 05:35:21.298 align:start position:0%
it's basically it
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm intrigued that your suggestion
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the District of Columbia should
 
05:35:52.128 --> 05:35:52.138 align:start position:0%
um ask to join
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
um another state and give up their
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
independence there have been lots of
 
05:36:01.610 --> 05:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been expressed in
 
05:36:04.490 --> 05:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
many Arenas about the fact that New
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is so small and Vermont is so
 
05:36:13.330 --> 05:36:13.340 align:start position:0%
small and yet we each have two senators
 
05:36:16.490 --> 05:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
whereas States like California and Texas
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
and Florida each also have two senators
 
05:36:22.550 --> 05:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
so would you think it would be good idea
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and Vermont to become
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
one state and have only two senators in
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
order to equal equal that and in which
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
is basically what you're asking DC and
 
05:36:38.030 --> 05:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
Maryland to do thank you very much uh no
 
05:36:40.208 --> 05:36:40.218 align:start position:0%
I was just actually repeating the
 
05:36:42.170 --> 05:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
statements from from one of the
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
representatives that testified on
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
joining and I use that as an example but
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
basically I resort to my original
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
statement of having the District of
 
05:36:54.958 --> 05:36:56.948 align:start position:0%
statement of having the District of
Columbia

05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
Columbia
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
go for their own uh statehood I mean
 
05:37:03.050 --> 05:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
those are the people that that are that
 
05:37:06.170 --> 05:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
are there they they should do that if
 
05:37:10.010 --> 05:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I think you might know
 
05:37:16.010 --> 05:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative pamandi that the citizens
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
of the District of Columbia have been
 
05:37:22.490 --> 05:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
trying for many many years to achieve
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
statehood they vote on it
 
05:37:27.770 --> 05:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
um Whenever there is an appropriate
 
05:37:30.770 --> 05:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
election where they can vote on it they
 
05:37:33.410 --> 05:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
make they State their claim and they
 
05:37:37.970 --> 05:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
speak to the representatives of the uh
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
U.S Congress so they're doing everything
 
05:37:43.490 --> 05:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
that they can they can't make that
 
05:37:46.010 --> 05:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
decision by themselves it has to be made
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
by the country as a whole and that's why
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been asked as every
 
05:37:56.690 --> 05:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
other state has been asked to recognize
 
05:37:59.628 --> 05:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
that if they are in this country they
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
have a right to be represented in the
 
05:38:02.638 --> 05:38:03.708 align:start position:0%
have a right to be represented in the
Congress

05:38:03.708 --> 05:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
05:38:07.010 --> 05:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
well thank I I feel also elections have
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
consequences okay if they tried harder
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
to tried hard to do this they should try
 
05:38:15.650 --> 05:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
harder if they want the statehood
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's just my represent Messer Miller
 
05:38:19.250 --> 05:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
has a hand up
 
05:38:21.770 --> 05:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to support what um
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said and also I
 
05:38:26.090 --> 05:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
concurred with my colleague
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Lundgren and we've had
 
05:38:33.230 --> 05:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
this before the committee before and we
 
05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
did have people from DC come and testify
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:46.850 --> 05:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:38:48.890 --> 05:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to vote against the motion
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief I think it's unfair that
 
05:38:52.550 --> 05:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
when you have a quarter of a million
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
citizens of the United States
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
who a vast majority want statehood and
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
to be represented in in Congress uh
 
05:39:04.010 --> 05:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
the we should do all we can to support
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
their Endeavors and their efforts and so
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the motion to
 
05:39:09.240 --> 05:39:10.788 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the motion to
itl

05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair
 
05:39:15.610 --> 05:39:15.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shirtleff
 
05:39:21.170 --> 05:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:21.180 --> 05:39:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:39:24.890 --> 05:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
I just so just like you know for the
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
body that's okay like I don't know if we
 
05:39:28.128 --> 05:39:28.138 align:start position:0%
ever thought about this during the
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony that that we got for this bill
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
but like why couldn't they have put this
 
05:39:33.470 --> 05:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
on the on the ballot for the federal
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
election has ever been on the ballot
 
05:39:35.458 --> 05:39:38.510 align:start position:0%
election has ever been on the ballot
before

05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.670 --> 05:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's been on the ballot
 
05:39:43.010 --> 05:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we do National
 
05:39:46.128 --> 05:39:46.138 align:start position:0%
referendum son on uh
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
on in a federal election
 
05:39:49.920 --> 05:39:52.368 align:start position:0%
on in a federal election
okay

05:39:52.368 --> 05:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
represent Manion
 
05:39:54.480 --> 05:39:55.128 align:start position:0%
represent Manion
um

05:39:55.128 --> 05:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:56.750 --> 05:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty
 
05:39:58.310 --> 05:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
why would she watching with history but
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly it was Virginia
 
05:40:03.050 --> 05:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
and Maryland both donated
 
05:40:06.170 --> 05:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
the land for the use of DC with the
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
explicit purpose of it not belonging to
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
a specific State because they didn't
 
05:40:12.530 --> 05:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
want one state to have overwhelming
 
05:40:15.288 --> 05:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
power if those individuals that live in
 
05:40:17.810 --> 05:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
the residential areas of DC would like
 
05:40:19.970 --> 05:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
to be part of a state I do like the idea
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
of returning it to what the state who
 
05:40:24.170 --> 05:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
which uh donated it
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes I can tell you that originally the
 
05:40:29.690 --> 05:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
federal district that became known as a
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
district of Columbia was taking land
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
from both Maryland and Virginia if you
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
look at the map uh you'll notice that
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
all the land in the district is north of
 
05:40:41.530 --> 05:40:41.540 align:start position:0%
the Potomac so Virginia
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh ended up keeping their what's now
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
Arlington and Alexandria is part of
 
05:40:49.310 --> 05:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia so they pull that out of the
 
05:40:50.890 --> 05:40:50.900 align:start position:0%
federal district
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
but the land that came from Maryland is
 
05:40:57.650 --> 05:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
still is what does now make up District
 
05:41:00.170 --> 05:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
of Columbia
 
05:41:04.430 --> 05:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith can I I'm going to
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
ask permission to ask you a a tough
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
question if if you'll allow me
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
oh dear of course I'll allow you Mr
 
05:41:18.410 --> 05:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
chair I would never say no well we're
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
here to talk about these things and let
 
05:41:22.510 --> 05:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
me ask you this
 
05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
you may or may not know about 90 percent
 
05:41:27.770 --> 05:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
of the voters in the district vote for
 
05:41:30.288 --> 05:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
one party approximately 90 percent might
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
even be higher than 90 percent
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
um would you look at this differently if
 
05:41:38.208 --> 05:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
if the 90 percent of the voters voted
 
05:41:41.208 --> 05:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I think that's a perfectly
 
05:41:47.090 --> 05:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate question to ask and I would
 
05:41:49.730 --> 05:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
say I don't look at it differently I
 
05:41:52.368 --> 05:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
would still feel the same way because I
 
05:41:55.250 --> 05:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
feel that every citizen of this country
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
should have a right to be represented in
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
in Congress and to show you how
 
05:42:06.650 --> 05:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
how much to do to document the um
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
Integrity of my answer I would point out
 
05:42:14.090 --> 05:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
to you that I have for three years and
 
05:42:16.730 --> 05:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
one of our colleagues can can testify to
 
05:42:20.810 --> 05:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
this been the prime sponsor on creating
 
05:42:24.288 --> 05:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
an independent redistricting commission
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
here in this state because I do not
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
think that we should create systems that
 
05:42:37.368 --> 05:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
favor one party or the other and at the
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of this process actually the
 
05:42:43.330 --> 05:42:43.340 align:start position:0%
incumbent Governor supported my proposal
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
and then he was asked by the uh uh the
 
05:42:51.770 --> 05:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
then head of the Republican
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
redistricting organization not to
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
support it because he wanted to make
 
05:42:59.170 --> 05:42:59.180 align:start position:0%
sure that the state of New Hampshire
 
05:43:03.708 --> 05:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
favored Republicans in redistricting I
 
05:43:05.868 --> 05:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
believe if the Democrats had been in
 
05:43:08.448 --> 05:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
charge the Democratic governor would
 
05:43:11.330 --> 05:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
likely have opposed redistricting
 
05:43:13.970 --> 05:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
because the Democratic governor would
 
05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
have wanted to continue to have
 
05:43:19.610 --> 05:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
favoritism to the Democrats I however
 
05:43:22.368 --> 05:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
and you asked the question of me believe
 
05:43:25.610 --> 05:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
as strongly as possible that we should
 
05:43:29.110 --> 05:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
not be making decisions based on Party
 
05:43:33.010 --> 05:43:33.020 align:start position:0%
Loyalty and I've demonstrated that and
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
will my my colleague to the left support
 
05:43:39.708 --> 05:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that I've done that
 
05:43:39.718 --> 05:43:42.170 align:start position:0%
the fact that I've done that
no

05:43:42.170 --> 05:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:43:43.970 --> 05:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
will you take a question Russell
 
05:43:43.980 --> 05:43:46.090 align:start position:0%
will you take a question Russell
McDonald

05:43:46.090 --> 05:43:46.100 align:start position:0%
McDonald
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%

committee with representative Smith and
 
05:43:58.250 --> 05:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
and she did support an independent
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission and she also
 
05:44:02.270 --> 05:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
supported legislation in front of the
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
election lock committee which I was on
 
05:44:06.410 --> 05:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
last term to that effect so she is she
 
05:44:09.530 --> 05:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
is accurate when she's saying thank you
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith for
 
05:44:13.128 --> 05:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
taking my question I do want to make one
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
more comment with regard to uh
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative manion's uh question
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
about the the district
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
and uh we we actually had a hearing on
 
05:44:27.530 --> 05:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
this measure in reps Hall before the big
 
05:44:31.368 --> 05:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
HC HCR one hearing and I remember
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
and I I spoke I won't say who I spoke to
 
05:44:36.970 --> 05:44:36.980 align:start position:0%
but I spoke to a very senior veteran
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
legislator who came up with what I
 
05:44:43.730 --> 05:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
thought was a a wonderful suggestion he
 
05:44:45.530 --> 05:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
he what I had which I had never heard
 
05:44:48.250 --> 05:44:48.260 align:start position:0%
before he suggested just taking the uh
 
05:44:50.208 --> 05:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
Congressional buildings in the White
 
05:44:52.730 --> 05:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
House and and the uh Department of
 
05:44:55.250 --> 05:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
Commerce and creating a federal district
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
of like a couple square miles where
 
05:45:01.128 --> 05:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
where the business takes place and
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
having the residential parts of DC will
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
revert to Maryland is is what happened
 
05:45:07.490 --> 05:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
with Virginia
 
05:45:09.110 --> 05:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
this would mean that Maryland would
 
05:45:10.270 --> 05:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
probably get at least one more
 
05:45:13.128 --> 05:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative these people would would
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
then no longer be subject to taxational
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
representation I never heard of that but
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
I thought that was I thought it was
 
05:45:22.010 --> 05:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
brilliant and I'm going to keep keep
 
05:45:24.048 --> 05:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
that file away but it's not part of this
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
measure but uh to your point about the
 
05:45:29.448 --> 05:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
the shape of the district and that type
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
05:45:33.288 --> 05:45:33.298 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative gagne
 
05:47:59.448 --> 05:47:59.458 align:start position:0%
representative Charlotte would you care
 
05:48:02.090 --> 05:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
to speak to your emotion just briefly uh
 
05:48:04.610 --> 05:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
we had some wonderful uh testimony
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
including the friend that's with us
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
today from Laconia and the fact that
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico has been part of the United
 
05:48:12.650 --> 05:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
States since the Spanish-American War
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
the United States wanted it to provide
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
coal for ships going through the Panama
 
05:48:20.448 --> 05:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
Canal and for the defensive reasons and
 
05:48:22.010 --> 05:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that the
 
05:48:25.330 --> 05:48:25.340 align:start position:0%
the Commonwealth has not been able to
 
05:48:28.610 --> 05:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
self-determine its own future
 
05:48:30.830 --> 05:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I think this idea of not allowing
 
05:48:32.330 --> 05:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
them to have a public site to vote
 
05:48:35.448 --> 05:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
statehood uh Independence or the main
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
part of a commonwealth with with the
 
05:48:39.890 --> 05:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
mainland us is a shame and it's
 
05:48:42.048 --> 05:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
something I know that's very passionate
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
among the people of Puerto Rico it's
 
05:48:46.128 --> 05:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
actually divisive in elections for
 
05:48:48.770 --> 05:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
governor and for their representative uh
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
in Washington uh but I think it's they
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
should be able to self-determine the
 
05:48:57.530 --> 05:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
future of that Island
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
it is not 1898 it's now 2023 and we
 
05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%

05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
I I don't I haven't had a chance to talk
 
05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
to the uh ranking member about any of
 
05:51:22.010 --> 05:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
them I don't see us representative of
 
05:51:23.090 --> 05:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
the five we heard this morning I think
 
05:51:25.850 --> 05:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
we need time to process
 
05:51:28.368 --> 05:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
I would agree with the chair on that so
 
05:51:30.170 --> 05:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
that leaves us just one bill then and
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's HB 269 we have an amendment to it
 
05:51:36.170 --> 05:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone who does not have a
 
05:51:39.410 --> 05:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
so I what I would like to do here uh
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
here's the situation with HB 269 uh
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
relative to The Authority of New
 
05:51:50.510 --> 05:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire delegates to
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh to be sent to policy making
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
conventions that's very much related I
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
think to HB 392 which we're going to
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
exec next Friday week from today
 
05:52:05.530 --> 05:52:05.540 align:start position:0%
relative to Constitutional Convention
 
05:52:08.330 --> 05:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
procedures for delegates now one of the
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasons uh and not everybody was here
 
05:52:15.288 --> 05:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
all day for the uh for the earlier
 
05:52:15.298 --> 05:52:16.730 align:start position:0%
all day for the uh for the earlier
testimony

05:52:16.730 --> 05:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
on HB 392 but it was pointed out that
 
05:52:21.770 --> 05:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
these that these two measures are are
 
05:52:21.780 --> 05:52:23.208 align:start position:0%
these that these two measures are are
similar

05:52:23.208 --> 05:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the question came up is would is
 
05:52:29.090 --> 05:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
there conflict between the language
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
between the two measures where in other
 
05:52:34.250 --> 05:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
words if if one were to pass would it
 
05:52:37.150 --> 05:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
negate the other one or vice versa
 
05:52:39.650 --> 05:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
which accounts for this amendment being
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
worked up so what I would like to do
 
05:52:44.208 --> 05:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
what I what I'm going to do is I'm going
 
05:52:44.218 --> 05:52:45.650 align:start position:0%
what I what I'm going to do is I'm going
to

05:52:45.650 --> 05:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
push off the exact session on HB 269 to
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
give everyone a chance to review the
 
05:52:53.280 --> 05:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
give everyone a chance to review the
amendment

05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
as well as review both of these measures
 
05:52:59.628 --> 05:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
in in their entirety as they they are
 
05:53:02.570 --> 05:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
related and then we will finish taking
 
05:53:05.570 --> 05:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
that up uh next Friday the 10th and we
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
we do the last of our
 
05:53:10.368 --> 05:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
our executive session
 
05:53:10.378 --> 05:53:11.330 align:start position:0%
our executive session
um

05:53:11.330 --> 05:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:14.330 --> 05:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
measures is there any question on that
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
or on anything else
 
05:53:18.890 --> 05:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith
 
05:53:21.890 --> 05:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
this is just a procedural question
 
05:53:21.900 --> 05:53:22.610 align:start position:0%
this is just a procedural question
um

05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh am I incorrect in saying that after
 
05:53:29.170 --> 05:53:29.180 align:start position:0%
the hearing and in an executive session
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment would have to be brought
 
05:53:35.330 --> 05:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
forward by a member of the committee
 
05:53:38.090 --> 05:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
right yes the question has to do with
 
05:53:39.650 --> 05:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
the amen being introduced by a member of
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
the committee and I believe that was
 
05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Finney are you the one
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
put forth the amendment
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed's name is on
 
05:53:52.910 --> 05:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
there but I didn't I didn't put forth
 
05:53:54.948 --> 05:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I was just the
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay because uh representative Reed
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
that's a good procedural point I my
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
understanding was that representative
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
Finney for the committee uh and against
 
05:54:08.990 --> 05:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know substitutes uh in non-committee
 
05:54:12.530 --> 05:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
members cannot introduce amendments so
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
this was passed out it does have
 
05:54:18.410 --> 05:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Reed's name on it uh so I
 
05:54:21.470 --> 05:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
think I know that for this to be to
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
follow protocol it needs to be
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
introduced by Committee Member such as
 
05:54:28.610 --> 05:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
yourself if if you're willing to uh get
 
05:54:30.890 --> 05:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
with OLS and and have your name in the
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
top of this uh
 
05:54:34.850 --> 05:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
um the only issue is that because of my
 
05:54:36.288 --> 05:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
work commitments I can't be here on the
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
10th anyway
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
right and you've already uh alerted me
 
05:54:41.330 --> 05:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
um so let me ask is there someone else
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
represent Manning okay you you will I'm
 
05:54:49.610 --> 05:54:49.620 align:start position:0%

so if you could get with OLS make sure
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
your name is on on the uh amending uh
 
05:55:00.170 --> 05:55:00.180 align:start position:0%

05:55:03.470 --> 05:55:03.480 align:start position:0%

weeds that was talking a lot about um
 
05:57:05.330 --> 05:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's valid uh concerns about foreign
 
05:57:07.128 --> 05:57:07.138 align:start position:0%

that have these uh energy policies that
 
05:57:14.330 --> 05:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
would just not be kept in in check so we
 
05:57:15.708 --> 05:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
are here uh shooting ourselves in the
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%

with the opioid crisis as well and I
 
05:58:00.288 --> 05:58:00.298 align:start position:0%
think this is the appropriate action
 
05:58:02.208 --> 05:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
that needs to be taken you know we can
 
05:58:03.830 --> 05:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
only control what's what's within our
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
own borders but that doesn't mean we do
 
05:58:05.520 --> 05:58:08.090 align:start position:0%
own borders but that doesn't mean we do
nothing

05:58:08.090 --> 05:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%

Charlotte
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um yeah I'll be
 
05:58:16.368 --> 05:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion I think when
 
05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
we see Rochelle came out with 40 billion
 
05:58:20.868 --> 05:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
dollars the other day in profits a lot
 
05:58:23.090 --> 05:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
of them those profits been made by
 
05:58:25.548 --> 05:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
misinformation to the general public I
 
05:58:27.170 --> 05:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
think the biggest one is what we've
 
05:58:28.730 --> 05:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
learned now with the oil companies have
 
05:58:31.970 --> 05:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
said about uh climate change that in the
 
05:58:34.368 --> 05:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
public who was all the fast can we find
 
05:58:36.410 --> 05:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
out they were more accurate when they
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
their internal predictions was it's far
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
worse than even the government was
 
05:58:43.970 --> 05:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
predicting so think of things like that
 
05:58:46.610 --> 05:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
there should be some uh method
 
05:58:48.590 --> 05:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
methodology if they have them pay for
 
05:58:50.090 --> 05:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
their past ends and I'll be voting
 
05:58:53.090 --> 05:58:53.100 align:start position:0%

the future we need to invest in a green

uh infrastructure and this would be one
 
05:59:14.810 --> 05:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
way to do it without having the
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
