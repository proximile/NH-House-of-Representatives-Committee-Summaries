public hearing on House Bill 1346 and
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
here from the prime sponsor represent
 
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 align:start position:0%
you good morning represented lean
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman I do have a hand out
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
grass

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
so good morning for the record my name
 
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
is Peter Lehman I represent Hillsboro 33
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
Sharon so this item deals with the
 
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
ability of um bed and breakfast to hand
 
00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
out snacks and you'll see in the handout
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
that is coming
 
00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
around the Food Service license for a
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
cranberry metal Farm which is located in
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and I was contacted last
 
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
year by the owner of cranberry Meadow
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
and they were quite concerned that they
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
could not even give out a cookie so I
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
so I scheduled this so for those of you
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
who didn't have your proper breakfast
 
00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
who didn't have your proper breakfast
this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 align:start position:0%
morning there better not be any nuts or
 
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
chairman but seriously uh well again on
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
a side it certainly doesn't violate any
 
00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
ethical guidelines because it's the
 
00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
cookies are worth less than $25 a piece
 
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.270 align:start position:0%
um in
[Music]

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
Peterboro no
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh she can't make them legally and give
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
them out
 
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.550 align:start position:0%
them out
so

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
um so anyway I um told her I'd take the
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
charge to see what we can do about this
 
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 align:start position:0%
because as the owner pointed out they
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
have guests arriving at all hours of the
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon Into the Night and most
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants in the petyo area close up
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
between 8 9 so if you have a guest
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
coming in at 10: or 9:00 she can't
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
legally give them a brownie or a
 
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
sandwich or anything else and it just
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
seems to me that why this is on the
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
books is I don't know but um to me it
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
made no sense in our state where we're
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
trying to improve tourism that we would
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibit as you'll see what
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
the permit conditions are no preps of
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
snacks lunch dinner or catering events
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
and again all she's looking for is the
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
ability to as the Bill calls for provide
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
such a license that shall permit snacks
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
and meals just for the patrons not
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in off the street but
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
people that are staying at the bed and
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
breakfast and with that Mr chairman I
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
done well no you're
 
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.629 align:start position:0%
done well no you're
not

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
you called
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
me did you now I did and I guess I could
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
point out that you suggested a
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
compromise and of eight days or six days
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
to give out snacks I thought we should
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.909 align:start position:0%
 
together

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for the committee
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
members yes thanks for taking my
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
question so I guess I'm confused so I
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
assume that the these bed and breakfasts
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
have are their certified K kitchens for
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
for um serving yes because they serve
 
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
breakfast so so why is it even on the
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
books that they can't do snacks I have
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
no idea it doesn't make any sense to me
 
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
because I think I may have mentioned
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
this to your chairman if there was
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
concern about um the uh waste facilities
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
like a leech field or something uh they
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
could go to a restaurant that was open
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then come back and use the
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
facilities at the bed and breakfast so
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
cuz I had heard from somebody there was
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
some concern maybe it would T over tax
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
leech Fields but nobody really could
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
give me a specific answer why this is on
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
the books okay would you believe this
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee is familiar with this type of
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
issue we've had these bills over the
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
last couple years we've had this issue
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
and that is what we have
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
learned is that there is two kinds of
 
00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
kitchens in this world okay there's some
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
kitchens that are the homeowners happy
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner type kitchen and then there
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
are kitchens that are certified to
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
prepare meals and yes it is true that
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature in its wisdom decide to
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
allow bed and breakfast is to use that
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
happy homeowner
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
kitchen but it limited it only to
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
breakfast and what you're coming back in
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
and says is no that's not good
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
enough it should be able to have the
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
full kitchen that we allow for
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
restaurants so it's not just the leech
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
field because uh yes it is true if
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're in a community that doesn't have
 
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
Town sewer you would have to have a
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
special leech field that's got a
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
trap and we've learned about that in
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
this committee okay about that trap and
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we've also learned okay is that it
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
needs to have more sinks than you would
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
think four because you not only have the
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
three sinks for doing the washing the
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
dishes you have to have a special
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
sink for whopping in the floors and and
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's where this particular constituent
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
because I did talk to her as you asked
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
me to and she what she was missing was a
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
the leech field with a trap and B she
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
didn't have the
 
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
didn't have the
extra

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
mop to clean sink well it's a followup
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking or we're looking uh the
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors this bill so someone could
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
actually get a cookie or a snack this
 
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't a full prepared meal that um you
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
know would require three sinks but if
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
someone she went out and bought the
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
cookies for instance I just presented to
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
you she can't legally under her permit
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
even give out a cookie so I think that's
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
a real
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
stretch okay all right thank you sir
 
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony any other
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
questions to the committee seeing none
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
chair will call up Colleen Smith who
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
you'll notice her name is down here on
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
here and Colleen will tell you where
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
Colleen she wrote it I know but yes she
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
know she's absolutely familiar with
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with what it
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
but I would like to provide some
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
information about the bed and breakfast
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
license so we do H license bed and
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
breakfast they are allowed to have it is
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
intended that it's the inkeeper home so
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's a residential kitchen with a
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
Residential Refrigerator a typical
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen sink um it's allowed
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
to have access to family members pets
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be removed um from food
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
preparation areas when someone's making
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
food but it is there's no septic
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
requirements we don't do a floor plan um
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
review as we would a a regular
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen for a restaurant so
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
they do have limited requirements um we
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
were contacted by chairman hunt several
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
months ago about making some allow
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
allowance for a snack to be served under
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
consideration that some areas where bed
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and breakfast is are located are en
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
rural communities which might not have
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants open at 9:00 p.m. for a late
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
night guest and so we did um propose a
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
change in our administrative rules to
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
allow for the service of a snack five
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
times a month for late arriving guests
 
00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0%
times a month for late arriving guests
um

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
so those administrative rules are due to
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
go before doar on the middle of February
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
with that change in mind Our concern
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
about the the bill as written is that it
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
it calls for meals and there's no
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
limitation if we put meals in statute
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
there would be no limitations so a bed
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
and breakfast could do um C they could
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a wedding on site where there would
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
we would be subject to a lot larger
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
quantities that maybe this residential
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen wouldn't be suited to handle
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
safely so our concern about that term
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
meals is there's no um boundaries on
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
that or limits as to what someone could
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
do um the concern that was brought up
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
about cookies so we do allow Homestead
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
food operations and they can do baked
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
goods in their home um so that would be
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
something that this it this facility
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to do is offer uh it
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's something that's allowed not only
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
for bed and breakfast but anyone that
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
has a home Kitchen in our jurisdiction
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
is allowed to do direct a consumer sales
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
without a food license so that and
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
that's limited to things like cookies
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
brownies things that don't require
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
refrigeration for
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
safety uh if I if there are any
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee from the
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be happy to take
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
those yes
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you with take my question so
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
you just said um cookies five five times
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
five times a month or five times a no
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
she's saying cookies anytime no but
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
cookies in any time no before before
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
that statement you made a statement
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
about F five days um so so the snack we
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
didn't put any um limit we didn't put
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
any context around what a snack could be
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
so it could be something like a s
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
sandwich that c that currently isn't
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
allowed is other meals besides breakfast
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
aren't currently allowed under the
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
current Rule and
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
statute so uh just a follow for the
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
question follow the homestead um act I
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
mean they they can bake cookies there do
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
they need a homestead
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
a licensed to do Homestead cooking so
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
there are so most homesteads are exempt
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
from a license that do um direct a
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
consumer sales and they also are allowed
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
to even sell at retail stores without a
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
license the only time they need a
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
license for us and again they they're
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a residential home
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
kitchen is if they want to sell via the
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
Internet or to restaurants where there's
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that direct to Consumer
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
interface so so just yeah just another
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
followup so it doesn't seem like there's
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
a problem if they yeah would you believe
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
I I if there was unclarity around this
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular licy you know we'd happy be
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
happy to reach back out till say that
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
they currently even before our rule
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
changed which would allow them to make
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
something like a sandwich they they're
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
not they're not restricted to offering
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
baked goods that's something that's
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
allowed in other instances so we
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
wouldn't so there there's no dollar am
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
amount limit on this on the bigs some
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
reason I remember there was some Bill
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
that had a $10,000 Li last session the
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
dollar amount was was um taken away soed
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so there there's no longer a dollar
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
limit on what a homestead can make right
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of weird because you
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
know a Double Tree they give me a cookie
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that a bed
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
and breakfast can give
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
cookies okay any other questions yes
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
represent pelli thank you clarification
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that um if we
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated the word meal from this bill
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
would we still need it or snacks are
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
statute so we we have a proposing rule
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
to frame up a limit on the the snacks so
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
I I would say if you are going to put it
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
in statute maybe we would may need to
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
have and there's no limit on it maybe
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
some clarity around what a snack is is
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to you know play ahead and
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what the disposition of this
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
next step would be so there seems to be
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
a question about meal yeah the next step
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
is that is the rule now because you sent
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
me that your letter on did you send that
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
to all the members or did I I'm the only
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
one who got that I I just passed out
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
copies of the written testimony that
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
includes our language that will be in
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
the so includes what's the language of
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
the of the rule right so this is this is
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
when I called her earlier and I I've
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
been some of you might know about we're
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep eye on Ru making and I
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
watch it every month to see when this
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
rule hearing was coming up and and and
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
finally saw that it did hit that uh this
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
Ru making will be U entered um to and
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
that and this R new rule will then
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
supersede this statement here where it
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
says no sax uh so what you will see is
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper will change the the
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
annual license will change and will
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
state this new rule change that you can
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
have SN up to six snacks per month now
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
obviously nobody's keeping track of that
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not it's just a you know
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
um the point being is don't make a habit
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
of doing it every night don't don't say
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
to your all your guests that we're going
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
to make you sandwiches every night okay
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a it's a oneoff on
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
occasion that you check in and at Peter
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
bro all the restaurants are closed at
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
9:00 so that you can at least get a
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
sandwich from the bed and breakfast
 
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
sandwich from the bed and breakfast
facility

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
okay I thought we had this problem
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
solved but evidently represent leash
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
so okay and represent
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
grassie yes uh thank you um this thing
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
about limiting the snacks to five times
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
a month or six times a month whatever it
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
is I I really have a problem that maybe
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have to provide a definition for
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
we have to provide a definition for
snacks

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
snacks
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
and if you could come up with with some
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
sort of definition for that because I
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
think that you know I don't see a
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
problem with them providing snacks
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
anytime uh throughout the month and you
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
know you could have a a bed and
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
breakfast that you know or it could be a
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
a house with the Brady Bunch living in
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
it you're probably going to have as many
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
meals and being quite familiar with
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant Services as well most of what
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
I think they're looking to propose I
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
mean there may be some stuff here that
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
weddings and and other events that may
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
be a problem but you know you don't
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
really need a grease trap from making a
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
BLT or uh making you know there's a lot
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
of bacon greas very well it all depends
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
on how you do it maybe I pick the wrong
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
one but making a peanut butter and jelly
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
sandwich you don't need a grease strap
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
for um you know and I don't see them
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
making Ian as I said they could be the
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
Brady Bunch you make grease trap you you
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
make BLTs for all the kids in that
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
family it's it's going to be fine in the
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
septic system um you know as long as
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
they not looking at a professional
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
kitchen here I don't see a problem with
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
this and I think that you know we should
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
I would support having no restriction on
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
snacks um assuming that a snack was only
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
a cold cut sandwich that could be
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
something that it could be something
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is not a cooked meal or maybe
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to look at have some
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
sort of definition for or a pre
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
pre-prepare prepared thing that they
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
could bring in from offsite where all
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing is disposing of the waste
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
preprepared would be is not an issue
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
here right pre prepare would be is
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely you can go get that the issue
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
with that case is whether they're
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
so but that if that obviously a any
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
hotel guest uh or bed breakfast guest if
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
they brought food in from somewhere else
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
then you know that's that's not what's
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
in question here the question was they
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
show up at at
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
9:30 and said you know we missed dinner
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
can is there anything you could do to
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
help us yeah if they had like a a sub
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
sandwich or something that so what
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for is a definition of
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
that snack of a snack so that we can
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
make it unlimited because I think if you
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
you put five in or you put a number in
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's unenforceable well the five and six
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
is really that the intent on that is not
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
so much to what about the snack itself
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
that was intent is not the person not
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
the bed and breakfast to do it
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
routinely but I don't see a problem with
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
that I understand you don't but the
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
problem was that the legislature in its
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
wisdom so if you want to put this to
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
study we can talk about but in its
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
wisdom it decided that to H be a
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant MH okay not you know and
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
because remember this was a the the
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
breakfast wasn't was an exception to the
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
rule that the legislature passed and its
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
wisdom to be nice to bed and breakfast
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
is but that the rule always been and and
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
we would have Hospitality to come in
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association to say to them
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't start saying oh bed and breakfast
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
is are now even exempt from the
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
restaurant requirements
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
oh yeah right then they're going to be
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
very upset they're going to come and
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
argue with wait a second now you make us
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
put these traps in you make us have
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
these extra sinks and you make us do
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
these things and you're going to let the
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
the bed breakfast to get away with it
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
and have catering events with 200 people
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
right I understand that okay I
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
understand that and I and I will and I
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
will see this at jel car next month as
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
well because
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
iard so what you're asking for is to
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
have a definition of snacks yeah okay is
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
that possible sure you know we we were
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
just trying to fra frame it so that it
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
was limited so that it wouldn't go to
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
the extent of you know they have a a
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
late night menu now and that it becomes
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
it it starts to grow or or again it can
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
be a wedding event that that now it it
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
things seem to morph on their own so we
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
were just trying to have some language
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
that would frame it up and limit it so
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
that it was just to accommodate a late
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
arriving guest to without um you know
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
being undue being reasonable that there
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
is no other solution for them to go out
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
and get a a meal in the
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
area any othere yes refes M um thank you
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I I could see somebody showing up at
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh on Friday afternoon and asking for
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
something to eat and and the proprietor
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
is saying well I already handed out five
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
Snickers bars I can't give you anything
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh as per per event as opposed to
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
numbering it uh how about the term
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
occasional snack that seems to me to to
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
fit the the bill and people can figure
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
out what occasional means but I don't
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
think any the devil's in the details
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
you uh okay any other
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh I had
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
one one more card left Dan Maguire who I
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
assume is a
 
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.710 align:start position:0%
assume is a
co-sponsor

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
yep he
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
is not thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dan Maguire I
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom and yes I'm
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill um and it's
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's very simple I I'm someone who uh
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
patronizes bed and breakfast I don't
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
know once a year once every other year
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
something like that and I would think it
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
super strange whether they're in New
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or elsewhere if they did not
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
have snacks right I mean it's very very
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
common that a bed and breakfast will
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
have uh a cuing coffee maker a um plate
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
of cookies uh a cheese and crackers
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
maybe at 4:00 you know maybe even wine
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
at 4:00 you know stuff like that no all
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
right well it's very common whether it's
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
allowed are not allowed because they
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
probably are a restaurant license they
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
probably have the restaurant
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
license some of them do I doubt it but
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
anyways um some of them are very small
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
right some of them are ordinary homes
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have weird kitchens and all
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
this sort of stuff so so personally now
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
at at the previous public hearing I was
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
in this morning representative Smith
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
cautioned me on the benefits of uh
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
compromise and so I would be happy if on
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
line four you removed and
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
meals and just put snacks right and and
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
because it's very common to have like I
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
said simple snacks
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
crackers chips whatever um and and and
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
if I went to a bed and breakfast that
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have that I would somehow think
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's not not as good right I mean it's
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
just it's just that that's how common it
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
is now um this question about late meals
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
I don't personally think that makes any
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
sense because um when I travel I think
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
about what meals am I having right I
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
mean I I I keep in mind well I'm going
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
to be here at such and such a time I'm
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
going to be there at such and such a
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
time I don't expect if I arrived at a at
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
a hotel or a bed and breakfast at 9:00
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there's going to make
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
meals for me I mean that that doesn't
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me so
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think you need to go that that
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
far I think the simple bill without the
 
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:33.909 align:start position:0%
far I think the simple bill without the
an

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
meals uh let the let the department put
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
the definition of snacks into
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
rules that's the end of the story right
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
I mean very
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
simple fair enough thank
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%

an Enterprise agency or

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
increase and the commission would run
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
fully developed and implemented or
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
implementated an internal audit function
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the size and compl
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
lexity of its
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
operation back on August 26
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
2016 in a division one work session on
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 406 FN
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Danielson offered an
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to repeal the liquor
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
fund representative Smith said it best
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
and I quote the Enterprise fund was to
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
improve Revenue but those goals have not
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
been achieved at the same work session
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Chuck Moore said the Liquor
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
Commission needs more time due to
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
competition I am not sure the long-term
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
Sol what the long-term solution is
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
Perhaps it is time to privatize liquor
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire as so many other
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
states have
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
done one could argue that revenues are
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
off due to competition Co or a number of
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
other factors
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
however if you look at the recent New
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery Commission as an
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
example I'll see attached their revenues
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
in f23 are up 12.4% or $66
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
million with an increased transfer of
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
29% or 43 million to the education trust
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
fund one more troubling aspect
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
concerning Liquor Commission is it is
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
not uncommon to receive a letter or a
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
phone call call from someone claiming to
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
be an employee of the Liquor Commission
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
with a serious
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
complaint the last letter I received is
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
attached and was forwarded to the
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
justice department for review finally Mr
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I know that you are the goto
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
guy see attached when it comes to liquor
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking forward to a healthy
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
debate regarding the Liquor Commission
 
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.190 align:start position:0%
debate regarding the Liquor Commission
going

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward now I would like to add there's
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
been a lot of uh emails and phone calls
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
back and forth that I've received over
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days where people
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
thought the bill called for the removal
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the governor's Commission on alcohol
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
abuse that is not true
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
um uh is somebody also as far as Granite
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
State Advantage there was some current
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh concern expressed that this was also
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
going to be eliminated but as one of the
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsors of both bills that
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
brought us the New Hampshire Health
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
protection plan initially and the
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
granite state advantage that couldn't be
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
further from the truth I do have an
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chairman um based on my
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with Kate fry several
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
weeks back at new Futures uh concerning
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and as you know the
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
um money to take care of the state
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
portion comes out of the net proceeds or
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
the profits um from The Liquor
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
Commission and what the amendments
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
specifically does is move that to the
 
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.870 align:start position:0%
specifically does is move that to the
liquor

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
commissions um gross revenues versus net
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
profits as U Miss fry pointed out
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's is a feeling in the legislature
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
that this money should not come from
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
General funds and something like the
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but those of us very
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with the funding aspect of this
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
know that any money that doesn't go to
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
the uh net profits of the Liquor
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
Commission does doesn't go to the
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
general fund so the grab is done before
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
it goes to the general fund so it's
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
still State money but it would be coming
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
out of the liquor fund versus the
 
00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:06.069 align:start position:0%
out of the liquor fund versus the
general

00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
fund so I think that's all I have to
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
testify and certainly would welcome any
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:15.470 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
chairman

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative Barz thanks for
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you familiar with
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the uh drinking Trends in the United
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
States and what direction those are
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
going in they are going going down can I
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
follow up further question main question
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
would you believe that part of that
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
decrease is due to the drinking cits of
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
Millennials are going way down and
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're going from an average of four to
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
three drinks um a year and so liquor
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
sales are off across the country I do
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
know that is correct and uh marijuana
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
sales are up I was just going to say and
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
and uh I was going to say there's people
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
going across the border now to get the
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
Cannabis so they're not drinking as
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
much of course it is maybe they're
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
buying their booze in Massachusetts
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they were already heading down
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
there to buy their
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
spirit thank you so I went I went online
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
and I looked at what the liquor fund
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
does and one of the things it does is it
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
it looks for Grants from the federal
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
government to help with uh counteracting
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse and that sort of thing so
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
my question is if we we don't are you
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
intending to just get rid of the fund or
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
are you intending to move it seems like
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
being able to get federal grants to
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
support this kind of activity is very
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
useful we're not suggesting it just goes
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
away are we oh absolutely not prior to
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
2009 and uh thank you for your question
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
um The Liquor Commission basically had
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
to get permission from the state
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
treasurer for spending now they have
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that authority to do that without great
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
oversight as you know um the problem is
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
that with sales going down liquor sales
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
Nationwide as representative Burl stated
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
um the liquor fund for supporting uh
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
Granite advantage and the alcohol fund
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
the funds available may be reduced or
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
have been reduced you'll see one of the
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
attachments it shows the amount of money
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
has been reduced to the um New Hampshire
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire Advantage but the um
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advanced funds that are
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
required and the alcohol funds
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
especially at the alcohol funds have
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
been reduced excuse
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
me but there would be no impact on any
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
bill okay so not withstanding I've got a
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
pile of cards here if everybody's all
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
freaked out that you're the pitchforks I
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
was told were out today so assuming that
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
we make it clear to everybody that that
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
was not your intent with this bill it's
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
clearly not in the bill and the bill
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't take effect several people
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
called me and said this is going to
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
happen this year and I said if you look
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
at the Bill's effective date is July of
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
25 the next bium budget so it's possible
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
that whether the governor or the finance
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee could say that um the alcohol
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
fund should be funded with General funds
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
and I would specifically support that
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
because looking at 5% you don't know
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
what that could be it's been it's going
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
to decline because of decreasing
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
revenues and perhaps um it should be 6%
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
or of set number in the budget so that
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
would be funded with General funds so
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
you're saying that theoretically um
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
passing this bill might mean that the
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
the uh they will get more money I would
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
hope so okay is it
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
so their concern should not not be about
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
what the less money I would it let's sck
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
to what the purpose of this bill is okay
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is that when
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature made the decision to
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
change the nature of the Liquor
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
Commission so that it wasn't uh let's
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
put it for better or worse micromanaged
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
by legislators through the budgetary
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
process that as a member of the finance
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
committee you guys certainly feel that
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
it was a failed experiment to do this
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
and that the commission is not running
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
efficiently and that you think that you
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the finance committee can be more e you
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
can ensure that it is a more efficient
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
operation if you took over and
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
micromanaged its budget I don't think
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
knowing my colleagues would micromanage
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
but let me respond to what happened in
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
2009 I was on the committee of
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
conference when this came up it came up
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night it was
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
offered by then state senator Hassen to
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
make the liquor fund into an Enterprise
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund there was no public hearing there
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
was no public hearing Mr
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and I regret what was done
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
because it was late often things get
 
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
introduced late you've been on hundreds
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
of Committees of conference not
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
everything is done out in the open if
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
you will and uh we passed on July 17th
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
on that Amendment um to make the Liquor
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
Commission a special fund and there was
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
no public hearing before your committee
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
or anybody else it was offered by the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
Senate during the committee of
 
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.549 align:start position:0%
Senate during the committee of
conference

00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:47.559 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations um obviously I uh my memory
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
is uh uh in terms of whether the
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
committee actually had had a hearing I
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
do not remember that so but I do
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
remember the conversation about why we
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
were doing it and the thrust of doing it
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
was that it made more sense that we
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
treat The Liquor Commission as a profit
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
Center as a business and so therefore uh
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
the example I remember U and I'm trying
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
to remember who was who said it but it
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
was um someone from uh the department
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
was talking about how um if if a car
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
crashed through the window of a liquor
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
store you remember that story that's the
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
example in the Liquor Commission at the
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
time said they would probably have to
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
wait a week before they got
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
authorization replace Council had to
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
approve the uh replacement of the window
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
so if you remember me that there was
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
some kind of discussion about why we
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
were doing this that that certainly
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like there was a some kind of
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing we did know what we were
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
doing were wide open at that point in my
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
recollection there was no public hearing
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
there was discussion among people about
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get a window fixed and
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps that was done in the hall but
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
there was no public hearing this was
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
introduced at a committee of conference
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay best of my knowledge best and it
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
probably was house build too it was okay
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
which we all know is is a place where
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
non gerain he bills can get stuck in
 
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.950 align:start position:0%
non gerain he bills can get stuck in
willy-nilly

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess I wanted do here's my point
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
to you okay not withstanding that I know
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
I'm holding all these people back who
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
are just ready to stick their pitchforks
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
in you and which you have tried your
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
best to assure them that that was not
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
your intent I'm just trying to get at
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
your real intent is that you want to
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
bring the Liquor Commission back in to
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund and have the finance
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee I assume you're going to need
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
a new division for it because it must be
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
rather busy to look at through all the
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that that department does that you
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
think you can better manage it that the
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
state would be better managed if we
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have as an independent fund that
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
we had it in the general fund just like
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
other departments like Health and Human
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
Services I don't know if I can say it
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
managed uh as you know the finance
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee my division that I chair uh
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
meets for six weeks to review many
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
dozens of budgets and branches of
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
government billions of dollars is in six
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
weeks all I've asked for and the chair
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
knows it's not the first time I've been
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee with concerns with
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is that they
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
law you know the deposits are made
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
monthly versus daily the treasur office
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
has been trying to negotiate to get the
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
money they owe the drug agency over a
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars to get that settled you
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
know if those issues were settled Mr
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I probably wouldn't be here but
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
I've been on the fiscal committee long
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
time and if I look at their audits and I
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation I don't want to say
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
anymore but I'm not I'm not very
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
disappointed I'm I'm not alone I've got
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
a number of sponsors on this bill that
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
serve on the finance committee uh we
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
just like them to follow the rules just
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%

question is this your handout that is
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
mine yeah I'm still waiting for my
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony that they said it's
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
frozen in the computer upstairs perhaps
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
the chair had something to do with that
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
but oh followup why do people put these
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
pow follow up further question main
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
question uh the last three pages of this
 
00:48:59.319 --> 00:49:01.589 align:start position:0%
question uh the last three pages of this
handout

00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh what's the
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
relevance well that was a complaints um
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
members that are sitting behind me have
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
gotten phone calls complaints when I get
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
a complaint unfortunately the complaints
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
that whether I've got them or other
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
members uh people are afraid to put
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
their names to them I there's a miles
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
that I deal with at the Attorney
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
General's office and he said until the
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
complaints people put their names on
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
there's not much we can do but we don't
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
get complaints from anybody else and I
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
know that probably doesn't act say as a
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good example but that's why that
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
is just just an example of one of the
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
written complaints that someone went to
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
the trouble of to send to my home in
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
Peter I don't the last page is a letter
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
with no author that's how I said people
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
are afraid to put their names on them
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
that so it's hard to act but we do get
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
those complaints sir and final you
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
already had a
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
final over over the last week we've

chairman once again Dan Maguire from
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
Epsom yes I am the vice chair of
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
division one of finance and another
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
member of our uh division is
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative Grassley grassy who's
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
also part of your committee um so I'm in
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill for the purpose Pur
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
for the reason that I'm against
 
00:50:57.559 --> 00:50:58.710 align:start position:0%
for the reason that I'm against
automatic

00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
spending right the the um the this um
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
treatment fund gets this automatic 5%
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
from the liquor fund it goes up and down
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
um based on whatever the liquor fund
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
happens to do and it and there's no
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
thought behind is that the right amount
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
to spend is that the wrong amount to
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
spend should we spending more should we
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
spending less what we do on the finance
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee is we have we sift through
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
request for funds from from thousands
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
and thousands of different angles and we
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize and we figure out should
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
should we spend on this how much how
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
does it compare to that and so on that's
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
our job and so when there's automatic
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
spending like this it h it makes things
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
more diff difficult for us because if we
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
wanted first of all there's a little bit
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
of an out of sight out of mind kind of
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
aspect that's why this is done because
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
people who want this don't want close
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on on what they're doing
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
generally speaking and um so so things
 
00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
that don't directly affect the general
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
fund get less scrutiny from us than
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
others right and so
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
what the What that particular fund
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
should do is it should be part of the
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
normal division three process where they
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
decide how much funds go to Medicaid how
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
much funds go to recovery how much funds
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
go to this that and the other thing
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
right and and it should be balanced
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
against all the other requests that we
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
get now it could be when maybe the the
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
consumption of liquor is going down but
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
the problems with drugs are going up
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
and this fund needs extra money right I
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
mean um it's just I'm I'm against this
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
kind of automatic spending and it's it's
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
riddled throughout the budget quite
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
frankly I mean this is one little piece
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
I mean this doesn't solve the whole
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
problem it's one little thing but why
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
not fix this now while it's in front of
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
us an example I had in the budget just
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
recently was the affordable housing fund
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
right we when there are three different
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
affordable housing funds and when that
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
came to our committee we have to decide
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
are we putting 10 million here and 15
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
million there and 20 million there what
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
are we doing with this well it turns out
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of these particular affordable
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
housing funds gets an automatic 5
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
million from um uh I think it's the real
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax right off the top
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
and we don't see that right it's it's
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's we see okay how much General funds
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
am I using for this that and the other
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
thing and so we don't that's not part of
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
our thinking when it's automatic like
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's and I only discovered
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
that just recently because the Senate
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
has a bill to it tank the five million
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
and make it 10 million so you know um so
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
anyways the point of that
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
is let's have normal
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
oversight over these kind of funds
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
including The Liquor Commission and one
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
more thing I'll say this your example
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
about the broken window Etc I don't I
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that's realistic right we
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
had a case this this last time with the
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
um Department of Corrections and the
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections wanted um a small uh amount
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
of of spending Authority so that she
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
could reward guards who performed above
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
and beyond the the Call of Duty right
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
that that um give them a present give
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
them a little party give them a
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
something when they do something good
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
and so we did that right we're not we're
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
open to when when Commissioners come
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
before us and they say I need a little
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
spending Authority for such and such a
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
purpose right like the broken window or
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
whatever we give we give that right I
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
mean it's
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's not something where we we have
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
to you know I don't get a list of well I
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
bought a I I bought a typewriter
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
ribbon if such a thing still exists
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
right and we approve it I mean we don't
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
do that sort of stuff we budget right
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
and this will give this much oversight
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
over an area that has been problematic
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
time okay uh representative Gibbs has a
 
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
time okay uh representative Gibbs has a
question

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and thank you for
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
testifying this morning um isn't it
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
possible that what you've described uh
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
as automatic funding uh isn't it
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
possible that there are some programs uh
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps important programs that need
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
consistency of funding uh in order to be
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
able to plan and operate in a consistent
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
Manner and that that is the reason why
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
there are specific allocations of
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
percentages or dollar amounts so that
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
the those programs are not subject to
 
00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
the those programs are not subject to
bial

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
uncertainty yeah I I guess I don't agree
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I
 
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.309 align:start position:0%
I mean I
think

00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
there's having they get certainty every
 
00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:47.270 align:start position:0%
there's having they get certainty every
two

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
years in general we don't eliminate
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
anything but we adjust right we we push
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
a little this way or that way
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
um now there are certain funds there are
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
certain dedicated funds that are there
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
for constitutional reasons like the
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
highway fund for example right so the
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution says Highway funds can't be
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
intermingled with General funds right so
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
we that we do that right there there's
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
other similar things but in this case
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
consideration represent ma later uh
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um as as a previous
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh was previously said by another
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative is that there seems to be
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
a misconception as to what this bill
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
does and I've got a lot of emails as
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else do had saying let's itl
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
this because they're going to totally
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
discontinue the alcohol fund what went
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
wrong there and how can you correct that
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
perception yeah I think it's as
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman said the effective
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
date of this bill is the same date as
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
the new budget starts
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
s right so um the new budget will start
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
on July 1st
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
2025 right a a year and a half from now
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
so that's when the next budget will will
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
take place so knowing that that alcohol
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
and and Drug fund will not be
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
automatically um funded this way the
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
department that runs it will come to
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
finance and put it in their budget
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
they'll put it in their budget it'll be
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
a line I'm in in the budget it'll be a 5
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
minute or 10 however long discussion
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
when when division three looks at that
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
budget right so it's not going to be dis
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's not disappearing it's just the
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
automatic nature of it is is what's
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
disappearing you
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
see okay thank you very much thank um is
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I don't see her
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think she had to leave for her
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
own committing okay and then normally we
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
next person up would be former
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative Ned G and I see he's no
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
longer in the room uh he is opposed to
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed so I assume he
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
would be uh focusing on the same issue
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
that everybody else is focusing on so
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
now we'll get into all the opposition to
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and so all I can ask is uh
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
please when you your testimony of here
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
that that the sponsor did not mean that
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
to discontinue These funds but I can see
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
that the argument of the guaranteeing
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts versus the flexibility
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee might change
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
those things and every banum is a POS is
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
a possibility so uh Rob Barry and
 
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
a possibility so uh Rob Barry and
David

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
David
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
Ernie uh d David had to step out but I
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
do have Daniel Higgins with me and
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Higgins great um so we did Mark
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
oh for the record Rob Barry general
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
counsel Division of Medicaid for New
 
01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.549 align:start position:0%
counsel Division of Medicaid for New
Hampshire

01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS I'm Jenny O Higgins legislatively
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
aison for Behavioral Health with DHHS uh
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
so to respect uh the committee and and
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
your point Mr chairman we're not going
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
to belabor anything that U our testimony
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
was primarily centered on the bill is
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
introduced uh I did understand from
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman that our concerns
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
at least as far as the granted Advantage
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
piece uh may be addressed an amendment I
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
look forward to reviewing that language
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and working with the sponsor on
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
that but our our biggest concern was how
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh the conversion of the liquor fund to
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
General funds May upend the grant
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program which is statutorily
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
prohibited from utilizing General funds
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
and that's all I'll have to say about
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
that so additionally from the behavioral
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
health perspective the the portion of
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
the revenue that funds the governor's
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
commission um does allow for flexibility
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
where we have many Grant restrictions
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
and so in New Hampshire where our
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
funding sources for the substance use
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care often rely on federal
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
grants with two-year Cycles the
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
stability and predictability of this
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh allows for us to do more
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
long-term planning and consistency in
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
that Service delivery and also there is
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
a specific and really valuable tie to
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
being the sole owner and operator of all
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
liquor stores and then coupled with our
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility of running the substance
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
use disorder Continuum of Care that we
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
really bear an obligation to reinvest
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
that Revenue into prevention treatment
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
and Recovery to mitigate harm to our
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
communities so the you know data linking
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol to societal costs and harm is
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and alcohol continues to be
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
one of the most commonly misused
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
substances so that is a very specific
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
linkage to those revenues coming back
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
harm okay so the rationale of having
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
connected to this liquor fund rather
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
than the general funds is is important
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of why we have this both to
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
mitigate harm as well as the flexibility
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
that it allows for how the funds are
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
used and are directed by the governor's
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
commission which has a strategic plan
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
forward and obligates these These funds
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
on based on very specific need in New
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how they invest great
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
thanks oh we do r b thank you for taking
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
my question uh the federal funds that
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um did do they need
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
a match from no so just the federal
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
funds often have restrictions including
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're very substance
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
specific like our opioid Grant dollars
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
need to be used only for opioid and
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
stimulant use disorders so this funding
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
source allows for some flexibility to
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
really look at how do we invest in New
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire across our Continuum of Care
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
and for people who may have poly
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you okay
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
um before I go on i' just been a text
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
that evidently the governor has signed
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet uh in opposition to this
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
bill and then I will have Patrick tus
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the governor's
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
death do I look like a
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
villager I'll be great
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
yeah hit the microphone hit the hit the
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
button there you go perfect thank you Mr
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
chairman committee members I'll be brief
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that I did have a
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
leechman and I really respect the intent
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
of what he's trying to do which is to um
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
guarantee more funds to help people
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with substance use disorder in
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we share that
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
concern um I am opposed and the
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
governor's commission is opposed to the
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
bill as written because the lack of
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
guarantees as to how we would fund the
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous work that the governor's
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
commission is doing um I've heard uh
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
automated uh brought up um we need
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
predictability in order to do the work
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
that we're doing um I really
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
congratulate the legislators here in New
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for fully funding the
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission in this bium it is
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
the first time we have been fully funded
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
and the transparency and the outcomes of
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
the work that we're able to do is
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
included in this report and plan uh the
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire benefits greatly
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Governor's
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
you have assembled a tremendous amount
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
of content experts who are able to make
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
decisions and support the Department of
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to do
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
tremendous work that is flexible and
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
extremely relevant and also very local
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um we are a able
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
to invest in and determine local
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
strategies that are in real time to what
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're facing here in our state that
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
aren't tied to Federal Regulations so I
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
won't belabor the point um I respect the
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
intent I am concerned about what this
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
would mean for the predictability of the
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
very important work that we do in the
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire because I would
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
replace the word automated with
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
predictability and in order to do good
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%

predictability so Mr chairman committee

on the board of that
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
organization that provides drug and
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol treatment it's a rehab in
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
Dover um you would like me to be short I
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
intend to be so short as to defer my
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
remarks to the executive director of
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
this organization who sits behind me um
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
but I definitely am opposed to this bill
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm very much in favor of what
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature did to in the year 2000
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
to establish an alcohol fund for the
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and prevention of this Scourge
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'm going to uh step
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
aside but I hope that you will consider
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
a letter I've written and my comments
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
that this is an important uh piece of
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now the alcohol fund and
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
it should be continued
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and it hasn't been funded properly in
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
my opinion until recently thank you for
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%

Hampshire alcohol and drug abuse
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
services and I'm speaking in opposition
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
to the uh bill as written um thank you
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
for your time and thank you for
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
listening to me um yes I am the
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
executive director of a uh Treatment
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
Facility in DOA New Hampshire and uh the
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
points that have already been raised
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
very well this morning uh are absolutely
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
true we are at times hamstrung by
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions on federal funding and we
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
are reliant on consistent funding levels
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
to continue off operating the services
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
that we provide um alcohol use disorder
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
is a huge problem it remains a huge
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem we still will see a significant
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
number of people for whom alcohol is
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
their primary or sole drug of choice and
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
in order to treat those individuals we
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
require funds that are generally
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
applicable so my concern with the bill
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
as written is in paragraph 3 where it
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
specifies a portion of the gross profits
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
that establishes no flaw for this
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
funding level and that is my concern
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
there a portion is far too
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
ambiguous thank you okay any questions
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
the the Committee Member seeing none
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh chair
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
good or good morning still right good
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
morning it's been a long morning um
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Kate
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
fry I'm the vice president of advocacy
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
at new Futures I will be very brief I
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
have testimony in front of you we are
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 1702 while I
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
respect where representative lman is
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
coming from as well we did want to um
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
point out the unintended consequences um
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
as you know we are a nonprofit
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization that work
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
um on policy change with policy maker
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and others to reduce
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug problems in the
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
state so just to clarify as uh you've
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably heard while it repeals the
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission fund and makes the
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
oversight of Liquor Commission funding
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bill also REM removes the
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
requirement for the state treasur to
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
credit all gross revenue from the sale
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
of alcohol to The Liquor Commission fund
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
and directs it to De be deposit in the
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
Jenner fund just to clear new Futures
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on the
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of the funding struction for
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission um or uh
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
um exactly sorry however new future
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
strongly opposes the portion of the bill
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
which removes the 5% requirement of
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
gross profits from alcohol sales to be
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
deposited into the alcohol abuse uh
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment fund otherwise
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
known as the alcohol fund and instead
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
directs the legislature to set an amount
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
based on appropriation included in the
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
state operating budget using general
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
funds so while it doesn't repeal the
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund it does get rid of the 5%
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
and that's very important to us for
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
background purposes Finance through the
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
revenues generated from the liquor sales
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the alcohol abuse and
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
treatment fund was established in 2000
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the creation of the
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
fund was that a small very small portion
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
of gross profits 5% of substantial
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
revenues generated by the sale of
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol would be used for prevention
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery and administrated
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the governor's Commission on
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug as you heard from
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
Patrick tus so for context 5% of gross
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
Prof uh profits it's a drop in the
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
bucket compared to what um the revenue
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
is so in 2021 10.3 million was 5%
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
compared to the 81 million for revenues
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
although the alcohol fund is an innov
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
ative fiscally responsible Common Sense
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
approach to a very real need in New
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since its exception the fund
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
has been historically underfunded and
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
diverted elsewhere it was not until last
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
year 20 years later that the fund was
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
actually fully funded at the amount of
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
5% in the state's operating budget for
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
24 and
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
25 so this bill reverses that historical
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
by removing that requirement of 5% of
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
gross profits and just leaves up to the
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and amount based on the
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation included in the state
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget so we all know from 20
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
years of history and you have a chart in
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
your um pocket uh this appropriation
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
will likely be far below the
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
5% um so as said earlier it would also
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
just Dr up the funding structure for
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion there is a
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in the granite Health
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage law of the use of General
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
funds so now if a portion that used to
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
come out of the Liquor Commission fund
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
comes from General funds that's likely
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
to impact uh the entire Medicaid
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
expansion program which provides Health
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
Care coverage to more than 50,000
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters um so for these reasons
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
we ask you to vote an expedient to
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislate again I brought an alcohol
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
fund chart that shows you fully funded
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
versus what was actually appropriated
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify by the funding
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually increased uh in the past I
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
think you heard earlier that it's
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
decreased over there we finally got
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
fully funded uh this year so um we would
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote in expedient to
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
legislate I also have a one-pager on um
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
the abuse fund and the governor's
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
commission and some of the agencies that
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
re uh receive funding and I do want to
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of even though
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
it said this would happen in two years
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
we have to remember the fragility of
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
many of these agencies uh Who deliver
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
this funding so the long-term planning
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
would really be impacted no matter what
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
even if it's in two years we have to be
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
picture Okay um representative Gibbs has
 
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
picture Okay um representative Gibbs has
a

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you um the question I'm
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask is based on my own
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
experience as an agency head dealing
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
with Federal funding and the agreements
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
on which that Federal fund in is often
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
based do you know if any of the federal
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
funds for alcohol abuse programs in New
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh come via agreements that
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
include a provision stating that if the
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
expected consistent funding were to be
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
reduced that would violate the agreement
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
for the federal funding and imperil the
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal funding itself um thank you for
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
the question I believe that is that
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
could happen um I'm not an expert at
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
don't work at the department I do
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
believe that there could be language in
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
there but I do also want to underscore
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
what Miss oh higin said that the alcohol
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
fund because it's not General funds
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
provides tremendous around amount of
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility that can't be used um where
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds has more restrictions so
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
it really is an Innovative fund where
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
you can use um uh where there may be uh
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions where other with other
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
funding thank you very much thank you I
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
arrived good morning good morning Mr
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
name is n Gordon I live in the town of
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
Bristol and I'm not here as a judge
 
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
Bristol and I'm not here as a judge
today

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
so I uh I'm here just uh as I read the
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill I was concerned because
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
it appeared to me that uh it was a
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
repeal of the uh alcohol fund uh that
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
was put in place a long time ago and and
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
I certainly would be opposed to doing
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
that and opposed to changing the funding
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism through the general fund I
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
think that there there should be a tie
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
between the alcohol commission and
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
funding and I think it says a lot about
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of um who we are and
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
value alcohol you know alcohol the
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
initial fund was created because uh it
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
was well recognized that alcohol has a
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
has an effect that our our agency our
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol Commission in the state was
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
established to be a control agency
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
and has evolved over time into a
 
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.350 align:start position:0%
and has evolved over time into a
marketing

01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
agency and because it is there are
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
consequences for marketing alcohol and
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
AR alcohol is recognized although we
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
have the opioid crisis and we have
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
people dying in this state and it
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
becomes uh you know pretty shocking when
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
you have sudden deaths like that but the
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
fact is that alcohol kills any a huge
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
amount a great a greater number over
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
time than drugs do other types of drugs
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
do it's it's a potent killer and that
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we should ban it but I
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
think what we should do our very best
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
job is to control it and uh the one
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
thing about the alcohol fund the alcohol
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
fund was intended to address issues with
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
regard to prevention and education
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
because you can't with regard to Alcohol
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs you just can't treat
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
your way out of that problem treatment
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
isn't the answer prevention and
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
education is the most beneficial way of
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
approaching it so the reason I'm here
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
today is just to say that I would be
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to certainly doing away with the
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund all together but I would
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
also be opposed to doing the funding
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism through the general court and
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh through the general fund I think it
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
should stay linked to the alcohol Comm
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
commission that's the only lier
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
commission that's my only testimony
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
today perfect thank you very much thank
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%

1702 have you as you have um heard um
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
this uh bill would put um the Medicaid
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
expansion program in Jeopardy currently
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law um the program
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
um allows for the use of Liquor
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
Commission funds in the event that under
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
other funding sources are insufficient
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
to fund the program and I have included
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the RSA for your reference and I
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
can um go through that if you would like
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
to show you where it says that um and
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
additionally as you've heard um the
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage um program is
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using any general funds
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
and I have not seen in this bill where
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh it would allow that program to use
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
General funds in the event that other
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
funding sources are insufficient to fund
 
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.870 align:start position:0%
funding sources are insufficient to fund
the

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
program of of all the challenges facing

is

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
Paramount in New Hampshire
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
221,000 adults have a mental health
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
condition and 15,000 minors ages 12 to
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
17 have depression and yes a lot of
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
those folks right now are covered by
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
Commercial Insurance um however at any
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
point in time um somebody can lose their
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
job and if that happens um and granted
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
Advantage wasn't there as a safety net
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
they would be unable to continue their
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Ser the services that they have in place
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
um like other medical illnesses delays
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
in treatment mean progression of serious
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the seriousness of the illness and
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
more difficulty and cost when the person
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
eventually does receive treatment so if
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
there was a gap in their treatment um it
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
would be more severe and more costly in
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
the end um for those living with mental
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
illness these delays can result in
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
outstanding personal and productive
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
losses that harm the livelihoods and
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
life-threatening in 2021 of the adults
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who did not receive
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care nearly 42% didn't
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
receive it because they couldn't afford
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
it and this bill as it's written um if
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
they lost their insurance that's more
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
folks that would not be able to afford
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
their care we also know that in our in
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
states that have expanded um Medicaid
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
more children are end up being covered
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
by Insurance just by happen stance the
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
research bears that out so um it also
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
would affect the kiddos um in the state
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
that are covered by Insurance the
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
positive impact of grite granite
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage um
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
has an improving access to care is
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
obvious in
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
2021 through the Medicaid expansion
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
program over 11,000 Unique Individuals
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
received mental health outpatient
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
services nearly 830 accessed in patient
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization and over
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
26,500 obtained mental health
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
medication um so you know Nami New
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire applauds the current success
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
of the granted Advantage program and the
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
legislators who have supported that
 
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.950 align:start position:0%
legislators who have supported that
program

01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
um however House Bill 1702 could put all
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that work in Jeopardy and therefore we
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
do oppose this bill and I'll take any
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
has I think we're questioned out thank
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%

organization you gota push the
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%

01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
recovery centers in do Rochester and
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%

01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um as well as a social
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
as a restaurant in summersworth New
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
and I I want to speak in opposition to
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
this bill um I appreciate the intent and
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
but I do think that there will be some
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences to it and
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
especially as has been said the
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility so to give a couple examples
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
we have two contracts that come to mind
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
that come through the governor's
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
commission um one is through as a
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
subcontract of What's called the
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
facility ating organization which which
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
funds all of the recovery Community
 
01:23:59.070 --> 01:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
organizations across the state in that
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
funding it's a braided mix of SSA block
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
grant funding State opioid response
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
money that comes from the federal
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
government as well as Governor's
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
commission alcohol
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
funds and that braiding is really
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
important because because there's a lot
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
of activities that we engage in in our
 
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
recovery centers and a lot of programs
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we do that would have restrictions
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
from that SSA money whether it be State
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
opioid response or the SSA block grant
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
that some of those things we just
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do if we didn't have
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
that alcohol fund and we didn't have
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
that money coming from the governor's
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
commission so it's essential for us to
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
do the things we do and we're serving in
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the in our three centers we have over
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
11,000 visits a a year coming into our
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
centers so it's a substantial
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
population um with not a lot of money
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
and then we also run a family support
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
contract across the state which which
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
helps prop up and expand family um
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
support groups which are mutual Aid
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
groups mostly run by volunteers and to
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
build the capacity around that across
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the state that again is also funded
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
through the governor's commission from
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund and again if we didn't
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
have that money the flexibility that we
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
have to work with those volunteers and
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
some of the programs and some of the
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
trainings we do we train them on
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
facilitating we train them on suicide
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
prevention we work with them to build
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
capacity and we just wouldn't have that
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility based on some of the you
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
know quite frankly ridiculous
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions that often come with
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that that tie our hands
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
on a lot of things we do so I just want
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
to stress that flexibility as an
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
organization um and I also want to say
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
you know to the to the point that Kate
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
fry made from new futures um the alcohol
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
fund's been a long around a long time
 
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
I've been in this work since
 
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
2013 I can't think of a bium that I
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have to come in front of the
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
finance committee and beg them not to
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
pull money and divert money out of the
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund as it is so when I hear
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the intent is to provide more
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
funding and put it on a general ledger
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
line item I have concerns about that
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
because we've only been fully funded
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
last year and you know the one year it
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
gets fully funded we're now facing
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
somebody uh legislation to to repeal the
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
entire alcohol fund um so I have a lot
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
of concerns about that but I would
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
welcome the primary sponsor and any
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors that do want to see
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
additional funding to put another
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
additional funding General line item in
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
that General budget in the finance
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
committee we would certainly welcome
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
that and I think most of the agencies
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
that are impacted by the alcohol fund
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
would accept additional funding we
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
certainly could use it so I thank you
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
all for your time and appreciate the
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
good so Jim represents uh by state new
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
Futures ACS Solutions cbhl I but he is
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill I would have
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
to say that Jim is the first person who
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
told me about this crisis this bill was
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for your time
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Kim Bach I'm the executive
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
director with the New Hampshire
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
Coalition of recovery residences and we
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
receive our support and and our ability
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
to operate from the governor's
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
commission um what we do is for the most
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
part we certify voluntarily certify that
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
recovery h Homes across New Hampshire
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
use best practices and are safe ethical
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
places for people in recovery to get
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
their lives back on track
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
there's no licensing requirement for
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
those homes in New Hampshire and that's
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
typical across the United
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
States I think it's really important
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
that there's money guaranteed to go
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
towards this purpose to go towards
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
everything that the Govern Governor's
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
commission supports from from prevention
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
through treatment through recovery
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
Support Services we have National Data
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
that tells us
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
addiction 70% of that is
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol most of the funds as as Jenny
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
suggested most of the funds if we've had
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
mixed funds we have to be really careful
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
about is it just alcohol this person is
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
addicted to or is there other substances
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
because the federal funding is often
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
limited to other substances that's what
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
sells the news that's what is popular
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
right now so alcohol funding is very
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
very very limited but that's still 70%
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the problem the great news is that
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
recovery from
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
addiction it's 80% by recovery that's
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
long-term remission meaning that with
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
all these support services that are
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
offered to people in New Hampshire we
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
can reduce the time to get to sustain
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
recovery from an average of 15 years to
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
an average of five years and their their
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
risk of overdose or
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
of death from their addiction comes back
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
to the same risk as the general
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
population the alcohol fund does really
 
01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.470 align:start position:0%
population the alcohol fund does really
great

01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
work all of us working together provide
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
those services that are very important I
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
understand the bill isn't intended to
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
take away all the funding that there
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
would still be funding there but we also
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
deal with nimbyism and nimbyism is not
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
in my back my backyard and as the
 
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:49.639 align:start position:0%
legislature changes in population ideas
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
change and there's no guarantee that
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
they would have the same
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
priorities to work with people with
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
addiction that that are guaranteed if a
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the funds are put
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
in that direction so I oppose the Bill
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
you uh did I just see Jim walk in or did
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
he walk back out SE in and out okay
 
01:30:13.639 --> 01:30:20.830 align:start position:0%
he walk back out SE in and out okay
Kimberly

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.070 align:start position:0%
 
Haley

01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
Haley
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
hi good morning um so I've been a
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
prevention councelor in the state of New
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since
 
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
1988 so I was here when the alcohol fund
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
um came into
 
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.470 align:start position:0%
um came into
existence

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
and I've also seen the fund not fully
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
funded year after year after year after
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
year um with lots of
 
01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.350 align:start position:0%
year um with lots of
frustration

01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect to the uh
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives who put 1702 together
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
which I oppose um it's it feels more and
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
more the more people up here talking to
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
me it feels more like a little bait and
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
switch um you know the the governor's
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
commission um has a bunch of
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
representatives from the prevention
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery Community who
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
advised the commission on how money
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
spent now these Representatives say no
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
problem okay the alcohol fund's not
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
going away we're just going to let the
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
general fund fiscal people you know
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
handle it you just you just give us your
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
budget and we'll take care of you you
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
know that that's what they're making it
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
sound like that's not the way it's going
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
to go okay because
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
they've barely ever funded the alcohol
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
Fund in full who's to say they put a
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
diamme in for prevention treatment and
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
Recovery you know oh sorry we have these
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
other expenditures you know we we can't
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
help you you know and one of the reasons
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
why it's important that it goes
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
automatically into the fund because it
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
guarantees just something something to
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
work with
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
and um when you're sitting there with
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
with budgets away from the commission
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
these people don't have in their mind
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
who these Cuts you know or lack of
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
funding are going to impact you know you
 
01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
got to ask the people that work in the
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
trenches okay with with the
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
Fallout from um people consuming alcohol
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs okay so the people
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
making these decisions I doubt you have
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
ever sat in the room with a 13-year-old
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
who lives with family substance use who
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
wants to die who's talking about dying
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
because they have no hope for their
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
future okay people working in the
 
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
trenches help that kid through Services
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
figure out why they do have help that
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
their life can be different than the one
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
that they were born into you know I'm
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
not sure these people have ever gone to
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
a prevention program in a school and
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
followed a prevention Council around to
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
see what they really do how do these
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
Services benefit anybody right have they
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
ever gone into a treatment center and
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
talked to some of the clients and what
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting out of these Services
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
have they ever gone to a Recovery Center
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know when they're providing some
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
activity on a Sunday afternoon that's
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
keeping people from using have you ever
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
experienced that so when you're sitting
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
in some room with a pile of money in a
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
general fund you're not going to be
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about these people unless you
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
make the effort to actually
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
go and visit some of these
 
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.510 align:start position:0%
go and visit some of these
programs

01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
um it is incredibly unethical immoral to
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
me that a
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
state receives a pile of money from the
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
sale of a legal
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
drug but we have to
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
battle for people to take responsibility
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
to clean up the mess on Isle
 
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.550 align:start position:0%
to clean up the mess on Isle
five

01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay in the form of
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
addiction okay one in four kids in the
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire lives with a
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
caretaker who has an alcohol
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
disorder one in 11 lives with a
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
caretaker who has another drug
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
disorder okay that's a lot of
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
kids I work as a consultant with
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
prevention counselors
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide and I can tell you these
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
prevention programs are now going down
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
into elementary
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
schools because we have fourth graders
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
bringing alcohol to
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
school and these people want you to
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
think that oh alcohol sales are going
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
down that's a good thing well they're
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
right that's a good thing ask yourself
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
why because people are in the
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
trenches helping
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
people so they either will grow up and
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
not drink until they're in their 20s and
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
avoid addiction or they're helping them
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
get treatment and they're supporting
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
them once they're
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
sober that's
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
why and the time is not now to like oh
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
we we don't have to worry so much okay
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
we've got to adolescent selling drugs on
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
Snapchat fake bills from China that have
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
fentol in them okay this is this is what
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and we're talking
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
about oh don't worry your money will be
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
safe in the general fund no it won't
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's a bait and switch and it's a
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
lie and we'll be lucky to get
 
01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.950 align:start position:0%
lie and we'll be lucky to get
anything

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%

people who are legislators to get out of

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
had a phone call or an email where
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
someone says they want to get rid of the
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
the liquor fund well I would like to
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
respond not to the last speaker but the
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
previous speaker before her and the
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
allegation that we as legislators don't

when I know what it's like that's wrong
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I know that the sponsors want to see
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
more funding and restricting it to 5%
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%

01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
allegation that those people whether
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
your people sitting around the table or

Commerce Committee I'm introducing uh
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1540 for the record my name
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
is Representative Keith Amon from
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
42 I'm a co-sponsor on the
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll just describe briefly what
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
does um it's it changes what restaurants
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
um have to uh
 
01:41:14.719 --> 01:41:16.350 align:start position:0%
um have to uh
provide

01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh adds a new
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
definition there's a list of different
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
types of meals that can be
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
provided um and it changes some of the
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
the guest uh
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
numbers and um adds one or more tables
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
so it reduces the numbers of of tables
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
that can that are
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
required uh and
 
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh the meals should be readily available
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
and served to the table the menu shall
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
contain multiple options of full course
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
meals from at least two different meal
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
categories that are listed and you can
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
see that they start on line
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
six and uh with that um I don't know if
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
I'm qualified to take a whole lot of
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
questions on this and I know there's
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
probably people behind me that uh that
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
will have more detailed answers so but
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'd open up for questions if there are
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
any so what is the intent of the bill uh
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's to um allow for Less uh
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for um I think basically
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
service alcohol right isn't that the
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
idea so um that you had to have
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
um a meal that required table wear that
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
you couldn't eat it standing up like so
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're reducing that and adding
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
different types of meals to it so you
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
could have a salad or a wrap or because
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think what I've heard on this
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the last three plus years
 
01:42:47.229 --> 01:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
is we don't want people drinking alcohol
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
without anything in their
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
stomach and that's really the issue is
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
that it slows the absor absorption rate
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
of alcohol if you have food readily
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
available so I think this new
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
definition um still allows for that you
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
can eat a sandwich you can eat a wrap
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
you can eat a salad um and that meets
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
the requirements so that that's my
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
understanding good any questions from
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
the committee members of represent
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
W thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
question can you just tell me what a
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%

17 line 17 I'm just curious I've never
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
heard of that is that Campbell I can
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
answer that if you'd like it it's a it
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
may be a a regional term that we may not
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
use around here oh like a CH it is from
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah campo's website it is whole
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
bunch of definitions for different types
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
of St stews and soups and I just
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
included all of them in when I was
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%

01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
way okay but you know I was really
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
disappointed when Campbell pulled the
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
pea soup off the market for a while but
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's back now so it's back in and
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that might be a stew because it's
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
got ham and peas thank you very much for

family here so we can be a little bit
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
lighter about this
 
01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right Mike tell us
 
01:44:45.159 --> 01:44:48.750 align:start position:0%
okay all right Mike tell us
why

01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
you you uh took no position on this bill
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh I did not um so good morning Mr
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
the record Mike Summers president CEO
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
Association um we actually uh appreciate
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
the effort to try to Define food this
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
has been somewhat of a struggle over the
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
years um so we're actually okay with
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
that and look forward to working with
 
01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee assuming there going to
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
be a subcommittee of course um where we
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of concern with the
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill is the reduction down to 10 guests
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
at one time uh you know 10 guess is
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
basically a takeout counter frankly so I
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't know that we necessarily want to
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
have a full service restaurant distilled
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
Spirits Etc at a takeout restaurant so
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
again look forward to working with the
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on that and working through
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
those uh and certainly happy to hear
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
where the commission is on all of this
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
so uh that's
 
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.470 align:start position:0%
so uh that's
it

01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
oh I guess you're allowed to ask a
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
question because you
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
didn't testify um now I get it why that
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
Happ would you would you believe
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I actually just
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with the commission and so I think
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
in working committee we're going to
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
actually change that part that you're
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
raising in concern with to the language
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
will read something to the effect of
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
we'll leave the 20 as is unless under
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
discretion by The Liquor Commission and
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
that'll give them freedom to look at it
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
the motivation behind that specific part
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
is there is a restaurant I learned about
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
in the North Conway area that my my
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
brother's a plumber and he was doing
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
Plumbing for them and they didn't even
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
know that his brother was a c rat but
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
they were just venting about how they
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
can't get a full liquor license because
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
they can only put 14 seats in there and
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
he wants to be able to serve like
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
martinis and stuff it's just a cafe
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
higher end I guess so um it just seemed
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
kind of ridiculous to me which is why I
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
put it in there but then the Liquor
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
Commission has a pretty good suggestion
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the language so I imagine we'll
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
we'll adjust it in the working s session
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing the language
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
obviously um but again I I will also say
 
01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
having worked in the restaurant industry
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's awful hard to make it make it in
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
this industry with 15 seats so just for
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
what it's worth but if you have Al yeah
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
but even then I mean 5050 can't have to
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
your alcohol can only be 50% of the
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
revenue just real quick I'm just curious
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
which restaurant it is because it'll
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
give me a visual because I'm from that
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
area no I me understand it better he'll
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
later all right thank you thank you uh
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement you going to come in and
 
01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.109 align:start position:0%
enforcement you going to come in and
tell

01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
us speak to us anyone which way about
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
this one or you going to leave it all up
 
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the record uh Mark armaganian chief
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
of enforcement and Licensing for the
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission with me here today uh
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
is Danielle Elston deputy director and
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
and deputy chief um there have been a
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions on this this and we
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Sullivan and
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
and uh this whole committee on being uh
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
receptive to open conversations on this
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
like we always are um uh the deputy
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
chief who can speak more about this has
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh been very active with conversations
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
with uh representative suvin on this
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
issue um I think we can get
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
someplace um there are there's some
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
things we have to work out and there's
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
some uh there's some verbage that needs
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
to definitely be defined but I think at
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
some point in subcommittee we can get to
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
that point so not to Echo the words of
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
Mike but uh uh I I do Echo uh exactly
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
what he said that I think that there's
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
some good stuff that was brought up and
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
there are some other things that other
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
problems that we have dealt with in this
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
category that we don't want to see arise
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
as an unintended consequence fair enough
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
Danielle you want to say
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%

01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
sheet you didn't know that joining this
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
committee means you had to get up
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
and sit
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:23.950 align:start position:0%
and sit
down

01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative Jonah wheeler sign
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
the failure his next one's his I don't
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
know if he wants me to do it we're we're
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
not there yet we got to gavel this first
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
testify okay this one's yeah so you you
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
will fill out a pin card after
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards yeah thank you all right
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing to
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1374 and you got five minutes
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
no okay yeah so this is two very subtle
 
01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:07.639 align:start position:0%
tweaks to the existing law um one of
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
them is to change and I'm sure I'm going
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
to get Flack for it but anyways we're
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
changing the so the current law for
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know on this on
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
this committee I'm sure many of you do
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
the current law says that if you don't
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
sell $775,000 worth of food in a year
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
then you need to sell 50% of your
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
revenue from food and so I think for
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
those smaller restaurants that don't
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to sell maybe 75,000 a
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
year that's that's a big burden and so I
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
just reduce it down to 15% it doesn't
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
mean that they get rid of their kitchen
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they get rid of serving
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
food of course you still have to get 15%
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
of it it seemed like less of a burden
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
for these smaller cafes particularly
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
when they're in their early startup
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
phases um then the other one which sort
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
of came as more an observation is the
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
idea that that they have to be open 5
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
days a week in order to have be able to
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
sell alcohol I thought that was a bit of
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
a burden and I adjusted it particularly
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
up where I live where a lot of our
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
business is tourism and you start to get
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the slower you know the shoulder
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
Seasons we're talking April May and
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
November a lot of places are really slow
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
and they want to be able to open only 3
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
or 4 days a week not 5 days a week
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
because they just literally can't make
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
money doing it and so we're forcing them
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
to be open when it's not profitable
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
during those slower times of the year um
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
so yes that was the motivation of
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
changing that down to three days a week
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah those those are the basic uh
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
the basic ideas here any
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
burrow this thanks this is a uh would
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
you believe in high tourist areas like
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
like the where we are in the North
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
Country um even some of the big
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants can't stay open 5 days a
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
week because they can't get help and
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
because there's no he housing for
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
workers so I mean I think that's a
 
01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
problem not just for small so I I think
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good point in the bill
 
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.870 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good point in the bill
yeah

01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
thanks would you believe yes okay I know
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
represent M
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
you thanks representative San for
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
bringing this up um on line 14 should it
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
be limited to the evening meal or should
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
meal

01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
meal
 
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.350 align:start position:0%
meal
um

01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that is existing law so I just
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
changed the five to a three so we could
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
change that that's something people are
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about but um that's just I
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
just was trying to minimize the amount
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
of changes to make it a little bit
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
easier to follow do you think it might
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
make it even more flexible if they could
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
you know not not necessarily an evening
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
meal like maybe a Sunday brunch or I
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
mean I love the idea making things more
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
flexible so I'm totally open to
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
that okay so um yes I've been around too
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
long so that 75 was actually reduced at
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
one point in time was all the way up to
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
150 then was 100 and then
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
75 and the idea is that
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to the 50/50 was really
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
the the most important
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
number because that when you get down to
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
that Dom Minimus number if you're just
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
15% and and three days a week that you
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
know this boy that sure of looks like
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
just a bar that's not a
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant when you're doing that low
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a reason why the
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislature has never gone
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
there yeah I I understand the motivation
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's entirely an
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
accurate way to think about it and we
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
certainly can have this discussion in in
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but the way I look at
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
it is there are places that are
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
primarily bars for good chunks of the
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
day already in some places even in the
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
state with that you know you go to
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester downtown places they're
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're open I know there's different
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
licenses I'm not trying to go into that
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
is we're still allowing people to open
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
up establishments that sell w liquor H
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
sorry that can't sell liquor but can
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
sell beer and wine and have not this
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
requirement and so the only what makes
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
that not a bar I know places that are
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
set up this way that feel like a bar
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
but they're just selling beer and wine
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
and mixed cocktails that are you know
 
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
premixed so the all intents of purposes
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's essentially the same people still
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
are capable of getting drunk by drinking
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
beer or wine or seltzers or canned
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
margaritas and so I think that that is
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
if if we're truly terrified of bars as
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
we seem to be in this state I feel like
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
we need to acknowledge that there's an
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in it right now and I I'm
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
trying to address that with this well
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's similar to the fact that um that
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
same category you talking about the beer
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
and wine and the in the pre-made
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
cocktails which are lower alcohol than
 
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to actually make a drink is
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
the same thing when it comes to their
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
beverage distributors versus the State
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that the tent to the
 
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
legislature all the way back to 1834 was
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
that yes that the distilled is a
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
different category and that the only
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
people who should be in the distilling
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
business are the people who have sered
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
meals dinner you know full full-fledged
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
meals yeah I mean somebody thought that
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
at some point I don't know that the
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
majority of people share that view and I
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
also think this back in 1834 in 1934
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
yeah right coming straight out of
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition I'm sure they had real
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
cleare eyed Vision on on what alcohol La
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
what they were they afraid of um they
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
just got rid of the prohibition they we
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
just got rid of prohibition I'm sure
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
they were super open-minded about
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
opening up the doors but no I mean I
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day if I drink
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
10 beers and drive home from a
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant that's a concern if I
 
01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
drink there no bar no facility would
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
ever give you 10 beers okay but what
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
whatever you get my my point you know
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
don't get hung up on the numbers try to
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand my intent of what I'm saying
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
which is if I over consume beer or wine
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
and drive home that's a problem or act
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
like a jerk outside that's a problem
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
those things that happen whether we're
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
selling beer and wine or whether we're
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
selling liquor and I struggle to
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
understand what the fundamental
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
difference is between somebody drinking
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
a couple margaritas or Gonic or drinking
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
several beers and being
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
inebriated the outcome is the same
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
you've consumed some level of alcohol
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
that imp impairs you and so the idea
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we have this special regulation and
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
we still will have a special regulation
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
because there is no requirement on food
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
SA sales as a percentage of total
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
revenue if you just have a beer or wine
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
license what it does do is it makes
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
people who maybe don't enjoy beer or
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
wine from being able to go to these
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
places um I I think it's I I think it's
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and I'm trying to like work
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit right and and I
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
know you realize it but I just make sure
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
all the committee understands that it's
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
not just beer and wine it's up to 14% so
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
those pre-made margaritas pre-made
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
drinks um are are available as an option
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
right okay so we do have questions on
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
this side we'll start with
 
01:57:26.679 --> 01:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
this side we'll start with
representative

01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
taxton uh I guess this is a point of
 
01:57:32.669 --> 01:57:32.679 align:start position:0%
inquiry or
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
clarification while I hardly support the
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
idea of reducing the requirement from
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
five days to three days for all the
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
reasons already stated I am not quite
 
01:57:43.159 --> 01:57:44.990 align:start position:0%
reasons already stated I am not quite
clear

01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
on the current law is if my food food
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
sales drop under
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
$75,000 a
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
year uh then I have to say my my my food
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
sales are $50,000 a year whatever that
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
is 25 only I have a limit of 25,000 in
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh alcohol sales and 2 I have to have
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
another offsetting 25,000 in food sales
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
is that correct essentially yeah so if
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
you don't sell $75,000 worth of food so
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
we're not talking total revenue we're
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
talking just food Revenue just food then
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
then 50% of your total revenue in that I
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
can't sell more than $25,000 worth of
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol if I sell in my example of 50
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so I sell
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
$25,000 worth of if you're total revenue
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
is 50 if your total revenue is 50 if
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're selling $50,000 worth of food you
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
can sell up to $50,000 worth of alcohol
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
got it all right so my total revenue is
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
50 I can do 25 and 25 if I sell 50,000
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
in food I can sell 50,000 in Boose right
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
got it I'm not sure 15% seems really low
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
to me I mean I agree with the chair
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're really running a bar at that
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
point so at so it's it's sort of the
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistency my argument is the
 
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistency with the current liquor
 
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
laws that we have so like I said you can
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
sell as much beer and wine as you want
 
01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
and that does not matter it's only the
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
hard alcohol portion and I just think if
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're worried about overc consumption or
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know what the intent is
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
because like you know the chairman said
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
that this was written coming out of
 
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition and who knows what they were
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
thinking um but it it it to me it's just
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
a it's a blatant inconsistency it's
 
01:59:36.430 --> 01:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
really glaring when you look at it and
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
it and it is preventing businesses from
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
operating the way they want and I think
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
that this is the Commerce Committee we
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
should try to be making it easier for
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
businesses to run and not have burdis
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
some regulations
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
that don't clearly serve a public
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
benefit and and I haven't heard somebody
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
make a strong case as to why this little
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
car out for just the hard alcohol
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
portion is is important but you did say
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
you understood that having food was a
 
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:05.149 align:start position:0%
you understood that having food was a
good

02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
thing I'm I'm fine with the food I mean
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
I think I think having food
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
is most likely what's going to happen no
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
matter what because there even in places
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
where other states where there are no
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
food requirements most places that sell
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol have food so I think I mean what
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
I believe is we all know what I believe
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
I believe in the free market let them do
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
what they want but I think that having
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to get rid of food I'm
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to make it easier for people
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
to create establishments that are
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
potentially productive but are
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited by our ownis regul there
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
could be the unattended consequence that
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
they might sell very little food at all
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
that but at least they have food as an
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
option like I think that's that is is
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
what I would think the intent is like
 
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
are we trying to force food on people or
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
we okay well I don't I don't think we
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
should force food on force people to eat
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
food yes so I I have a problem with that
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
but then why aren't we doing that for
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
beer and wine that's that's where I
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
think we beer and wine used to be there
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
and that was that was look so we are
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
capable of changing we are like I said
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
we started the food requirement started
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
I think when I first got here it was 150
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
right so you know so we've chipped away
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
at it over time make it a little bit
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
better okay representative Gibbs
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh just to throw out as a
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
possibility uh representative Sullivan
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of percent required
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
percentage for food sales would you be
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
open to something between 15% and 50%
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm open to
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
negotiation thank you let's make a deal
 
02:01:42.599 --> 02:01:46.790 align:start position:0%
negotiation thank you let's make a deal
okay

02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
here have you heard anything from anyone
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's specifically a business owner or
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
somebody trying to start a business that
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
say that that is indicating that this is
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's stopping them from opening their
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
business yes that's that's the
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
motivation behind this
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill can you tell me what the context of
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
that yes they have a I so there's two
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
cases and one of them that I'm more
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh they have a business
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
going and they can only sell beer and
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
wine and they are not capable of
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
building out a full kitchen to meet this
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
requirement it's also a small space
 
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:21.639 align:start position:0%
they make the 20 seat requirements so
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't impact them um but they
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
they don't really if they were to build
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
out enough to to do a full restaurant
 
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
they do sell food as is because that's
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
is a requirement and they they it's
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
pretty good food but they cook it off
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
site and bring it in
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
and so they they just aren't able to
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
really I don't know if they are I don't
 
02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
know if they would even hit the 15% to
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
be honest but um I I'm not part of the
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
business but I do know that right now
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
that they are not eligible to be able to
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the primary motivation behind
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is like I just saw it firsthand
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
that this is a pretty honorous
 
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
regulation that is preventing this
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
establishment from fully
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
running represent
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
bull um just a clarification are they a
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant do they have a restaurant
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
license if yeah I mean there there's no
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
bars in New Hampshire so of course they
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
have a restaurant license right do they
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
have but do you just you just said that
 
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
they bring the food in they prepare it
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
offsite and then they cook they like
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
heat it up and cook it there yeah
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
so is it LIC is it licensed with the
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS the kitchen is the kitchen licensed
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
with no it wouldn't be A's yeah would it
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
would be It's usually the town's uh code
 
02:03:44.079 --> 02:03:45.229 align:start position:0%
would be It's usually the town's uh code
Code

02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
Code
 
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
Enforcer it's licensed it's open it's
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'll take you there if you want
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
tacos okay you're you're do they have do
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
they have a full kitchen no they don't
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
have a full kitchen okay they have a
 
02:04:02.589 --> 02:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
preparing they have a space where they
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
do they do prepare food they don't they
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the three sinks or the or the
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
no they have the three sinks they have
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
the three sinks no no you got to have
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
the three sinks for cleaning but then
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
you got to have another two sinks for
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
washing the floor so I bet you they
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't have no they do they have they
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
have that they had all the sinks they
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
have the sinks yeah they just don't have
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
the septic system no they have Town SE
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
and water they don't have they don't
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
have they don't have stoves they don't
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
have they don't have stoves they don't
 
02:04:31.069 --> 02:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
have you know whatever yeah deep fryers
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff okay represent grassy
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
yeah uh would you believe that I'm
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with with a restaurant similar
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
to that or a place it's basically a brew
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
pub but they serve food that they get
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
from another restaurant that prepares it
 
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
for them and they just resell it at
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
their place they cannot sell alcoholic
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
beverages as well and and other than
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
beer and wine and I think that's what
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
your bill is is attempting to address
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know they they they they sell
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
appetizers basically as pretzels yes so
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
under the beer and wine license you have
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
to have some food available we didn't
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
get into the big deal about it and that
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
was and that that yes I was in the room
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we passed that but they wouldn't be
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
able to sell mixed drinks right and I
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
would the distilled ones that are o that
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
are not premixed that was the that was
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
the distinction I was trying to get
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
across I would believe and I would
 
02:05:25.229 --> 02:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
believe that's now three that I've heard
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
of so I'm sure there's more I'm sure
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of other businesses
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
that would be made that would benefit
 
02:05:32.549 --> 02:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
from this regulation and this isn't
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
quite softening in the way that the beer
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
and Line license apparently was Sofer at
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
some point so thank you very much all
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
Mike

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
good uh morning afternoon Mr chairman uh
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Mike Summers
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
with the logic and Restaurant
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are actually opposed
 
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
to this bill we have concerns um
 
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
interesting discussions you're having um
 
02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
I think the example over here to my
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
right I believe that's a nano brewery
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
license if I'm not mistaken not a brew
 
02:06:11.549 --> 02:06:11.559 align:start position:0%
pub a brew pub has the ability to sell
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh mixed drinks Etc BR pu definitely has
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
distill but they have the full food
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
requirement they do full-blown kitchen
 
02:06:18.239 --> 02:06:19.350 align:start position:0%
requirement they do full-blown kitchen
correct

02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
um so going back to the uh testimony of
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill and certainly
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bringing this bill
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
forward um you know if you're not
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
producing the food on the site I I don't
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
know that you need to have a full-blown
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
liquor license and and I'd also just
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
take a step back you know the comment
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
about you know can can somebody do
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
enough sales to meet the 50% or
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
$75,000 you're gross sales would have
 
02:06:46.549 --> 02:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
only have to be $150,000 and you already
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
meet the 50% requirement or the 7
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
$75,000 $150,000 in this industry is
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
nothing most McDonald's are over a
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar in sales in any given
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
year so that is a very low threshold and
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
in fact uh in talking to a lot of our
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
members a number of them actually
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
suggest we should maintain the 50% and
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
potentially take the $75,000 up to what
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
chairman hun mentioned a minute ago
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and to just give some
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
perspective here because sometimes it's
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
easy to talk about a big number and get
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
lost but at the $75,000 threshold that's
 
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.109 align:start position:0%
lost but at the $75,000 threshold that's
only

02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
$1,443 a week in food
 
02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
sales it's about $289 a day if you're
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
open five days a week that's nothing
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know five six eight guests at
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know cheeseburger and a drink um and
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
at 150,000 it's it's less than $3,000 a
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
week and it's about $577 a day if you're
 
02:07:48.669 --> 02:07:48.679 align:start position:0%
open five days a week um the other
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
concern we have obviously is moving the
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
threshold from 5 days to 3 days and I
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
would also say and I believe if
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
Department's going to testify but right
 
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
now there is a mechanism in the statute
 
02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
that allows for if you uh get a full
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
service liquid license you can apply to
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
the liquid commission to get that
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
reduced to two two days three days
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
whatever so there is already a mechanism
 
02:08:10.109 --> 02:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
in place for the commission to add its
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
discretion to allow business to to Cy
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
come down to a lower number of days and
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
again I go back to the Staffing comment
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
earlier we've certainly seen that we've
 
02:08:19.549 --> 02:08:19.559 align:start position:0%
experienced that we've shared an update
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
with our members to make sure that if
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
you go less than five days make sure you
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the liquor enforcement
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
investigators make sure that they're uh
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
they're aware of what you're doing so um
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
those are our concerns and obviously
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
look forward to a subcommittee work
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
session so with that I'd be happy to
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions okay representative
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
taon so you represent the restaurant
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
owners is that correct a lot of them yes
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
about about a third of the industry we
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
represent and so I I think I probably
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
basically agree with you on the the the
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
numbers but I also believe people have
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
the right to
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
fail uh and I recognized I did the same
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
Matthew did and came up with $1,400 in
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
change a week and said well that's
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
almost not worth showing up for if
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's your gross receipts you're not
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to make it as a you're not going
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
to make it but maybe as you said a food
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
cart or something which then that's a
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
different argument so I I agree with you
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly on leaving it at 50% but
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
I do have a concern over the
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
what over your opposition to the
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
reduction of the number of days from
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
five days to three days and what's
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
counted as a day because it's
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
apparently uh U Sunday brunches would
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
not be aren't counted I'm not that
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with it but as uh God knows the
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
worst thing you could want as a real
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
estate agent to be involved in a a
 
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
running a restaurant that's a one of the
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
many keys to failure we're pretty good
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
agreed pretty good at using bars but um
 
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
the so my my question is if you could
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
develop your reasoning
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
behind not reducing it to five days
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
because I see people attempting to
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
operate restaurants and they're
 
02:10:07.069 --> 02:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
profitable three days of the week and
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
they're basically paying to be open a
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
day or two a week and this has always
 
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
troubled me I as a business owner myself
 
02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
I thought God if you guys just closed up
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
two days a week you'd be okay so if you
 
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
could explain to me why they have to be
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
there five days a week I'd really like
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
to know so the five days is just the
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
current standard and as I as I mentioned
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism already built in
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
the statute that you can operate for
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
Less days it's just a process you go
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
through with uh The Liquor Commission
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and during the course of the
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic we had an awful lot of
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
businesses that applied for a less than
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
five days and were and received it
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
simply because they didn't have Staffing
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
right we went through a whole thing and
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
so our position is that the mechanism to
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish the three days is already in
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
the statute so we don't know that it
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh necessarily changed we
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
also think that there in order to
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
operate a full service restaurant which
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
is distilled Spirits you know full bar
 
02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
the whole bit that there should be some
 
02:11:06.549 --> 02:11:06.559 align:start position:0%
guard rails in place and I would just
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
like to mention I forgot to say it in my
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony but this committee uh not two
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
weeks ago passed unanimously the
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
penalties for uh over service for um uh
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
serious injury and death resulting
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
increased it by 300% so it seems a
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
little bit counterintuitive that it
 
02:11:26.189 --> 02:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
would not make a whole lot of sense to
 
02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
start to ease those restrictions uh
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
where we I think would agree that having
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
food available and consumed whilst
 
02:11:34.990 --> 02:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
consuming alcohol is probably part of a
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
mitigating factor in these particular
 
02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
relationships but I'll get off the soap
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
box you'll never forgive us for that
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
will you representative ta all things
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
heal in time well so in the case of
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
further inqu
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
given that I agree with everything that
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
you just said except how are five days a
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
week a guard rep what he's saying is is
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
and I thought we had this legislation
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
years ago I think Jean Chandler put it
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
in for someone up in North Conway that
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
we that you could be less than five days
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
but you had to make a request to the
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
commission so maybe we just need to
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
write that into the statute I guess we
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
did that by It Isn't So it's just not
 
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
not in this it's not included in the
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill but there's another section correct
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
another I don't have my glasses on sorry
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
then and exemption exemption right and
 
02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
and the commission has usually been very
 
02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
receptive to just tell us why you need
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
to do it and no problem and that was my
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
that was my memory so but unfortunately
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't have the bill in front of me so
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
I could have said I think I wrote that
 
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay okay represent gives
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um regardless of the specific
 
02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
numbers and you probably heard me a few
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
minutes ago suggesting that there might
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
be a percentage number somewhere between
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
15% and 50% that would be appropriate
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
but regardless of the specific numbers
 
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
or calculating it out to the dollar
 
02:13:15.549 --> 02:13:15.559 align:start position:0%
amounts and so forth um having heard
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan tell us that
 
02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
there is at least one and it wasn't
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
clear whether there might be three that
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
he knows of but at least one that one
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
business that he knows of um that has
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
told him that the current uh statutes um
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
prevent that business from operating in
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
the way that they believe would be most
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh presumably most profitable
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
and also provide the best service to
 
02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
their customers it's not clear to me um
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
what the basis is for um opposing
 
02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.910 align:start position:0%
what the basis is for um opposing
greater

02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
greater
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility normally I would agree with
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
you but I think the issue you're going
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
to find and I'm actually going to defer
 
02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
part of the qu your question to um
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement because my
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is in order to have a full
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
service liquor license you are required
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
to have a fullservice commercial
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
kitchen I believe that's true and so if
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
this uh particular company cannot or is
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
already space restri red where they
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
cannot put in a full service kitchen
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
changing this is not going to help them
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
because ultimately they cannot bring
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
food from outside and serve it and then
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
say that they are meeting the food
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
requirement it was one of our
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
frustrations under the Nano
 
02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
Brewery uh progression let's call it
 
02:14:37.149 --> 02:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
progression where we we slowly whittel
 
02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
away any food requirements whatsoever
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
and now they can actually have somebody
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
else bring it in from outside
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
so but I will defer to the commission on
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
that but I believe that that is the case
 
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
they need to have a full a full
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen in order to meet the
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
food requirement regardless of whether
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's 15% or
 
02:14:57.549 --> 02:14:57.559 align:start position:0%
50% correct that's what I thought right
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I would just say that when it came
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the Brew Pub legislation that that
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
they had to be they they they held them
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
to that it had to be a restaurant that's
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
right and and therefore they to get the
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
license they had to go for the full
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
liquor license the 1280 because but they
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
could sell the stilled but they had that
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
was the that was the deal that was
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
struck to create the The Brew pup
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
license which we'll learn more
 
02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
about more to come more to come all
 
02:15:28.559 --> 02:15:30.109 align:start position:0%
about more to come more to come all
right

02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
represent maybe this is a question for
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the commission I I'm just curious does
 
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
the exemption is it indefinite or do you
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
have to reapply for the
 
02:15:41.629 --> 02:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
Daniel why don't you come on on up
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
everybody all done with Mr Summers okay

Elon Deputy Chief of New Hampshire
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
Liquor enforcement um the exemption can
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
be um done at their license renewal if
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
they've already received it they can
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
request the exemption again at the time
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
that they renew and we can continue with
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
the exemption so it's not um the
 
02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
renewals are approved so it can be a
 
02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.149 align:start position:0%
renewals are approved so it can be a
continued

02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%

03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
had it I could have had
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
it but then again I might have spilled
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
my I I'll just my chili dog on it and
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have been good I mean the
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that I gave the clerk which
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think had been distributed as a
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
Court lever letter from the professional
 
03:22:16.309 --> 03:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters for the bill so you should
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
have two documents well I'm just hoping
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody has a problem with that
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
they're here in the room yes I tried to
 
03:22:27.950 --> 03:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
make sure no one left had any problems
 
03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
okay so tell me when you would like me
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
to start Mr chair and I'll walk through
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay this is a replace all
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment like that um and it's uh
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:43.309 align:start position:0%
Amendment like that um and it's uh
035

03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
035
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
toh so the first thing so Mr chair um
 
03:22:49.030 --> 03:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
what I thought I would do is I'm just
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to walk through the bill um in
 
03:22:55.870 --> 03:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
order of the pages and uh this will
 
03:22:58.030 --> 03:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
reflect all the conversations that we
 
03:23:01.150 --> 03:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
had last week at the work session so the
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
first thing I did was um we talked so if
 
03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
you go down to page one um line between
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
line 28 and 29 there were three
 
03:23:14.590 --> 03:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
definitions there one was for frat
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
fabric one was for fabric treatment and
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
one was fluorinated uh containers those
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
definitions have been
 
03:23:26.110 --> 03:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
removed I mean I'll explain we'll just
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
go through and I'll explain everything
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
as we go okay so then on page two um
 
03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:34.349 align:start position:0%
as we go okay so then on page two um
line

03:23:34.349 --> 03:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
35 um I removed the reference to um and
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
methylene carbon atom
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that the remaining definition of
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
pasas uh conforms to the one most
 
03:23:51.389 --> 03:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
uniformly used in the US but most
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
importantly conforms to the definition
 
03:23:55.790 --> 03:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we have in our own statutes under
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
the firefighting foam
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
section um the next thing I did for
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarification um page
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
three whoops line 11 um I made sure uh
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
to note that uh P added product includes
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
a p added uh consumer product so it's an
 
03:24:23.080 --> 03:24:25.309 align:start position:0%
a p added uh consumer product so it's an
all-encompassing

03:24:25.309 --> 03:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
definition um on line 28 page line 25
 
03:24:36.830 --> 03:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
page uh three does everybody have okay
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
um so you recall what I said earlier
 
03:24:43.710 --> 03:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
that I removed the definition of fabric
 
03:24:46.349 --> 03:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
um and I have replaced the definition of
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
fabric with the def it's identical but
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's textile um because there was all
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
there were words textile and fabric used
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
in here and I was trying to make things
 
03:24:56.760 --> 03:24:57.670 align:start position:0%
in here and I was trying to make things
more

03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:25:00.269 --> 03:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
uniform uh the next definition I added
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
was textile
 
03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
Furnishings um because we're going to uh
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
discuss adding that to the product band
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
list it's what we talked about before
 
03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then um line 30 one I have a
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
definition textile
 
03:25:17.790 --> 03:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
treatment um that's basically that was
 
03:25:20.349 --> 03:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
fabric treatment but I'm just trying
 
03:25:22.830 --> 03:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
again to make the um make the
 
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
definitions more homogeneous still make
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
Scotch Guard I mean they make stuff yeah
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
and Scotchgard is still out there I mean
 
03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
I can't they still make I mean you guys
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
talked about resolve with the fell from
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
Waste Management right carpet cleaner
 
03:25:44.189 --> 03:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
and so I the but that's for resolves for
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
carpets that's clean well this is It's a
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
carpet cleaner right you're right okay
 
03:25:52.269 --> 03:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
so um I believe yes they still make
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
these fabric treatments um and in fact I
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
think that some of that stuff is what's
 
03:26:01.710 --> 03:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
even used by the carpet cleaning people
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
to treat the rugs so okay so that's that
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
um so the next section which is a very
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
important section and one that everyone
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
has been very interested in um it starts
 
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
on the top of page
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
four um this is the the so sections
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
three four and five are the new
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
exclusion sections the first one
 
03:26:33.429 --> 03:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
excludes um from the coverage of this
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
law drugs and medical devices that are
 
03:26:41.670 --> 03:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
um subject to regulation by the US Food
 
03:26:42.830 --> 03:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
and Drug
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
Administration um so
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
basically dental floss and certain types
 
03:26:52.189 --> 03:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
of PPE which are included in the product
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
band section are in fact medical devices
 
03:26:58.710 --> 03:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
um approved by the FDA and I
 
03:27:01.110 --> 03:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
communicated directly with the folks
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
that make these
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
things um and that's so I think it's
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
necessary to do this
 
03:27:12.269 --> 03:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
exclusion um the next thing that I've
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
excluded is uh water
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
utilities and uh wastewater treatment
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
plants because they were concerned
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
because they handle things that have
 
03:27:25.229 --> 03:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
pasas in them even though they're a
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
byproduct of their
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
processes uh that they not be considered
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
as subject to this bill at all which
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
03:27:39.309 --> 03:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
um the next thing for the exclusion it's
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
actually something that the chair would
 
03:27:44.510 --> 03:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
was very interested in so I'll have to
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
tell him about it when he comes back um
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is the exclusion for um hydr floral
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
olins which is uh hfos that's a
 
03:27:57.990 --> 03:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
replacement refrigerant for a much more
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous refrigerant that has uh
 
03:28:05.550 --> 03:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
deleterious effects on um on the climate
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
and ozone layers and everything so this
 
03:28:12.189 --> 03:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
provision is basically uh it excludes
 
03:28:15.389 --> 03:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
products that are approved under the
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
what they call the snap policy and also
 
03:28:20.269 --> 03:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
under the American innovation and
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing act this has been
 
03:28:24.990 --> 03:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
discussed with the lobbyists for
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
Honeywell and span um the sustainable P
 
03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
Action Network they've approved the
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
language they've seen um the amended
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
language uh just clarifying that and
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
they've agreed to this the exemption
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to products that are
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
banned by this act which for the most
 
03:28:45.990 --> 03:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
part uh wouldn't have they don't have
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerants anyway but just in case
 
03:28:51.429 --> 03:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
there was something in there um the next
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing page four uh line between line 15
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
and 16 this was where the notification
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
provision was and also the labeling
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
provision um I've removed each of those
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
sections as we discussed in their
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
entirety so they're totally
 
03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:12.469 align:start position:0%
entirety so they're totally
gone

03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
gone
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the next thing
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh is in the product ban section so if
 
03:29:28.189 --> 03:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
we go to page five um number three had
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
been fabric treatments I renam that to
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
be textile treatments to do what I told
 
03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
you I was doing um I've removed
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
fluorinated containers from this list
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
and I've also removed remove dental
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
floss and for those of you um when you
 
03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
if you recall the last time there we did
 
03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
talk about doing um an exclusion for um
 
03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
products overseen by fifra which is the
 
03:30:00.510 --> 03:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
the statute involved in
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
pesticides um I've gone back and forth
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
talking to the pesticide folks and I
 
03:30:08.229 --> 03:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
decided at this point it was important
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
to keep our pesticides in their
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
containers and I have removed
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
fluorinated containers from this list
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
but um in lie of that I've added textile
 
03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh Furnishings which is draperies and
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
things like that which we have inside
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
our house which are treated with p and
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
emit quite a bit of P um and textile
 
03:30:33.189 --> 03:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
Furnishings I pointed out to you was
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
defined in the earlier part of the bill
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
um this is something that's also
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
supported by the waste industry um
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
because because textile Furnishings
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
carry an enormous
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
load so um now that the chairman is back
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
did you do you want to talk about the
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
exclusion language regarding the F hfos
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so um go back to page four
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
please um at the top uh these are the
 
03:31:07.189 --> 03:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
three exclusions and I went went through
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
it already for the rest of the
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the first one is an
 
03:31:14.429 --> 03:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
exclusion for drugs and medical devices
 
03:31:17.710 --> 03:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh regulated by the FDA so that includes
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
certain types of PPE and um I've
 
03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
communicated with the industry folks on
 
03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh the PPE ban and I am
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
100% convinced that medical devices
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA should not be
 
03:31:36.510 --> 03:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
included in the coverage of the bill so
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
I've included an exclusion here um and
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're happy with that I've
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
communicated with them I do have drugs
 
03:31:45.389 --> 03:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
as well even though drugs aren't really
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
covered by the bill it just all goes
 
03:31:52.030 --> 03:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
together um number four is an exclusion
 
03:31:55.070 --> 03:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
um to answer concerns of the Wastewater
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
and public water system utilities folks
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
they don't actually intentionally add
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
past to anything but they were really
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that the end product of uh
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
like sludge and things like that do have
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
P in them and they didn't want they were
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
really concerned that they might be
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
considered as somebody under this bill
 
03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm excluding them entirely um I
 
03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
worked with the New Hampshire uh
 
03:32:23.710 --> 03:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association to nail down this
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
language accurately so the next um
 
03:32:29.590 --> 03:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
exclusion is number five um I explained
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
it for the rest of the committee Mr
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
chair but this is the hfo exclusion um
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
and significant New Alternatives policy
 
03:32:42.910 --> 03:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
program is snap that's the program that
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
um is uh sort of blesses alternatives to
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
much worse stuff like refrigerants hfc's
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and this is the language I work
 
03:32:55.950 --> 03:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
closely with the lobbyists on they've
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
approved it they've seen this amendment
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
I I showed them the amendment the whole
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
thing before I shared it with you so um
 
03:33:06.670 --> 03:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
and then there's an exemption for things
 
03:33:12.510 --> 03:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise banned by the bill so that's
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right there they gave me the thumbs
 
03:33:20.269 --> 03:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
it um and then the only other thing uh
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
is on page six I have uh the language
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
requested by the chair which sunsets the
 
03:33:39.630 --> 03:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
dees position 5 years after passage five
 
03:33:41.429 --> 03:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
years after implementation of the
 
03:33:41.439 --> 03:33:43.550 align:start position:0%
years after implementation of the
product

03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:45.429 align:start position:0%
product
band

03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
band
 
03:33:49.389 --> 03:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
so um I actually went back and looked at
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the YouTube I think I've got everything
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
here that we talked
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
about isn't that great that YouTube yes
 
03:33:59.710 --> 03:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
it is you know it is you can relive
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
jokes and all kinds of right all that
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
stuff we missed all those years I've
 
03:34:07.229 --> 03:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
been in the rep and we who knows now I
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
have people to rely on me telling the
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
story right so if you have any questions
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
okay any questions to committee
 
03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
members I actually have a question thank
 
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
you if if somebody had a a product that
 
03:34:25.269 --> 03:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
was highly concentrated in with past how
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
how do you dispose of
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
it um you know at the moment it's not
 
03:34:34.110 --> 03:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
considered a hazardous material um so
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
but if it were me and I knew that it was
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
concentrated with pasas I would bring it
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
to the hazardous waste collection days
 
03:34:44.110 --> 03:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you oh yeah they would they
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
would take it um but if you look at the
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
statutes it hasn't yet been designated
 
03:34:54.510 --> 03:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
waste it's ski wax it's very
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
concentrated oh yeah evidently yeah yeah
 
03:35:02.670 --> 03:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
it is I mean which we can add to our
 
03:35:02.680 --> 03:35:06.309 align:start position:0%
it is I mean which we can add to our
product

03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:11.189 --> 03:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
van okay and everybody else said okay
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.469 --> 03:35:41.479 align:start position:0%
phone I'm
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon I'm sorry that's
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
okay for the record my name is Sarah uas
 
03:35:49.950 --> 03:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
Kern which is a mouthful so you can feel
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
free to call me Sarah Kar and I'm the
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the waste
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
management division at the Department of
 
03:35:56.720 --> 03:35:58.710 align:start position:0%
management division at the Department of
Environmental

03:35:58.710 --> 03:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
Services uh Dees has reviewed the
 
03:36:04.750 --> 03:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that you were just
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
discussing and the amendment
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
significantly addresses a number of the
 
03:36:13.110 --> 03:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that we expressed in our letter
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
of testimony from earlier this
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
month um that being said we remain
 
03:36:21.710 --> 03:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill however we look
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward to continuing to work with the
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor on it and we'll be following the
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
interest okay now we I wasn't expecting
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
to S take a position but so we were more
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
worried about anything that was a fatal
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
flaw that we
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
we we believe we could implement it
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
based on the amendment okay so make sure
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
I understand now with these band set
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
these uh companies who produce anything
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to the clearing house
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
can you just review for everybody so we
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
all understand with the whole role of
 
03:36:59.469 --> 03:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
the Clearing House and what what that's
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
all about sure and um with the
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we don't believe that it would
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
be 100% necessary for us to to implement
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
the Clearing House we wouldn't have to
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
implement it in the way the original
 
03:37:18.990 --> 03:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
Bill fora we would recommend that uh the
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire get a membership
 
03:37:24.030 --> 03:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
to the Clearing House which is much less
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
expensive than purchasing a module
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
having it designed for us so um in this
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
reduced role if we were to purchase a
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
membership that would cost about $7,000
 
03:37:39.150 --> 03:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
a year for a membership and that would
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
help us to
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
learn about the Pas content of products
 
03:37:47.309 --> 03:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
and help us to um coordinate with the
 
03:37:48.670 --> 03:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
companies that are going to need to
 
03:37:50.710 --> 03:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
submit their information to us I think
 
03:37:53.229 --> 03:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
it would make it easier for the
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers right because the the
 
03:37:58.750 --> 03:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
overing problem is is every time I
 
03:38:02.070 --> 03:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
say like food packaging so does there
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
any food packaging out there that have
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
past and I always get the same respones
 
03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
nobody knows so what's always been the
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
most scariest part about this
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is that is I have no idea
 
03:38:16.239 --> 03:38:17.150 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is that is I have no idea
what

03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
I'm what we are regulating
 
03:38:22.830 --> 03:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
here yes and there's information that
 
03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's food packaging fast food
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
packaging that contains past things like
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
that uh in the first hearsay right
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't we can't actually
 
03:38:35.070 --> 03:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
identify any packaging do we do we
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
actually know is there packaging I I
 
03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
believe that we know that there's
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
packaging and number of other states
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
have banned food packaging with pasas
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
already um in the implementation period
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
if this bill was enacted uh the the
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
employee that the bill would put into
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
place would look into exactly this which
 
03:38:59.309 --> 03:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
products have Pas uh there would be some
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
money for hiring a company to do some
 
03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
testing uh so that we could get some
 
03:39:08.590 --> 03:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
data yes and in that case at some point
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
um they could come running back to us
 
03:39:13.389 --> 03:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
and look for that exemp in our exemption
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
section to be added to it if they can
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
make a case for why they deserve to be
 
03:39:18.319 --> 03:39:20.189 align:start position:0%
make a case for why they deserve to be
Exempted

03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
03:39:24.750 --> 03:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative MCU thank you Mr
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for coming to help us
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
with this today on the the nine things
 
03:39:32.030 --> 03:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
that are mentioned as categories of
 
03:39:32.040 --> 03:39:33.429 align:start position:0%
that are mentioned as categories of
banned

03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
banned
 
03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
items which of those produce
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
bioavailable or have bioavailable pasas
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
in them that are at the biggest biggest
 
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
risk for entering into the consumer's
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
body and can you give us an example of
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know XYZ product or
 
03:39:50.760 --> 03:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
you know XYZ product or
whatever

03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:39:57.630 --> 03:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
um I think it's perhaps a question more
 
03:40:00.030 --> 03:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
for a toxicologist I'm a geologist but
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's possible that representative eel in
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
her research for this would be able to
 
03:40:06.269 --> 03:40:06.279 align:start position:0%
um give you the answer for
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
that I can tell you um from where I sit
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the waste management division at Dees
 
03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
that we hear from landfill operators
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
that one of their biggest concerns uh is
 
03:40:22.590 --> 03:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
carpets added to landfills adding to the
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
Lei you know and clearly um anybody
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
who's in the waste management business
 
03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
not just waste management but that they
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
all want us to pass this legislation
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be on the
 
03:40:39.439 --> 03:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be on the
hook

03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
hook
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the water pollution
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking is if you sit on your
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
Scotch Guard and couch or you're at a
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
higher risk of kidney cancer you set on
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
your SC couch who knows who knows we can
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
answer some of that you know for sure
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
I've read articles from the National
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health where they show that
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
they and and blood measurements where
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're showing how food packaging uh
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
can show that an article of food can be
 
03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
in food packaging and show up in your
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
blood within minutes right uh articles
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
of uh what volatility from carpeting
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
showing it entering the bloodstreams of
 
03:41:24.830 --> 03:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
children within minutes of crawling
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
around on a carpet this it is pretty
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
well known that it does we know that it
 
03:41:32.110 --> 03:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
can happen but we don't know if it's
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to cause kidney cancer words they
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
put this way it would be a lot easier if
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of people were dying in a in a
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
certain neighborhood whatever because
 
03:41:44.110 --> 03:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
they had that excuse me in some cases
 
03:41:45.870 --> 03:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
they do if you want to read the right
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
literature you will find it if you
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
really want to dig for three hours like
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
I do okay they actually know what the
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism how the how the P molecules
 
03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
are attaching themselves to the to the
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh fatty acids in the blood right which
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
clogs up the liver and clogs up the
 
03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
kidneys they do autopsies and find
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
livers that are that are damaged Beyond
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh recuperation with cancer you're
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
johnas yeah but but that's what I'm
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
saying is but that we all have different
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
DNA that are susceptible and some are
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
not susceptible right and some of us are
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
ugly what does that
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not going to say pres company
 
03:42:33.389 --> 03:42:33.399 align:start position:0%
included because we're all beautiful
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
people no the point being is is that we
 
03:42:40.189 --> 03:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
know that it gets in BL we know all this
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
is true the problem we can't say is that
 
03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:45.710 align:start position:0%
is true the problem we can't say is that
that

03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
Pepsi is probably going to kill
 
03:42:52.510 --> 03:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
me it's going to kill you we cannot say
 
03:42:52.520 --> 03:42:53.830 align:start position:0%
me it's going to kill you we cannot say
Scotch

03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
Scotch
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
Guard you know that if you if you spray
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
Scotch card to tomorrow on your we
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
cannot say that you're G to I think
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
about was um Jordan's Furniture who you
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
always talk about how great their
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
Furniture was and and they're throwing
 
03:43:11.469 --> 03:43:11.479 align:start position:0%
glasses of wine on the thing and saying
 
03:43:13.590 --> 03:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is look what a Marvel this thing is
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
impenetrable this is a great service and
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
you all say what is on there and and if
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
we buy it am I going to die from it we
 
03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't know don't know if if it looks
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
like a duck and it quacks like a duck
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's a duck yeah it's cumul cumulative
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
um impact right so if you're um using
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
Teflon is another one I don't know why
 
03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's not in here but if you're using
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
you know nonstick
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
um pans every day I do and you're G okay
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
so that that myti life that that has te
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
in it that and aluminum so so and then
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you sit on your couch for three hours
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a combination of all that
 
03:43:56.429 --> 03:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
plus if you have you know hereditary I
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
mean candles and then you have candles
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know in your bathroom and you're
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
burning that you know every day it's
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
just if we can eliminate some of these
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
toxins then that's what we need to do a
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
little bit I understand why we're doing
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
it okay I understand that chem we can
 
03:44:16.189 --> 03:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
see that chem it's in our bodies it's
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is always been how do we
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
identify how do we know which one to
 
03:44:23.630 --> 03:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
yank off the shelf and the reality of
 
03:44:26.950 --> 03:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation is we don't we're just
 
03:44:29.229 --> 03:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
taking the product
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
category and saying we don't want this
 
03:44:34.149 --> 03:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
sold in our state anymore because we
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't know which carpet or which piece
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
of furniture or which carpet cleaner or
 
03:44:43.830 --> 03:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
any of these we cannot say to any one
 
03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
product this is easy to identify we want
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
to yank this from the Shelf
 
03:44:49.950 --> 03:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs is
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
next thank
 
03:44:56.189 --> 03:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
you we don't know which carpet is going
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
to kill which person and we don't
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
know that any particular type of carpet
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
is going to kill everybody but from what
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've heard so far both this year and
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
last year is that we know that a certain
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
number of products in this category are
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to kill a number of people because
 
03:45:23.950 --> 03:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
we've had people testify that they have
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
cancer that has been identified as being
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
caused by this category of product and
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
that I would say that's a good enough
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
reason to not have those products sold
 
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire because
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to kill some people and I'd
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
them

03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative I I would represent to
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
you that if we pass this bill you're
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to see products that are going to
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
come on the market that they're going to
 
03:45:59.110 --> 03:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
be labeled that they don't have past
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
free right right so so that's no reason
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
not to go through with this because we
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't know which saying I am not arguing
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
about I'm just saying is my frustration
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
and obviously is not your frustration
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
because you guys all think we should
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
just pass this legislation because
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
somebody came in and said I got cancer
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
oh come on okay I resent that okay but
 
03:46:24.910 --> 03:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's what sound like what you just
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
three of you said was people got cancer
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
and they came in and told us they got
 
03:46:32.149 --> 03:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
cancer from p no some of us actually
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
looked into stuff okay
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
but the issue is where if you looked at
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
the stuff you could answer my simple
 
03:46:39.239 --> 03:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
the stuff you could answer my simple
question

03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:43.149 --> 03:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
show me a product that's in the
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now that's going to give
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
you cancer and I'm just saying to you is
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
I have no problem passing this
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
legislation I am more than willing to do
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
it but I just am very
 
03:46:59.469 --> 03:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
frustrated that I don't know how to
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
identify the product the caring house
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
and and more specifically Mr chairman
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
more more specifically where's the
 
03:47:10.110 --> 03:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed published random IED
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
control trial that links a to c and that
 
03:47:15.149 --> 03:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
is not right I mean that's the tricky
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
part there's there's no doubt in my mind
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
like representative spear said and we
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
talked about this previously that
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of data that P is bad I
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't want it in my water don't
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
particularly wanted on my carpets or on
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
my couch either the the question is I
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking what are these give us
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
some examples of these nine products and
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
the best science that we have which
 
03:47:40.950 --> 03:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
should be a peer reviewed in a high
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
level data in a high level Journal right
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed published randomized
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
control trial I mean that's
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
scientifically how you make that
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
conclusion and no other way it's not
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
rumor conjecture an anecdotal been
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
researching there's information out
 
03:47:58.429 --> 03:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
there okay the federal uh what is it the
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
FDA published two articles in
 
03:48:06.269 --> 03:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed uh toxicology I guess uh
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
magazines and I don't remember the name
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I I could dig it out for you
 
03:48:12.149 --> 03:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed the whole works where they
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
said that they found that the FDA was
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
passing products that were in fact
 
03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:20.309 align:start position:0%
passing products that were in fact
causing

03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
causing
 
03:48:23.149 --> 03:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
cancer identifiable cancer but you know
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
what the great I want to know what the
 
03:48:26.910 --> 03:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
name of the product was I will give you
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
what's the name of the prod all I'm
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
asking is for a name diet they said a
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of product with no all I'm begging
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
is tell me theit minute what about
 
03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
they're all known to cause cancer got
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
from 3M in laim M and and Dupont they
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
did probably the best peer-review study
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
of anybody ever they studied their own
 
03:48:49.469 --> 03:48:49.479 align:start position:0%
employees for 30
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
years but they still make de Teflon now
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
it wasn't Teflon that they were doing at
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
the time it was like uh the um Scotch
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
Guard and and things like that which is
 
03:49:00.510 --> 03:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
why 3M say they're not going to make it
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
anymore because that Dupont rather
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't make has Scotch Guard really
 
03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
been removed from the product I I don't
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we don't know I I
 
03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that okay but they did that
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
they did that study okay on their own
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
employees I heard that yes you did tell
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
us about that before representa taxon
 
03:49:23.910 --> 03:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
so going back to the the real question
 
03:49:26.429 --> 03:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
here is as a piece of
 
03:49:28.990 --> 03:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
legislation it feels like the right
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
thing to do but I don't have any
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
quantifiable information that says it's
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do that's my problem
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
period that's it there a lot of emotion
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
over this which I think is
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
misplaced okay thank you very much Sarah
 
03:49:50.110 --> 03:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I wanted to offer I
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this group has had a
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
chance to speak with de's toxicologist
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
Dr patali but if uh the group would be
 
03:49:59.550 --> 03:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
interested we could make arrangements
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
for I would say anybody who can tell us
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
a product that's going to be banned or
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
just going to be affected by this leg
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
love to know what it is yeah just love
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
to know something Scotch Guard is no
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
longer on the market by the way Scotch
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
Guard is no longer on the market okay
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
Ammon okay ask question what say I have
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
a a question oh for Sarah or or Ken or
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
either one okay I guess come on yeah so
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
this is quite an extensive list and I'm
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can narrow it down to
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
just the worst offenders and start there
 
03:50:34.750 --> 03:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
you know like what's the what's the
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
minimum viable product for a piece of
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation like this where you know we
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
we can start with the the worst of it
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
and then see how that goes and then
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
maybe adjust our list from there is
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
there an idea of what that could be um
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
could I just get the list I mean they
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
they were all and I want to answer one
 
03:50:54.359 --> 03:51:08.149 align:start position:0%
they were all and I want to answer one
of

03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.159 --> 03:51:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
them

03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.429 --> 03:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
um okay so why don't we
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
just go to the product ban list and I
 
03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
just want to if it's okay I want to
 
03:51:24.680 --> 03:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
just want to if it's okay I want to
start

03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
out um first of all by saying you do
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a letter in support from um um an
 
03:51:36.990 --> 03:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
who uh basically outlined for you the
 
03:51:42.670 --> 03:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
health um effect
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
information um in some
 
03:51:45.359 --> 03:51:47.269 align:start position:0%
information um in some
detail

03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
detail
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
um and I can get more Health Data I mean
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the federal
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
government or the state would be
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
requiring testing of pasas to the
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
trillionth if there wasn't plenty of
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
peer reviewed data in support of the
 
03:52:11.469 --> 03:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
problems with pasas I there um endocrine
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
disruptors there's any number of things
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota one of the things that uh
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
prompted the passage of their law was a
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
young woman who had an unbelievably rare
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
cancer um that was directly related
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
proven to P exposure so there's no
 
03:52:36.269 --> 03:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
question that that you know there are P
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
issues related to health and you know I
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
guess we talked so much about the health
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
effects when we were talking about the
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
carpets bill before um I didn't bring a
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
lot more health information in here if
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's something the committee needs we
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that Jonathan patali is
 
03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
the toxicologist who is a specialist in
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
P he could talk for days about this
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
issue I just there there's just
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question that P is bad for
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
your health so the next thing I did
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee in a packet
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
when during the original hearing there's
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
a document from
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
swana um and it says here where you get
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
the most exposure directly to p and
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's food packaging Cosmetics dust
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
from all these products that have P in
 
03:53:39.870 --> 03:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
them and carpet so that's
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
this on the co topic of food packaging
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
if you Google food packaging past you
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
can come up with any number of things
 
03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
but just yesterday um thinking about
 
03:53:55.229 --> 03:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
this question Mr chair I um came across
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
a consumer reports article which I'd be
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
happy to provide to you that gave you
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
very specifics on fast food um
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
operations and the exact packages that
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
you don't want to eat from if you go to
 
03:54:13.630 --> 03:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
an arb's and order a cookie yeah no I
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
got the consumer report but the consumer
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
report never use the word past they were
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
just saying Plastics no the one no
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's really recent there's yeah that's
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
one I had the recent one it's not that
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
one there's a previous one yeah so the
 
03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:33.070 align:start position:0%
one there's a previous one yeah so the
other

03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
thing what not sure okay so then the
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
next thing is landfill leade I also gave
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
you guys this document and what's in
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
here is um the places in our waist
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
stream that carry the biggest loads of
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
past into the landfills one is bulky
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
items which is furniture and carpet the
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
next category is textiles which I've got
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
here and whoops so it's bulky items
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
which is Furniture textiles and
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
Carpeting and that's how this
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:23.950 --> 03:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
um um that so it's very hard for me to
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
say to you that we should narrow this
 
03:55:31.710 --> 03:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
list um Vice chair am Ammon because
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
every single thing that's on here was
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
very specifically chosen a for the for
 
03:55:44.590 --> 03:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
the past load B for the um most uh
 
03:55:47.710 --> 03:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for exposure to human beings
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
and three because it was banned in other
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
places um so like carpets huge load
 
03:55:57.630 --> 03:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
children crawl around on them
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
Cosmetics I mean you're smearing these
 
03:56:03.149 --> 03:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
things on your face and they have past
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
in them and so that's on our swana list
 
03:56:10.830 --> 03:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
textile treatments um because of the
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
exposure from furniture and from carpets
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's why it's on the list it's just
 
03:56:20.149 --> 03:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
really bad stuff feminine hygiene
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
products they've got it in
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
there and you're applying it directly to
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
your body I don't really have to go into
 
03:56:29.790 --> 03:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
more detail food packaging and
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
containers we're eating out of the
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
things juvenile
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
products there's so many past in
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
products that are being marketed to our
 
03:56:42.910 --> 03:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
children age 12 and under I can't
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
imagine removing them
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
PPE I mean same thing we're sticking all
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
this stuff on our faces upholstered
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
furniture has an enormous P load and
 
03:56:57.149 --> 03:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
we're crawling and sitting on it and
 
03:57:00.189 --> 03:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
textile Furniture Furnishings again it's
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
textiles it has a large past load it's
 
03:57:06.189 --> 03:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
in our contained houses and we're
 
03:57:09.189 --> 03:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
inhaling it and it generates dust
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
so I just I understand what you're
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
saying about narrowing the list there is
 
03:57:18.510 --> 03:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
not one thing on here that I can say to
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
you was not really carefully selected
 
03:57:25.710 --> 03:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
for past load and maximal exposure to
 
03:57:29.149 --> 03:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
being thank you for that answer yeah I'm
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
sorry if it was more complete than you
 
03:57:35.830 --> 03:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
might have liked but uh I want you to
 
03:57:38.070 --> 03:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
understand I I just want to explain how
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
these product s got on to this list I'd
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
be interested you mentioned it sounded
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
like you were describing a matrix of the
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
N uh the nine things and they were
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
banned in other states y um and then you
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple other aspects I think
 
03:57:53.070 --> 03:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
i' like to see that list well you have
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
the safer I again I distrib the graph
 
03:57:57.870 --> 03:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned yeah yeah and if you
 
03:58:00.309 --> 03:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
still have it in your documents um if
 
03:58:02.349 --> 03:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
not I me it's in my drawer I have it
 
03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
yeah but I do have a follow question
 
03:58:04.399 --> 03:58:06.070 align:start position:0%
yeah but I do have a follow question
that's

03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
um could there be um unintended
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
consequences to the market and I I'm
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to imagine a scenario so
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
let's say we have another pandemic and
 
03:58:19.469 --> 03:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
it's really severe this time and PPE is
 
03:58:23.110 --> 03:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
in short supply and some of that PPE has
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
P um you know associated with it so we
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
have it it would reduce our supply uh
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know potentially I'm just trying to
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
think of like um because whenever you
 
03:58:37.710 --> 03:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
whenever you bring whenever you uh
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
mandate or ban something in the market
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
it causes unattended consequences can
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
you think of anything like that that
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
might be Rel um the only thing I would
 
03:58:47.950 --> 03:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
say is in the case of a well first of
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
all responding directly to your question
 
03:58:53.070 --> 03:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
about um the pandemic um that would be a
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
de there would be a declaration of
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
emergency and then the um and then the
 
03:59:01.950 --> 03:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
governor could just you know do what he
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
wants as far as the statutes were
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
concerned so but there is a anyway go
 
03:59:08.120 --> 03:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
concerned so but there is a anyway go
ahead

03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
um and and then the whole thing about
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences so um again
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
this goes this goes back
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
to why I was really careful to look at
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
other targeted bands in other states in
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
particular in California and how this is
 
03:59:34.149 --> 03:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
like an evolving thing and um a lot of
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
the products that I have here are being
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
banned in other other states and so if
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
you look at it as sort of a if I think
 
03:59:47.149 --> 03:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
of it like
 
03:59:49.469 --> 03:59:49.479 align:start position:0%
dominoes if you have something that's
 
03:59:52.149 --> 03:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
really horrible and what you're eating
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
or what you're walking on or sitting on
 
03:59:58.349 --> 03:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
then you want to get a
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
concentration of states that are saying
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want this stuff anymore please
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
take it out of our out of Commerce keep
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
it going
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so that's why yeah so I I did we
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
did some narrowing already we've done a
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
lot of narrowing we did and I'm my issue
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
is is that not not withstanding that we
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't in terms of identifying products
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
we can only asking people in the room
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah has anybody got a problem with this
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
do anybody not get an exemption that
 
04:00:31.389 --> 04:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
they would like to or want an exemption
 
04:00:33.309 --> 04:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
is everybody in have is it happy in the
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
room okay all we can do is then say the
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislative process is carrying forward
 
04:00:41.710 --> 04:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
Ward and there's several more bites at
 
04:00:43.710 --> 04:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
this apple before it leaves us it's
 
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to I assume I don't know uh
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
Finance it's go to finance because of
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
this the appropriation um so it'll let
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
that'll be and then it's going to go to
 
04:00:56.349 --> 04:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate yeah and then and ultimately
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
the governor and so if there somebody
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
has a problem they're going to they'll
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
let the governor know and he'll veto it
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
and then we can start all over again
 
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
next year so at this point um you know I
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
I I feel that we have narrowed it down
 
04:01:12.510 --> 04:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
we' solved the problems from the state
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
from like when Maine did which was
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
insane because they just simply said
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
everything without anything without
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
identifying anything without ning
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
without doing they just said everything
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
and and so all hell is broken up there
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we have this narrow I
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be almost model
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation for other states who want to
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
to to just get their feet wet in this
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
issue and find out and because it's got
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
the clearing house piece in it so I'm
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to to run with it even
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
though as a republican I I'm I'm like
 
04:01:47.429 --> 04:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
I'm shaking my head that we're Banning
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
something that nobody can actually tell
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
me what we're Banning you know I don't
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
know what product I'm making disappear
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
but we'll soon find out if there is a
 
04:01:58.590 --> 04:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
problem we'll soon find out so you have
 
04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
another question I can I can skip it
 
04:02:04.830 --> 04:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
okay represent piselli I had a question
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
about the implementation and if you've
 
04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
already covered this then I will
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
withdraw the question but there is a uh
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
generic list so I'm not really quite
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
sure how the actual implementation of
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
the ban and the
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
um the followup and the uh how will this
 
04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
be enforced I just that part I'm not
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
really quite sure what that's why we'll
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
we'll hire um somebody at Dees and Dees
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
has the option um to pass a set of
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
regulations that will help to put
 
04:02:44.189 --> 04:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
parameters around it but but quick
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
follow so okay Cosmetics you ban
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
Maybelline big lash mascara like who is
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
taking it off the shelf I just don't
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
quite understand the mechanics well they
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
will know I mean do you have a specific
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
product list with like we have a foure
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
window and so manufacturers will
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:12.870 align:start position:0%
window and so manufacturers will
be

04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
turn the mic yeah so
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
um so manufacturers will progressively
 
04:03:23.070 --> 04:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
be removing P from their cosmetics in
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
fact in California I mean this bill sets
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
up an intentionally added past standard
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
for all these products in California for
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
Cosmetics you cannot have any past they
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
have a list a mile long of things you
 
04:03:40.590 --> 04:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
can no I know so what I was going to say
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
is that over the course of the next four
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
years until the ban is implemented the
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
other thing that's going on is that EPA
 
04:03:54.149 --> 04:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
is kicking off a required
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
reporting um thing that shows all the uh
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
things that have pasas in it and that
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
will be up and running the reporting
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
requirements will be up and running by
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
May of 2025 that's 3 years before our
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
band can come into place and so we can
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
be starting to look over the docu the
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
the items that they've reported on that
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
have pasas in them and start to narrow
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
down the um thing but the other thing is
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
keep in mind this is a bill that puts
 
04:04:27.120 --> 04:04:28.030 align:start position:0%
keep in mind this is a bill that puts
the

04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility not on our retailers but
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to stop making these items
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
with P in them and they will be banned
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
from selling them into the
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
state so um it's on them and it's not on
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
our local
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
people representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I want I'm wondering uh if you can
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
tell us um what products or types of
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
products you considered Banning that you
 
04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
decided not to ban that you did not put
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
on this list of nine products yeah I
 
04:05:09.910 --> 04:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
will be happy to and you can um you know
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're welcome to add um I did
 
04:05:16.590 --> 04:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
not put apparel on here I
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
think you know actually in in thinking
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
about it in some ways the way you did
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
Vice chair um Ammon I didn't I mean this
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
is big but I didn't want to get into
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
apparel also people feel really strongly
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
about the gortex in the state and also
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about apparel you can
 
04:05:38.349 --> 04:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
all you can have many exclusions to it
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's just really a complicated area I
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
also didn't feel like there were enough
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
states that were diving into that right
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
off the bat so that was one thing that I
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
didn't include I didn't include cleaning
 
04:05:55.830 --> 04:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
products a vast area it includes
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
Industries hospitals it just seemed
 
04:06:00.670 --> 04:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
really complicated to me that's
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
something that Minnesota is working on
 
04:06:05.070 --> 04:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
right now it could be added at some
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
later date definitely a problem and then
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I don't have in
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
here is
 
04:06:15.149 --> 04:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
cookware and thank you and the thing is
 
04:06:15.159 --> 04:06:16.269 align:start position:0%
cookware and thank you and the thing is
in

04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
California um as part of their past ban
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't ban cookware they had a
 
04:06:27.149 --> 04:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
labeling requirement for cookware so if
 
04:06:29.550 --> 04:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
you start seeing cookware labeled for
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
its past content that's why and they
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
have a similar law that they passed um
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
in Colorado labeling requirement
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
Minnesota um I think you may see as a
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
result of that you know more and more
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
cookware coming off the market I
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't touch a Teflon nonstick pan for
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
all the tea in
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
China I well I don't know you what you
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
do is you look and see if they've been
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
made with past and and that's you know
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then you know like the chair was
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about apparel where
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
in California they're starting to get
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
rid you know they have a law that says
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
no pfas and apparel REI is starting to
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
withdraw all its pasas added uh and so
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's how you start seeing um the
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
effect of these bands manifested in the
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
products that you're buying and once the
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
EPA EPA reporting requirement is up and
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
running I mean that it will be public
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we can check all kinds of things on
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
there so we just had pass around a
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
letter from the professional firefighter
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um so in New Boston we
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
have the space force station used to be
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
the Air Force Station and we have a p
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
problem from the firefighting foam that
 
04:07:49.710 --> 04:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
they used there for many decades went
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
into our groundwater so I appreciate the
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
this letter I don't know where it came
 
04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
from some it came from me came from I
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%

it's the same one yeah thank
 
04:12:59.309 --> 04:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
you um I guess I'll set it up a little
 
04:12:59.319 --> 04:13:02.389 align:start position:0%
you um I guess I'll set it up a little
bit

04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
um so this is an amendment for House
 
04:13:05.000 --> 04:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
um so this is an amendment for House
Bill

04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:13:06.159 --> 04:13:12.950 align:start position:0%
Bill
1674

04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
you guys ready okay um so the original
 
04:13:18.109 --> 04:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
Bill if you remember had three parts to
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
it and it was it was a big reach um it
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
had making gold and silver legal tender
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
it had the state establishing a Boolean
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
depository and it had an electronic
 
04:13:33.389 --> 04:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
currency portion to the bill and uh to
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
me the last two were were the most
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
interesting this Amendment removes the
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
Boolean depository and the electronic
 
04:13:44.109 --> 04:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
currency piece um and what I'm thinking
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
is in future years those two things
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
could lend themselves
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
to a stable coin um uh uh I want to say
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
regime but that's not the right word a
 
04:13:59.109 --> 04:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory system for stable coins which
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
would include a gold and Sil a gold and
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
silver stable coin and it could be not
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
the state but third party so the state
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
would and we can get into that next term
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
right so I took that out I think those
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
two um those two sections are useful for
 
04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
a future and and a broader discussion
 
04:14:17.710 --> 04:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
and a a more wellth thought out
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
discussion but what we did was uh just
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
remove or just keep the original
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
language uh of the um of making gold and
 
04:14:28.229 --> 04:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
silver legal tender we removed a bunch
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
of definitions that no longer applied
 
04:14:31.109 --> 04:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
because they're not in the language
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
anymore um we we put in uh an a
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
reference to uh some federal statute if
 
04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
you look on page two line line 11 that
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
was new that was just to clarify what
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
what it meant previously and we moved
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date out to January 1 it
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
was it was July so we gave it another
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
six months um I've since had a
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
conversation with um Christine
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
heck um do you want to talk about you
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
sent us an email last night saying you
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
were going to look at the bill and I
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
think you had an additional thought and
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
Katherine I'm getting your name mixed up
 
04:15:11.399 --> 04:15:15.349 align:start position:0%
Katherine I'm getting your name mixed up
I'm

04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
sorry so your concern was about applying
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
this to municipalities making it
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
mandatory for municipalities um and and
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
you had an additional
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
thought thank you representative Aman A
 
04:15:27.309 --> 04:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck and I
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
represent the 234 cities and towns of
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we have been talking
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor on making sure that
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
municipality aren't compelled somehow to
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
use um silver and gold in day-to-day
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
transactions as we believe that there
 
04:15:45.790 --> 04:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be significant cost internal
 
04:15:48.990 --> 04:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
controls and a real restructuring of how
 
04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
local government functions in addition
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
to a lot of expertise needed and the
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor is very willing to um he
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
appreciates um our concern and has been
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
working to address those concerns
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
however when we look at I apologize I've
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
only seen the amendment on the computer
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to and there's a couple
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
copies over there on the table if uh
 
04:16:12.109 --> 04:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
anyone needs one when we look at the
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
amendment it discusses that no person or
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
apologize um P page two line two page
 
04:16:29.309 --> 04:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
two line two thank you so much I
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so specifically no
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
person should be compelled by another
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
person to accept legal tender so we are
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions we are not
 
04:16:41.189 --> 04:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
persons so again we we've talked about
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressing that concern and maybe
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that political subdivisions
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
cannot be compelled meaning it would be
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
a local option not a you know mandate
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
and in addition uh it discusses that any
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
taxes paid that are issued by the state
 
04:16:57.990 --> 04:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that again is
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
concerning because we collect swept tax
 
04:17:02.229 --> 04:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state so it's a state
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
Levy that we collect on their behalf so
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
we would just want to make sure that
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
that it it could be considered that we
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
are somehow carved out of a compelling
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
mandate so that we can decide for
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves if this is something that
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
moves forward um in our state that it is
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
done so at the local level by local
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
decision making so I think that was our
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
our comments and our concerns if if we
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
add that language if if we decide to
 
04:17:32.189 --> 04:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
move forward with this adding that
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
language would satisfy your concern yes
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
it would okay all right and um King do
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
you have any comments and so now we kind
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
of had this this is mainly original
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
language and we had a broad public
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
hearing about it but now we're just
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
focusing on this one aspect so I'm sure
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
you have some thoughts on it I
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
think oh I'm sorry somebody had a
 
04:17:56.429 --> 04:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
Gibbs uh excuse me uh sorry could you
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
tell me where we would find that um
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
provision that no one would be required
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
to accept or silver yeah so page two
 
04:18:10.990 --> 04:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
line two on the amendment I I I'm sorry
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you page two line two on
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment is it says uh A person
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
shall not compel another person and you
 
04:18:22.510 --> 04:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
would add um a political subdivision yes
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you and that that was uh
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime we talked about that so
 
04:18:30.030 --> 04:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
Dr

04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives um my
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
name is Keen mang Wong tax policy
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
council with the New Hampshire
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue uh thank you very
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
much uh representative Ammon for
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
forwarding the uh copy of the amendment
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
to us uh I only managed to read it this
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
morning uh and we quickly um had some
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
identified certain concerns uh with with
 
04:19:04.990 --> 04:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
this uh specific
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.510 --> 04:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
see so first off um I think I think it's
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
quite obvious that uh this is uh
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
something new for the Dr to uh to to
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
work on
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh accepting or or looking at uh
 
04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
returns with uh that's not in US dollars
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
so whether it's in it's in different
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
um different function functional
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
currency or different legal tender um so
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
I think the first concern that we had
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
was um all our tax laws in New Hampshire
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
all the amounts the thresholds um that's
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
report that's used in in our tax act New
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Tax Act are all using US
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
dollars so um if the currency that's
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
being used uh by these qualified
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
business units are in a different
 
04:20:06.189 --> 04:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
different functional currency um and if
 
04:20:09.070 --> 04:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
they're reporting uh on their returns in
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
a different functional currency um so I
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
think the the concern is how what kind
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
of exchange rate would be used to
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
translate that into uh to see if if
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
certain thresholds for certain
 
04:20:24.429 --> 04:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
deductions and things like that or
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
taxability uh would be considered when
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh reporting the return I I guess um
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
because the one of the language in the
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill is that the um the taxpayer is
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
allowed the option to actually pay tax
 
04:20:42.189 --> 04:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
or even report their return in a in a
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
different functional currency than US
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
Dollars and and only they would only
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
convert that to US dollars if they like
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes in US dollars so um I I
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the concerns that we
 
04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
have how would that look like we're not
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
really sure but something that we want
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
to raise to make sure that the committee
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
is aware of that um the other thing is
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
that um let's say if we were going to be
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the books of certain
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are using a different
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
functional currency um than a US dollar
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh we're not really sure how their books
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
would look like um if they're using gold
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
um how how would a book how how would
 
04:21:22.590 --> 04:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
their accounting records look like in
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
terms of reporting of of of their
 
04:21:27.870 --> 04:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
journal entries in terms of um some the
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
transactions in in gold or in silver in
 
04:21:33.550 --> 04:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
other precious metal um so that's also
 
04:21:35.309 --> 04:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
another thing that that we we're sort of
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
not sure but but um so I just want to
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
raise that um and regards to functional
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
currency so yes um the qualified
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
business units are allowed to uh keep
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
their books and Records in a different
 
04:21:49.840 --> 04:21:50.830 align:start position:0%
their books and Records in a different
functional

04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
functional
 
04:21:50.840 --> 04:21:52.630 align:start position:0%
functional
currency

04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
currency
 
04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
um granted that functional currency is
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
not really defined in this amended bill
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
but I would take it take that to assume
 
04:22:02.710 --> 04:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
the functional currency would include um
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
these different legal tender um that is
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
um defined here in in the 5D colon 2 um
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
like speci legal tender um
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
bullion um and things like that um
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
another item is
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
that oh so for um for business taxes for
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
business profits tax purposes um
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
business taxpayers are are able to file
 
04:22:38.070 --> 04:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
a combined return so if um if a meaning
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
to say that if a a a
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
tax a business organization they have uh
 
04:22:48.189 --> 04:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
different um divisions or different
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
business units um and and they are or or
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
different different
 
04:22:55.870 --> 04:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries they similar like similar
 
04:22:58.109 --> 04:22:58.119 align:start position:0%
to like a federal Consolidated return
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
but this is for New Hampshire side it's
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
not a consolid return is a combined
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
return so the concepts of combined
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
filing uh is applied here so then we're
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're thinking if um if this group of
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers has one qualified business
 
04:23:17.469 --> 04:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
unit that's using a different currency
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh that which is a legal tender New
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal tender currency which is
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
not US Dollars and then um and then
 
04:23:28.830 --> 04:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
another part of this group is using US
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
Dollars and then when they file their
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
return they're required to follow if
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
they they if they meet the requirements
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
of um of unitary if they're unitary then
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
they need to file a combined return one
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
return uh to the New Hampshire
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue then how would
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
that return look like if they if one of
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the qbus decide to say okay we're going
 
04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
to pay our taxes in a different currency
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the rest of the group say okay
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
they want a US dollars so this is
 
04:23:55.149 --> 04:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
probably some something internal that
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
they would decide themselves however um
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing that we were
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
thinking okay how would that look like
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
if they want to do that that's the
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's the ability
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
for the um for those business units to
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
make that decision that way and if it
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
serves their business purpose to do it
 
04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
that way then um currently our our
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
structure is not catered to that we only
 
04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
reporting everything in in one US dollar
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the the other concern is the um the
 
04:24:33.070 --> 04:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
no tax implication from converting um
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
one legal tender to another legal tender
 
04:24:39.149 --> 04:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
or purchasing um purchasing or sale of
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh booon when not giving rise not give
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
rise to tax
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
liability um maybe potentially if that
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
language could be narrowed down to
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
potentially just for reporting purposes
 
04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
versus the say if the taxpayer was to be
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
investing in Boolean um and then so when
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
when the price is low they purchase a
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of booon and when the price
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
is high convert that to a different like
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
a US dollar currency and then gaining
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of um
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh exchange gain in that sense um and if
 
04:25:19.469 --> 04:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of a business
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
activity we think that probably should
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
be taxable um of course this is a policy
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
concern if if the if the committee feels
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
that okay those kind of transactions are
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
still not taxable but then I we just
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
think that maybe if if we were to um so
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
there kind of like a speculation at play
 
04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
here here where people just Pro probably
 
04:25:39.790 --> 04:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
play the Commodities market and stuff
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
like that um so um I'm not sure that's
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
something that's um considered by the by
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
the committee um and then finally it's
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
also the cost involved as uh that's what
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
Katherine he had mentioned if um if
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were to start paying their
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
taxes in uh something other than US
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
dollars as if they're using spey gold or
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
spey silver or bu on um there would be
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
definitely some cost involved for
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for Dr to accept those
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
kinds of precious metals and security
 
04:26:19.870 --> 04:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure how to maintain that um
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh so th those are generally our
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
concerns with this they sound like Val
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
valid concerns to me U questions over
 
04:26:29.790 --> 04:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
here I'll start with representative mler
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you um the first thing that
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
well you started talking about but the
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
first thing that jumped
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
out to me on this bill is is again line
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
one page two I have no idea how this
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to uh short-term
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
long-term capital gains or losses um I
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
just don't understand it because it's in
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
fact it would be the same thing as if
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm you know trading International
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
currencies and if I've got gains I pay a
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
tax on them so that was the first thing
 
04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
the second thing which is actually my
 
04:27:07.149 --> 04:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
first question is I just don't
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
understand the practicality of this at
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
all I I just don't see that it's it's
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
needed that it's necessary um maybe uh
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon can address this
 
04:27:23.429 --> 04:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
but what is really the purpose of this I
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't get it thank you I think the uh
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of this bill I it's more
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
of a policy question and I I'm not in
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
any position to address that that that
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
question okay yeah represent Gibbs thank
 
04:27:42.269 --> 04:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
you um my questions are actually for you
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative em and um and just I I
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
just need to back up a little bit
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh to be sure I understand correctly if
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
I am an owner um or an employee of a
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
business who needs to have a bill paid
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
or I am a tax collector at any level of
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire state or
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
local and so somebody comes to me and
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
says I want to pay my bill or my taxes
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
in gold or
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
silver under this bill I could say no
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
the payment must be in dollars is that
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct I so that's the
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
next line on page two line two I just
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure of that mutually
 
04:28:28.149 --> 04:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
agreed upon I I'm sorry it would have to
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
be mutual okay um and then um I guess my
 
04:28:35.469 --> 04:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
my other question is um going along with
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
repes representative melier and that's
 
04:28:43.149 --> 04:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
basically why we have um currency in
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
this country uh the dollar which has a
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
full faith and credit of the United
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
States government um and what I don't
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand is why we need anything
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
else you want to know the answer to that
 
04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
um okay so um we're not we're not the
 
04:29:06.429 --> 04:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
only state considering this there about
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
10 states that have done this already um
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it it ties in with the US
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it's referenc in the
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill it's article uh one section 10 and
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
it talks about um no State shall and
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
then there's a list of things in it says
 
04:29:26.109 --> 04:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
so no no State shall dot dot dot make
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
anything but gold or silver coin a
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
tender in payment of debts so so that
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
the state has the ability to to uh
 
04:29:36.510 --> 04:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
follow the to uh
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
explicitly enact that I wasn't asking
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
why we can do it I understand what you
 
04:29:43.710 --> 04:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
just said that's the foundation I was
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
asking why would we want to do it uh do
 
04:29:49.790 --> 04:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
you want to know the answer or do you
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to ask questions um question yeah
 
04:29:55.229 --> 04:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so this is my personal feeling
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
um the the inflation that we've gone
 
04:30:00.109 --> 04:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
through and we've gone through several
 
04:30:02.670 --> 04:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
periods of inflation uh that it might
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
make sense to have sort of like an alter
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
alternative that's based on
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles um that maybe
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
only a few people will use but um we
 
04:30:18.670 --> 04:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism for uh avoiding a
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
significant inflation event um you know
 
04:30:24.750 --> 04:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
so this gets into representative maer's
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
question last week about you know is
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
this a
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
philosophical uh
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
discussion the this is my opinion the
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
national debt in the beginning of this
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
year just a few weeks ago past $34
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
trillion um the interest on that debt is
 
04:30:44.189 --> 04:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
approaching $800 billion that's as much
 
04:30:46.590 --> 04:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
as we spend on defense and the
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
projection is that it could get
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
hyperbolic at some point right so this
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
is sort of like a um a
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
precaution uh and you know maybe you
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't agree with that but there are
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
people there are people in my town that
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
that would like to be able to do this so
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's it's it's
 
04:31:10.830 --> 04:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary but it's a a way to uh use
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
another currency as legal tender but is
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
there anything that currently prevents
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
any individual from keeping gold either
 
04:31:22.109 --> 04:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
gold coins or gold bullion for any
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
purpose either as a hedge against
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
inflation or for instance as my father
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
did as a protection in case God forbid
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
another Hitler were to arise and we had
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
to have something that we could pick up
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
and and carry across the border
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
in desperation as he and his parents had
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do in in in in
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
1938 uh there's so far as I know there's
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in the current law that prevents
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
you from doing that right so you can
 
04:31:51.109 --> 04:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
hold gold uh in your possession of
 
04:31:53.229 --> 04:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
course that's no but this is uh there's
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
no prohibition against that but this is
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
for transactional purposes right so this
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
is to sort of make it a a part of the
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
economy in a very small way for people
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
that want to do it that that's my best
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
so and I I'm really going to try and not
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
go down the economic Rabbit Hole
 
04:32:18.269 --> 04:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
here the 6:1 ratio called out for in the
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution never worked and was always
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
a problem and that's
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
been covered in numerous different
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
places of subsequent
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation economic changes the Federal
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
Reserve Act the the uh taking the United
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
States off the gold standard making the
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
dollar non-convertible all of those
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
things while they're fascinating to
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
people like me are probably outside the
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
scope of what anyone in this room wants
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with right now so the it seems
 
04:32:55.950 --> 04:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
to me that the point of this bill is to
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
achieve something which already exists
 
04:32:59.429 --> 04:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
marketplace if I have a box full of
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
Krueger rans and I want to buy your
 
04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
house with that box full of Krueger
 
04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
Rands and that works for you under New
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law we have something called a
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
barter and sale
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
deed I can you can that's a legal
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
transaction Y and that transaction for
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
reporting purposes Department of Revenue
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
Annihilation would be to say What's the
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
value of those that box of Krueger RS at
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
today's gold price and that's the
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%
transfer we pay the transfer tax off of
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
that in United States
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:37.109 align:start position:0%
that in United States
dollars

04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
this the the problem of
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
inflation of the United States dollar
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
which has been more or less continuous
 
04:33:45.359 --> 04:33:47.390 align:start position:0%
which has been more or less continuous
since

04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
1795 again for a whole lot of
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
interesting and not relevant
 
04:33:52.359 --> 04:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
interesting and not relevant
reasons

04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
be you're you're trying yeah it's a
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
concern it's a concern for all of us but
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
this isn't the fix on it so if I have a
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
whole box of Krueger RS or if I'm like
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs fathers and I need
 
04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
to have an emergency slush fund which I
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
completely that's not that's outside the
 
04:34:17.789 --> 04:34:17.799 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill I need that's a
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
tangible asset something that's
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
convertible or something I can trade
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
with it could be diamonds it could be
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
gold it could be Krueger RS it could be
 
04:34:28.390 --> 04:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
barold and then after the change in the
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
law in the GRE Administration we're now
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to own gold as American citizens
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
which we were barred from
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
previously so other than the fact that
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go I have a box full of
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
Krueger RS and I want to pay my
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
$76,000 tax bill to the town of Troy
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it's a good day to sell
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
gold uh I can take that and sell it on
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
the open market and then bring those
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and go pay the tax collector I
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
would point out to you and I don't know
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
who somebody testified on behalf of the
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
tax collectors if you're not aware of it
 
04:35:08.670 --> 04:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
it is illegal for any tax collector in
 
04:35:10.029 --> 04:35:10.039 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to have more
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
than $1,500 in a safe
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
overnight so I don't know where you guys
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
live but that doesn't even cover one
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
person's tax
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh so the practicality of
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining gold if you're going to mess
 
04:35:24.670 --> 04:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
with this stuff you're going to have to
 
04:35:27.629 --> 04:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
look at a whole lot of other things and
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
limits that we have set up in our
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
statutes besides Krueger rants because
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
there's no Bank in the United United
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
States that's going to let you walk in
 
04:35:40.830 --> 04:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
and have and give them $76,000 worth of
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
gold pieces and say gez thanks we were
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
hoping somebody would do this
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
today yeah so cougar I don't think would
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
be covered by The Spill but I get your
 
04:35:49.080 --> 04:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
be covered by The Spill but I get your
point

04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I use krugger as an easily
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
understandable example of gold coins I'm
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
sure you do do you have anything to add
 
04:35:59.551 --> 04:35:59.561 align:start position:0%
uh no that's that's it for okay thank
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%

04:36:07.029 --> 04:36:07.039 align:start position:0%
questions just for now um I want to um

him and he wanted to testify in the
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
original hearing uh but his wife had a
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
health condition that prevented him from
 
04:36:22.590 --> 04:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
coming so he's here and I you know we'll
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%

being understanding about my wife's
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
issues and that's that's actually part
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we simplified this
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
bill for this year um you pull right up
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
to your your face yeah that's part of
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
the reason why we simplified this bill
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
um is I haven't been able to come up
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
here and put the time needed in into it
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
because of that but um first I want to
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
say uh I registered yesterday as a
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyist um just yeah I I haven't it
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
takes time to make the tags and I
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but I I am registered
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist um I I'll give you some
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
quick background on myself only so you
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
understand I am not dick marpel um for
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
those you know may you rest in peace um
 
04:37:21.869 --> 04:37:21.879 align:start position:0%
so Air Force veteran I was a KC 135
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
pilot um flew out of Saudi Arabia um
 
04:37:26.429 --> 04:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
then I got my PhD and taught at the Air
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
Force Academy um was a business owner
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
for a while wound up working civil
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
service in the Navy um and the last
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
several years when I saw all the kind of
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
macro events
 
04:37:39.150 --> 04:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
unfolding um I thought it was time to
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
start doing something about what I think
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
I see is coming which is you know a
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollar crisis I'll put it that way um
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
and because our debt to GDP is 140% if
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
you look at history uh Any Nation that's
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
hit that number n it's over 95% have
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
defaulted um now that doesn't mean they
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
default uh by not paying people back for
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
their bonds but it's they inflate the
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
currency so and keep the rates down so
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
that they can do a default a soft
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
default via inflation that happened
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
after World War II that's how we paid
 
04:38:18.150 --> 04:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
for World War II is we we uh screwed
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
over the bond holders um and I I don't
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
want that to happen to people in New
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or this country and I I you
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
know the federal government's not going
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
to change this because they benefit from
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
this it allows them to spend like crazy
 
04:38:32.830 --> 04:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
um but the States you know are far more
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
responsible so that's why we're working
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
04:38:37.470 --> 04:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
um I am the chair of citizens for sound
 
04:38:38.910 --> 04:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
money it's a
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
501c4 uh by our by laws the majority of
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
the board has to be outside the precious
 
04:38:45.551 --> 04:38:45.561 align:start position:0%
metals industry so we are not
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
representing um precious metal vendors
 
04:38:49.750 --> 04:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
we work with them and communicate with
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
them we we're representing consumers uh
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
and also business owners that want to
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
use this in their
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
business um represent am talked about
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh so I'll stick to uh
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know the amendment I will point out
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
that uh there's similar l language uh
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
legal tender speci language in uh seven
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
states Utah Oklahoma Arizona Wyoming um
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
Utah was the first pass it in
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
2011 um also Arkansas recently and then
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's two states that my understanding
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
is have had it since the 1800s they just
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
didn't pull it off the books uh Colorado
 
04:39:24.279 --> 04:39:25.189 align:start position:0%
didn't pull it off the books uh Colorado
and

04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:25.199 --> 04:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
and
Missouri

04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
Missouri
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh so big discussion here is you know is
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
this needed
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a couple couple
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
486 left my phone but but it basically
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
says that if you have a gold or silver
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
coin and you are you know trying to pass
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
that off as money um that you can be
 
04:39:55.990 --> 04:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
fined or impr prisoned and and and one
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
one person one company was in prisoned
 
04:40:00.430 --> 04:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
for five years I believe um for doing
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
that and it says unless otherwise
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
authorized by law and that's what this
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
bill is about is authorizing it by law
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
now um the bill right now only says us
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
gold and silver coins are legal tender
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
um then it says the treasury can add
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
some and that's why I understand the
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
concerns of Dr in this um and but but
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
because of because right now it's just
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
gold and silver eagles that are legal
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
tender by the statute um I don't think
 
04:40:32.750 --> 04:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something that is
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
exercised um because if you if you look
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
at a gold eagle face value of $50 who's
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
going to use that exchange rate to pay
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
taxes okay so so the the payment of
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
taxes portion I would say is symbolic
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that says the state
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes this as money um whether or
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
not the state collects any taxes
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
currently is not important um to us
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
anyway but but the state saying that
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
this is money is important and you know
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
imagine the chilling effect when you see
 
04:41:08.350 --> 04:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's been arrested for they made a
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's not called a coin because only
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
Sovereign um can make coins it's a round
 
04:41:16.270 --> 04:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
but you make one and you you try to
 
04:41:18.670 --> 04:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
spend that and um you know the company
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
that was making these they did other
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
things wrong but they got convicted of
 
04:41:26.270 --> 04:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh convicted of under USC 486 and that's
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
a big chilling effect on business so
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
that also addresses you say well you can
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
barter uh that that is true but because
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
of USC 46 you are placing placing
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
yourself at risk and that has a chilling
 
04:41:38.910 --> 04:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
effect on businesses trying to use this
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
as uh as money
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
um let's see I I just made some random
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
notes as people were talking uh so the
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
the the really only use case given that
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
right in in the bill as it stands it's
 
04:41:54.750 --> 04:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
gold and silver eagles the only use case
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
where anybody would have anybody not
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
crazy would want to pay their taxes is
 
04:42:01.948 --> 04:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
if if they use that language that's in
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
there about um about keep your books in
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
that currency and uh we put the
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
reference to the federal statute that's
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
in there because it's very common
 
04:42:12.430 --> 04:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
practices for companies using foreign
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
currencies and we're just modeling okay
 
04:42:16.270 --> 04:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
how could you have a system where you
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
have gold currency but you also have US
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
dollar currency side by side and and so
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
the federal statutes cover that that
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
well and there's some details in there
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh to provide guidance
 
04:42:31.230 --> 04:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
um uh someone brought up federal capital
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
gains this this bill is about the state
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so us saying it's not
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
taxable doesn't mean that I I understand
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
the concern about if it's a business uh
 
04:42:42.590 --> 04:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
doing it as capital gains but again if
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're viewing this as money which it
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
should be it is not a gain it is a
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
preservation of your purchasing power
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
gold hasn't gone from $40 to
 
04:42:55.868 --> 04:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
$2,000 it hasn't gained that much more
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
value it's actually if you look at a
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
chart of oil over the last 100 years
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's got ups and downs but it's flat the
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
US dollar meanwhile has gone like this
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
the dollar cost of oil so it's not a
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
capital gains it is a a preservation of
 
04:43:10.830 --> 04:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
your purchasing
 
04:43:10.840 --> 04:43:13.350 align:start position:0%
your purchasing
power

04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:43:15.550 --> 04:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't need anything from the
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
other dollars because it's the full
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of the US government
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
well I explained that debt to GDP of
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
140% so not all of us have faith in the
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
United States government I have far more
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
faith in the New Hampshire
 
04:43:27.920 --> 04:43:30.270 align:start position:0%
faith in the New Hampshire
government

04:43:30.270 --> 04:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
um represent was talking about something
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
where we kind of provide a framework for
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
stable coins I I think that's an
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
excellent idea um some of those may not
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
be what I would consider sound money but
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
eager to work with people on that we
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
think people should have multiple
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
options for currencies people overseas
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
are very used to this you know what
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
currency am I going to hold here we just
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
hey it's the US dollar it's the best in
 
04:43:54.430 --> 04:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
the world it has been but that that time
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
is I think dangerously coming close to
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
an end and you don't pass this bill um
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know two years later you may really
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
wish you had but again this is is laying
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
the foundation for what we actually want
 
04:44:09.390 --> 04:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
to do because you know gold and silver
 
04:44:11.230 --> 04:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
eagles is currency is not really
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
practical but we want to lay the
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
foundation for um legal tender species
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
including products other than those um
 
04:44:21.868 --> 04:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
gold backs are beautiful but then also
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
layering on top of that a digital
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
currency you know on the blockchain that
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
is audited um insured one to one and uh
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
so and that part of the feed that back
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
we got about the state depository in the
 
04:44:36.510 --> 04:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
electronic currency we took that to
 
04:44:38.430 --> 04:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
heart the complexity of it the the
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
capital investment and so we're leaning
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
more towards uh doing something like
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
electronic currencies through a
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
framework like representative Ammon says
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
where it's not the state currency it's a
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
private currency but there's a
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework that makes sure
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire residents are safe
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be a lot of
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
scams in this
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you will you take questions
 
04:45:03.070 --> 04:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
sure all right uh representative spear
 
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure has a question for you
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
or statement my question isn't really it
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
it could be directed to either one of
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
you I guess so we've talk I'll address
 
04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
it to you
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't like evaluating this based
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
on a philosophy that the United States
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
government's going to collapse or or any
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
of those things I I I can't do that I
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to do that so
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
what I did was I went and looked to find
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
out why are states doing it this is and
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
and not anything more complicated than
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill just within this
 
04:45:38.798 --> 04:45:40.670 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill just within this
framework

04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
framework
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay so I look around and I found 13
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
states some of which you've named and I
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
have a list of the others and then I
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
started looking at their bills and I
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
started looking and this was tedious and
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
I ran out of time after about four or
 
04:45:56.320 --> 04:45:59.430 align:start position:0%
I ran out of time after about four or
five

04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.670 --> 04:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
hours in every in every
 
04:46:06.030 --> 04:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
case it was a tax
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
avoidance effort in every case it was
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
quoted as I don't have to pay sales tax
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
on gold and I don't have to pay Capital
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
Gains state level capital gains tax on
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
gold and I don't have to pay intangible
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
tax on gold uh increasing at the state
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
level at the state level you still have
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
to pay it on the federal level you can't
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
get away from that and unfortunately
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
because the IRS recognizes which states
 
04:46:34.590 --> 04:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
do it they look at them pretty pretty
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
closely another
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue across those 13 states I made a
 
04:46:39.760 --> 04:46:41.310 align:start position:0%
issue across those 13 states I made a
little

04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
Matrix and every one of them have a mix
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
of capital gains tax sales tax income
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
tax and tangible
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
tax every one of them we have none of
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that so we don't get any of the benefit
 
04:46:59.070 --> 04:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
of why these other states were doing it
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
we don't pay any of these taxes we have
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
a vague in tangible tax interest in div
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
ends but that's being phased out we
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
don't pay a capital gains tax we don't
 
04:47:11.708 --> 04:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
pay a sales tax we're not getting a
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
benefit or at least as the reasons these
 
04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
states said they were doing
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
it okay so I I'm not clear after that it
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
just becomes an emotional
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
thing you want to respon to that um well
 
04:47:28.350 --> 04:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
I I would
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
certainly calling a question calling it
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
tax avoidance um you know if you have
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
$100 and you shove it under your
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
mattress you don't pay taxes on it the
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
only reason that gold goes up in dollar
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
terms is because they're inflating the
 
04:47:43.590 --> 04:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
currency so it's not a it's it's not a
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
capital game no I I I'm not I'm not
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
implying an avoidance I'm just saying
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's what the reasons they were giving
 
04:47:50.990 --> 04:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
is though they didn't have to pay those
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
taxes understood yeah and so so there is
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
the one clause in the the Clauses in the
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill that speak to taxes in New
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are largely irrelevant I agree
 
04:48:01.868 --> 04:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
um but business profits tax is not one
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
of them if you wanted to operate your
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
business business uh using gold and
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
silver right now you'd wind up paying a
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
big uh profit from that that you know
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
from the gold and silver you're holding
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
as it goes up in value as the dollar
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
inflates um so so it does have some
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
impact in New Hampshire because it would
 
04:48:23.708 --> 04:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
allow for businesses to operate with a
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
gold and silver as their you know their
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
their money um without having to be
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
subject to taxes based on on that
 
04:48:34.110 --> 04:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
um but it it's actually kind of a good
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
good point because yeah there may there
 
04:48:38.670 --> 04:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
may be motivations tax-wise in a lot of
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
other states um so you know this bill is
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire geared more towards
 
04:48:47.910 --> 04:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
philosophical but it's also as I said no
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
state has passed um something allowing
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
blockchain gold and Silver's currency
 
04:48:57.548 --> 04:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
that really is the solution um for for
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
People Like Us concerned about the
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
strength of the US dollar that is going
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
to be the solution um unfortunately it's
 
04:49:04.548 --> 04:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
fairly complicated we couldn't tackle it
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
all this year so we want to continue
 
04:49:08.190 --> 04:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
that discussion next year but um this
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
lays that the foundation for that you
 
04:49:12.868 --> 04:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
want to take over um oh I do want to
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
clarify I I I did not mean to infer
 
04:49:17.230 --> 04:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
collapse of the US government and I
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
agree with you I don't want to go there
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want that to happen I don't
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
think that's going to happen I'm talking
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
strictly about the currency and it may
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
not be a hard collapse of the currency
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
but um you know High rates of inflation
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
with low yields for bonds are going to
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
wipe out a lot of Pension funds and it's
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
going to cause it can cause a lot of
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
Calamity so that's that's my concern not
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
a collapse of the
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
government okay representative
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
zon well first of all I want to thank
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
you for your service in the military and
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
I know you hear that a lot and I know
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're a smart guy and good at what you
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
do if you taught at the Air Force
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
Academy and I appreciate all those
 
04:49:59.470 --> 04:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
things and God knows served as a state
 
04:50:01.470 --> 04:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
senator in New Hampshire for your
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
hundred bucks a year which has got to be
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
way more fun in this
 
04:50:07.948 --> 04:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
job but you really let the cat out of
 
04:50:10.270 --> 04:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
the bag and earlier in your statements
 
04:50:12.270 --> 04:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
and you've backtracked on it which is
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
respectable and understandable but what
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is really about is a lack of
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
faith in the government of the United
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
States ability to manage its
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
finances that's what we're really
 
04:50:27.670 --> 04:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
talking about that's pretty much and on
 
04:50:31.230 --> 04:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
the one hand I recognize that there are
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
issues I can certainly see in
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
econom in terms of economic history and
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
look down the pipeline and go it could
 
04:50:40.548 --> 04:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
go this way it could go that way I
 
04:50:43.948 --> 04:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
certainly do not support a list way too
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
long to get into in this room for things
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
that happened or happening in
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
Washington at the end of the day for the
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:50:57.430 --> 04:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to agree to this I think
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
only serves to further undermine the
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
full faith and credit of the United
 
04:51:05.470 --> 04:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
States and I can't do
 
04:51:09.628 --> 04:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
that that's it as um I I I appreciate
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
the question um I I think the way you're
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
phrasing is is good it's it's it's
 
04:51:16.910 --> 04:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrating some skepticism let me put
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
it that way of the US government to
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
handle its finances I think that's 100%
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
accurate and that's kind of what this
 
04:51:23.708 --> 04:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
bill is doing as a statement we're
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about you guys handling your
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
finances I hope that working with
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
represent of Ammon um on a blockchain
 
04:51:33.150 --> 04:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
gold we can come up we can have a
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
solution in New New Hampshire for that
 
04:51:36.990 --> 04:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
to provide people an alternative so I
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
think that's fair I honestly disagree
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
though say you saying you know I can't
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
go there like I am a veteran and um I
 
04:51:48.750 --> 04:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
think it's our duty to go there to say
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
we don't trust what you guys are doing
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
with your finances we're going to come
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
up with an alternative and for all 50
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
states to do this because the federal
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
government is not going to do it they
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
cannot they cannot break the promises
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
they made with Social Security they
 
04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
can't they can't they can't stop um and
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a crisis for them to
 
04:52:14.948 --> 04:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
change and that crisis is cause going to
 
04:52:17.070 --> 04:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
cause pain and suffering my sincere
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
desire is to stop that pain and
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
suffering and that's why we're pushing
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
legislation like this in in as many
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
states as we
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
can I think it's our duty not something
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
that we should be ashamed about um I I
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
have question a lot of foreign military
 
04:52:34.030 --> 04:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
involvement that does doesn't mean I'm
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
unpatriotic that means I care about the
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
veterans okay thank you representa Gibbs
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm not going to try and
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
argue the large issues with you because
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think you and I just don't see the
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
world the same way and there's no chance
 
04:52:52.270 --> 04:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
that we would ever agree but I have a
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
very specific question on the
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
information that you provided earlier
 
04:53:00.548 --> 04:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
you were talking about a federal law
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
that makes it a crime to present
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
I believe to present he's getting
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
sorry okay but let me finish my question
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes um yeah you're talking about a
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
federal law that makes it a crime to
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
present gold as money and you referenced
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
someone who was convicted and uh went to
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
jail for 5 years and then a little bit
 
04:53:28.470 --> 04:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
later you said a company was convicted
 
04:53:30.830 --> 04:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and companies can be convicted of
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
crimes but they don't go to jail so my
 
04:53:35.070 --> 04:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
question is which was it a person or a
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
company so it was uh Bernard barnat
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
House of the liberty dollar um it's
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually and I you know I was big into
 
04:53:45.310 --> 04:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
the gold and silver movement and I
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
didn't like what I saw from that um
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
so the the case hearing for that is
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
actually really really good in terms of
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
what they looked at and they looked at
 
04:53:55.760 --> 04:53:56.708 align:start position:0%
what they looked at and they looked at
USC

04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
USC
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
486 the questional of it was called into
 
04:54:03.230 --> 04:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
question by uh Gata the gold antitrust
 
04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
ass Association unfortunately the court
 
04:54:07.708 --> 04:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
did not rule on the constitutionality of
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
this statute because he also um like he
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
would do stuff like go to the store and
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
drop a coin into someone's hand and he
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
he basically he really tried to pass it
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
off as as US
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
currency and so USC 486 wasn't um called
 
04:54:27.788 --> 04:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
in the constitutionality wasn't called
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
into question even though it was
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
challenged but but what it says is
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
whoever except as authorized by law La
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
makes or utters or passes or attempts to
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
utter or pass any coins of gold or
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
silver or other metal or Alloys metal
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
intended for use as current money with
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
in the resemblance of us United States
 
04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
or foreign countries or of original
 
04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
design shall be find under this title or
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
imprison not more than five years or
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
both so in other words if I have a
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
silver Buffalo round and and I go to try
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
to spend it as money I can go to prison
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
for five years will that happen probably
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
not but it's on the books could you
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
speak into could you speak into the mic
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
please yeah so so my example is if
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone takes a you know a a buffalo and
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
takes it to the store and tries and you
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
know tries to spend it even if the other
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
person understands what it is and
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
accepts it uh by this statute they could
 
04:55:21.390 --> 04:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
be in prison for five years um and I
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that's an
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
issue I collect coins and as a result of
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
that I have a pot load of those Liberty
 
04:55:30.750 --> 04:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
coins uh they made every effort to make
 
04:55:32.430 --> 04:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
them look like they were real coins
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah I think that was the
 
04:55:36.350 --> 04:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
core of where this whole thing went
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
wrong the guy it was like a counterfeit
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
coin that's that's exactly right so USC
 
04:55:42.718 --> 04:55:44.310 align:start position:0%
coin that's that's exactly right so USC
486

04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
486
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
is that was a big discussion in the
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
courts is is this constitutional and
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
basically said well you know you there's
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
a well- established right to barter
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
which we've talked about you know so
 
04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
someone should be able to spend these
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
coins it was challenged constitutionally
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
but in the end there was definitely a
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
very counterfeit component to what he
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
was doing and so they did not rule on
 
04:56:10.190 --> 04:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
whether 486 was constitutional or not
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
but under 46 and he you
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
know I so he went to prison for
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
counterfeiting not for using gold never
 
04:56:21.868 --> 04:56:21.878 align:start position:0%
was in silver it was silver well Define
 
04:56:24.670 --> 04:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
counterfit if I have a a buffalo well if
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
the co if the court defined it as
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
counter fitting it was counter
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
fitting I'm I'm little don't understand
 
04:56:34.110 --> 04:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
how this has has anything to do with
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at here I I think
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're diving into the necessity for
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
this and I I brought your necessity was
 
04:56:41.708 --> 04:56:41.718 align:start position:0%
that there's another sentence it says
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
unless the state creat so unless
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
authorized by law this and this says
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
except as authorized by law this statute
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
does that um or this this bill would do
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
that and it would provide some
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
confidence for people that that's your
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
rationale for us that we can pass this
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill and not we be worried about the
 
04:57:01.230 --> 04:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
feds because this federal law allows no
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
we don't we're not we don't have to be
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
worried about the feds because of of you
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
know over a 100 Years of constitutional
 
04:57:10.628 --> 04:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
court cases um you know Lane uh the lane
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
case back in the 1860s says states have
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
a right to determine what is legal
 
04:57:18.670 --> 04:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
tender as long as it's gold or silver
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
states have that right that's been well
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
established that's not the question the
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
question is why do we need this and USC
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
486 is a part of why we need this I
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
think we also need it because you know
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
um as a sign that the state recognizes
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
is gold and silver is still money it is
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
a good way to preserve your purchasing
 
04:57:40.030 --> 04:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
power and um and we're concerned about
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government overspending and
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.150 --> 04:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
currency excuse me by gold correct but
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to use gold like if
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
you want to have your business start
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
using gold which you know PE people are
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do no I think they're just
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
saying that they're going to stash away
 
04:58:02.590 --> 04:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
gold yes for when the crisis occurs yes
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
that is a when the world comes to an end
 
04:58:06.510 --> 04:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
that they get their their room full of
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
gold and they're they're they're feeling
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay let's can we wrap this up I
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
will wrap it
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
up right I don't know representative giz
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
has her hand up were you gonna she's
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
only raising her hand up about five
 
04:58:22.270 --> 04:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
times and spoken out of turn I think if
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
well it's not never
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
mind this is a subcommittee this is a
 
04:58:29.548 --> 04:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we're not you can talk out
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
of order so yes go ahead and I'm
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee too yeah yes what would you
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
like to say never mind I'm just going to
 
04:58:38.310 --> 04:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
drop it no we want to hear it yeah I
 
04:58:40.750 --> 04:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
want to hear it well fine it's a
 
04:58:40.760 --> 04:58:41.830 align:start position:0%
want to hear it well fine it's a
political

04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
statement and what you what you're
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying basically is uh you're you're
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
worried about inflation and you're
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
worried about inflation and and that's
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
based on the I thought he was worried
 
04:58:58.110 --> 04:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
about the the the the national debt no
 
04:59:01.708 --> 04:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
no you're you're you're almost there the
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
worry about inflation goes right back to
 
04:59:06.270 --> 04:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
the national debt goes right back to the
 
04:59:08.788 --> 04:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
national debt okay now if you were to go
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
back and not pass Reagan's tax bill if
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
you were to go back and not pass George
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
W Bush's pass Bill if you're to go back
 
04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
and not P pass Trump's tax bill you
 
04:59:23.948 --> 04:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
would have a very very small deficit the
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
problem is is there's two sides to the
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
deficit one side is spending money and
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
one side is raising money and that's
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
what we fail to do and that's why we
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
have a deficit thank you actually I'm
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
glad you brought that point up to be
 
04:59:40.110 --> 04:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
honest um because that gets into
 
04:59:42.868 --> 04:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
partisanship to be clear I am not
 
04:59:45.150 --> 04:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
blaming one or the other party for
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
what's going on in DC it has been both
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
you've highlighted a lot of parts of
 
04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
that it has been both um it's also you
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
know fairly structural I mean it goes
 
04:59:56.990 --> 04:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
back a long ways the creation of the
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve has enabled us this is I
 
05:00:01.350 --> 05:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
am this is this should not be a
 
05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat issue it's a DC
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
versus a state issue in my
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
you and I say that despite my party
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
affiliation which I went and got when I
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
so yeah so what I think clearly this has
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
been a very engaging discussion the
 
05:00:34.190 --> 05:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee so so I I think an interim
 
05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
study motion is is
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay representative taxon
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative C moves uh
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
moves interim study and is there a way
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
to narrow it just to the amendment um
 
05:00:50.830 --> 05:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's the bill number so yeah
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
it can but in terms of the conversation
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
we can we when we take it up again we
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
could certainly say that stick to the
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
the narrow the narrow subject because it
 
05:01:01.948 --> 05:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
it certainly we can get our arms around
 
05:01:04.990 --> 05:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
it more than the big bill so interim
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
study what I would like to get out of it
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
I know maybe some people's eyes Glu is
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
over on this topic but I'm I'm very
 
05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
interested yeah I'm very interested but
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
um what the Dr presented uh today maybe
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
in our interm study focusing just on
 
05:01:20.030 --> 05:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
this limited Amendment we could dig into
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
a little more about how would we
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
implement it at at the diary level I'd
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
be interested in you know just kind of
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
learning more so but that narrow subject
 
05:01:29.070 --> 05:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
you you didn't really have did you have
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
an opinion on that only only in the
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
sense that someone was going to try to
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
pay ax tax bill with it right but isn't
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
there another side to that I mean what
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
happens when the state wants to use that
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
gold to buy the goods and services
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
convers let's no is that I think it's
 
05:01:43.948 --> 05:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
the same side that's for the interim
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
study we have a pending motion this is
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
discussion right now we're in we're in
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
discussion on the pending motion wants
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
to okay all
 
05:01:56.590 --> 05:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
you okay we have we have uh um a motion
 
05:02:04.990 --> 05:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
U to interim study the bill uh obviously
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
represent Amon opened up a little bit of
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
a can where I'm saying can we make sure
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
that the discussion is only around just
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment not the whole bill and
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
that certainly can be possible when we
 
05:02:19.708 --> 05:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
take up this uh bill um when we uh this
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
next September okay so is the motion
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
clear interim study all those in favor
 
05:02:24.840 --> 05:02:26.788 align:start position:0%
clear interim study all those in favor
say

05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
I four five six all those opposed I'm
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
GNA I'm going to post just because
 
05:02:36.350 --> 05:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
what what you didn't you made the motion
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
no no oh that's right than made the
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
that well we still have time to work on
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment and maybe we could get
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
something across the finish line but you
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
know it's the will of the
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee I I'm uh I'm uh I'm willing to
 
05:03:00.910 --> 05:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
go along with the will of committee but
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
right on the on the partis side we would
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
talk about how a couple of budgets were
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
pass under Biden that uh certainly added
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
deficit if you want to talk about
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
dispute

05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.920 --> 05:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
over

05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay it's only 3
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
yeah okay ribbons and elme you want to
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
here now you have already seen if you
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
bothered to read it yet the uh one that
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
I had in in red red letters in between
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
that I just wrote up myself and
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
distributed to everybody at the hearing
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
um this it is different in one way I
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
discovered when I went to talk with
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
oplc that there is no way they would
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
want us or we would want
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
them as a home for for the board that
 
05:04:51.150 --> 05:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get and uh they they
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
wanted said that if they got it they
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
would have to license everything the
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
only only thing to licens is the
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
property managers there are only a few
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
of and they'd probably fight back quite
 
05:05:08.070 --> 05:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
hard uh and it wouldn't do much good
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
just to license them so um so I uh tried
 
05:05:16.270 --> 05:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of other places the housing
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
appeals board is too new to take
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
anything on an attachment but uh Das as
 
05:05:28.548 --> 05:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
a whole has agreed to uh take on the
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
board as an attached board they have
 
05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
four others still now that the the
 
05:05:37.708 --> 05:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board left uh to become
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
its own
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
unit and it costs more to become your
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
own unit
 
05:05:51.310 --> 05:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
um this um so the last part of this
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
um line 7 to
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
23 of page
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
two and and
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is a um putting it in
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
administrative services and providing an
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation from labor grade 19 which
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
I actually don't know if is too high or
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
not because that came from opls it's
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
they had asked for four Personnel three
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
of whom were highlevel investigators and
 
05:06:34.270 --> 05:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh and a administrator who would
 
05:06:37.708 --> 05:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
be labor board 19 I don't know if you
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
can do with labor board 17 I don't know
 
05:06:44.590 --> 05:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
anything about these things so I I would
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
hope that at if this passed that at some
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
point someone would change that to
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
whatever is appropriate since it is an
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
early bill because of the oplc request
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
for 300
 
05:07:01.708 --> 05:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
something, uh labor board 19 labor grade
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
19 for their uh from their perspective
 
05:07:09.548 --> 05:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
costs 80,000 which is about what we'd
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
been calculating last term it would cost
 
05:07:19.110 --> 05:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
to get but we were looking at a a
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
administrator who would only do certain
 
05:07:24.350 --> 05:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
tasks that I'd forgotten are also in
 
05:07:24.360 --> 05:07:25.270 align:start position:0%
tasks that I'd forgotten are also in
this

05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.080 --> 05:07:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
specifying

05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
specifying
 
05:07:31.320 --> 05:07:35.670 align:start position:0%
specifying
um

05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
specifying somewhere oh I I think they
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
were in what I was just talking
 
05:07:40.480 --> 05:07:44.510 align:start position:0%
were in what I was just talking
about

05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:47.470 --> 05:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
um specifying that the board
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
administrator this is on page two lines
 
05:07:55.548 --> 05:07:55.558 align:start position:0%
9 to 12 um the board of the de
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
05:08:00.150 --> 05:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
shall assign a board administrator to
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
receive complaints forward them to the
 
05:08:05.788 --> 05:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
board file minutes and reports and place
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Certified Abstract of each final
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
decision on a public website created for
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose and and then the department
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
shall maintain the
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
records um that is all that this board
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
would need in the way of
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
money and it comes to maybe
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
$80,000 a year so um that's a lot
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
different from
 
05:08:40.230 --> 05:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
what OPC was asking for but they were
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
contemplating taking over the entire
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
process and not even they didn't need a
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
board H did you say was taking over
 
05:08:53.350 --> 05:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
what's the well office of professional
 
05:08:56.110 --> 05:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
yes professional lure and certification
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
they were not I thought you took them
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
out we did I did take them I that's what
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying who is who is now going to be
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
the administrator of this program uh
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Department
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
administrative Services yes and I've got
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
that from the head of the department and
 
05:09:13.680 --> 05:09:15.390 align:start position:0%
that from the head of the department and
who's

05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
who's
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
that you're talking to someone who
 
05:09:20.350 --> 05:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
forgets the name of her own sister when
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
she's asked a question well you know you
 
05:09:25.390 --> 05:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
know who he's been there a long time
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry at this point uh I've had
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
office of administrative Services said
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
that they're more than welcome to
 
05:09:42.670 --> 05:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're more than to take on yeah and
 
05:09:44.910 --> 05:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
they have a hearings officer and the and
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner and um the woman
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
who sent it for them said and so this
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is that people pay $500 to come in
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
and tell their Horror Story to the about
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
their condo uh well this is within a
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
specific the way the model that we're
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
working from worked was that people
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
would send something
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
to to the board administrator the board
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
administrator would look at them and if
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
it had absolutely nothing to do with
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
governance or
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
voting or um getting the minutes done on
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
time not even getting a minute well
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
unless you consider that governance but
 
05:10:36.750 --> 05:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
they they would wipe out any any pink
 
05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
flamingos and then they would send the
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
packet to the board and the board meets
 
05:10:46.350 --> 05:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
and it looks through the packet and it
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
decides no we've already done minutes on
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
time and throws that one out and um and
 
05:10:59.470 --> 05:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
then comes across another one in which
 
05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh they haven't had an election in the
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
last 10
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
years for the
 
05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
board and decides that maybe they'll
 
05:11:10.510 --> 05:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
take that
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
one and so they're going to look filing
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
or someone pays the $500 first or yes
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
they pay the $500 still that check is
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
sitting there and the check gets cash
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then they can decide whether they
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
want to take on the case or not right
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
and then theoretically they could say no
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
and the person's out $500s yes exactly
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
and that's partly to keep out the Pink
 
05:11:36.990 --> 05:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
Flamingos but it's partly also because P
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
flamingos government kind of wants more
 
05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
money to go in for things like this so
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
it would cost less than 80,000 in the
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
end so who are these people who are
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to be making this is who's this
 
05:11:51.070 --> 05:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
board uh so I have to look in the
 
05:11:53.948 --> 05:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
original Bill the board was in the
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
right uh that one would be by the
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
governor uh they're almost all got by
 
05:12:09.150 --> 05:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
the governor actually two members of the
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives appointed by
 
05:12:13.470 --> 05:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
the speaker three members appointed by
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
the governor who are resident owners of
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
condominiums in um New Hampshire and
 
05:12:23.708 --> 05:12:23.718 align:start position:0%
three from different executive I I have
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
modified that statement to specify
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
resident owner unit owners of
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
condominium so they aren't resident
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
owners of condom the whole
 
05:12:38.030 --> 05:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
condominium right uh and that said
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
neither members jury of the PE peers
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
because these are just no well that's
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
just part of it then two members
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor who are
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
members of a Condominium Association
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
board and from different executive
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
council districts one member appointed
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
by the governor who represents a
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association Management
 
05:13:02.830 --> 05:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
Company um from a list of three persons
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
from the community association's
 
05:13:08.110 --> 05:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
Institute one member and one member of
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
appointed by the president of
 
05:13:13.230 --> 05:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
Association how many board members do we
 
05:13:14.910 --> 05:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
have all
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
total five seven nine that's what I
 
05:13:19.628 --> 05:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
thought it
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
was it's nine they wouldn't all show up
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
each time
 
05:13:26.000 --> 05:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
each time
presumably

05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
05:13:30.990 --> 05:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
but right well like the med panel most
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
most of these usually just three people
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
nine seems like a humongous crowd but
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay well it gives you the opportunity
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
when you've got three people who aren't
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
being paid if you if one of them doesn't
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
show up you're in trouble if two of them
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
don't show up you're dead well no I'm
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
not even thinking you're you're you're
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to be agreed upon that the three
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
people are pointed are the ones are
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to show up yeah and that's like
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's the med panel that I was that I
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
was involved so the thing that bus me
 
05:14:05.310 --> 05:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
the most about this amendment is on page
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
two right at the
 
05:14:10.750 --> 05:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
top in the event either party TRS to
 
05:14:13.150 --> 05:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
subbly F challenging the final decision
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
the count such right shall not be
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
infringed and the board shall be
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
represented by the Department of Justice
 
05:14:23.350 --> 05:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
that was well actually that's a hybrid
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh the first part of that was asked of
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Me by the head of the consumer
 
05:14:28.920 --> 05:14:30.030 align:start position:0%
Me by the head of the consumer
protection

05:14:30.030 --> 05:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
board the second part of it I
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
added but I am also here before you
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
trying to get another week so that I can
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
go back and talk with the the person who
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
has replaced the head of the consumer
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
protection board who is on leave for two
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
months all of a sudden uh with um on go
 
05:14:58.750 --> 05:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
through the things that he said here
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
Brandon yeah Brandon Brandon he's on
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
he's on on leave for he's on leave for I
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
think it's two months Family Leave yeah
 
05:15:09.310 --> 05:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
could be I don't know I hadn't known he
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
was going to but it may be why he called
 
05:15:14.110 --> 05:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
me up on a Sunday okay now I remember it
 
05:15:15.868 --> 05:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't that paragraph which is that
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
pretty it's pretty outrageous too but it
 
05:15:19.868 --> 05:15:19.878 align:start position:0%
was the one before it in the event that
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
the decision the cond dispute resol is
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
disregarded by one of the
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
parties okay now this isn't surprise to
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
me because I'm you know I'm assuming
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
that that that's going to be the condo
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
association itself yes is going to say
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is they don't play after C file
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the court the gree May appeal to
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
the court for
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay now I thought the whole
 
05:15:44.548 --> 05:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
point of this thing was so that we could
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
avoid going to Superior Court the whole
 
05:15:52.110 --> 05:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
point of it was to try to get to a try
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
to avoid going to Superior Court but
 
05:15:59.070 --> 05:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
when they do go to Superior Court there
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
are decisions of the that board that the
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
judge can depend on because most of the
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
judges have a really hard time dealing
 
05:16:07.080 --> 05:16:08.030 align:start position:0%
judges have a really hard time dealing
with

05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
Condominiums which shouldn't surprise
 
05:16:15.390 --> 05:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's can we interim study this bill and
 
05:16:19.628 --> 05:16:19.638 align:start position:0%
you can work on it and you can bring it
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.750 --> 05:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
year you promise I can bring it back
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
next year what's that if you're chair
 
05:16:29.070 --> 05:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
can you promise I can bring it back you
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
always bring it back next year doesn't
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
mean I'll pass said but you know
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
bringing it back but it feels like you
 
05:16:37.750 --> 05:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
realize how often we have the the the
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
bill before I started amending it with
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
um the various parties that I've just
 
05:16:49.470 --> 05:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
named yeah on on was the bill that Ned
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
Gordon finished amending in
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
2020 and what happened to that uh Co we
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
passed it in the
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
house uh the I think before we closed
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
down and were told to go home very
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
carefully at 5:00 a.m.
 
05:17:17.070 --> 05:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
yes right and on it we did actually have
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
a great deal of interest that year in
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
the senate in passing it but uh the
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
Senate closed down shortly after we did
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
and they would have needed a public
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
hearing I didn't even ask them I knew
 
05:17:34.110 --> 05:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.430 --> 05:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
here so it
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
died got it and and that was the
 
05:17:43.150 --> 05:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
original bill that you put in today uh
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
that would no the original bill yeah the
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
original bill I put in how many weeks
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
ago was it now yeah right
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
1645 right as introduced as
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
introduced but uh at that point we
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
didn't realize they were going to
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
totally change
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
oplc so that this couldn't go there the
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board had gone
 
05:18:12.270 --> 05:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
there had been there the whole time and
 
05:18:15.390 --> 05:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
um and and they shut it down because no
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
cases you know no cases
 
05:18:20.548 --> 05:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
occurred that's what I heard but
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
somebody here was telling me yeah that
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
somebody came back with a request that
 
05:18:32.910 --> 05:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
you started up again yes
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if they're the same
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
people who were
 
05:18:40.350 --> 05:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
complaining yes about the New Hampshire
 
05:18:42.030 --> 05:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
Community Loan
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
Fund representative Al me last year I
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
just want to say I admire your tenacity
 
05:18:50.190 --> 05:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
on this issue you I think uh I served
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
with you uh I think last term on the in
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh on the uh condominium study committee
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah and I know you've been
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly on this issue so I I
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh admire your your well I did it took
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
me 11 years to get prevention and
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
treatment along with with representative
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
Welsh and representative th on into the
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
drunk driving laws and rationalize the
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
drunk driving laws that was a joint
 
05:19:21.958 --> 05:19:23.070 align:start position:0%
drunk driving laws that was a joint
effort

05:19:23.070 --> 05:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
though and in this case every every year
 
05:19:30.030 --> 05:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
new people come on the study committee
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
which is going away next next year now
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
um so everybody will be calling
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
me since there won't be anybody left to
 
05:19:39.520 --> 05:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
me since there won't be anybody left to
call

05:19:43.270 --> 05:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
Will you're here he's got some
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge now
 
05:19:50.590 --> 05:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah but his name isn't quite as
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
well known in condo
 
05:19:55.430 --> 05:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
circles at this point I thought I fix
 
05:19:57.708 --> 05:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
that problem if we stayed if we stayed
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
together longer maybe it would
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
be but the Attorney General's office for
 
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
a while was sending us these things
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
because they can't do anything about it
 
05:20:11.868 --> 05:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
and they know that it's a problem and
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
they've reserved this
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
year and they um and said that they'd
 
05:20:23.948 --> 05:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
really like to help with us if we pass
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
it but you know as you know you know I'm
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
not saying anything new to you that when
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
if I had a grievance
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
against uh my town mhm which for all
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
tense of purposes that's what a condo
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
association is it's it's a town a town
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
and if I have a grievance you know the
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
the end result is if I can either run
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
for office and and knock somebody out
 
05:20:52.510 --> 05:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
and if I can't win if I can't convince
 
05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
my constitu other neighbors that you
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
know that that um we have a problem and
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
they elect those bad apples the only
 
05:21:08.590 --> 05:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
town yeah and you've got enough money to
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
do it uh that's
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
maybe woman who was in talking 10 times
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
10 but if I have enough money I probably
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
would win the election because I you
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
know yeah I spend enough money to win
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
right so however yeah how how do we how
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
do we reconcile the difference how do we
 
05:21:36.430 --> 05:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
reconcile that at the end of the day
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
that yes if you have a if the town is
 
05:21:40.350 --> 05:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
violating some laws you take them to
 
05:21:43.470 --> 05:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it's the same deal and
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
and I hear you about finding lawyers who
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
willing to take the case and I assume
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
the why most lawyers don't want to take
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
the case is because they've always
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
lost you know that the end of the day
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
when you go to Superior Court the court
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
is going to favor you know the the
 
05:22:02.350 --> 05:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
system well that's an interesting
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
question since didario was claiming that
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
the court favors the individual unit
 
05:22:13.390 --> 05:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
owner that comes before them I never
 
05:22:16.030 --> 05:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
heard that before right by the way I've
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
called up uh managed to talk with five
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the people on that list of eight that
 
05:22:28.270 --> 05:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
he gave you and um the big law firms
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
totally I'm not including them because
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
they they totally say that they have no
 
05:22:36.150 --> 05:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
idea they don't know anything about cond
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
La they don't they don't know anything
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
about anybody there that works with
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
condo LA but they may may have taken a
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
case at some point they don't
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
know probably the other side one of them
 
05:22:49.390 --> 05:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
told me that she um what you guys want
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%

05:22:54.730 --> 05:22:54.740 align:start position:0%

oh I'm sorry you were hiding over there
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't think you wanted to say I was
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
trying to drag you into the
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
conversation by the way did I give you
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%

Amendment

05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%

I'm the chairman of the labor committee
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
and for some reason the speaker is angry
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
with me and made me the uh chairman of
 
05:23:53.788 --> 05:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
the condo and homeowners association or
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
board committee thing
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
there over the years I have come and
 
05:24:00.190 --> 05:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
testify in front of the Commerce
 
05:24:01.868 --> 05:24:01.878 align:start position:0%
Committee a number of times and I have
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
been opposed to uh this um dispute
 
05:24:08.430 --> 05:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
resolution board because I didn't think
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
it had any teeth and the numbers didn't
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
quite quite match up who was going to do
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
it what was the fee going to be and some
 
05:24:16.750 --> 05:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
of these other things so sitting on this
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee I I don't want to say I'm I've
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
softened a bit but I've listened to some
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
things that are kind of disturbing I
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
have sat on four or five different
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
condominium boards over the years
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
difficult things uh million dooll fires
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of other stuff where I cut
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
my teeth and learned everything about U
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
condo law and and condo
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
documents um without question there are
 
05:24:41.070 --> 05:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
people that will never be happy with
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
anything they'll never be happy with
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
their neighbors their Association the
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
color of flowers that were planted in
 
05:24:49.470 --> 05:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
the spring so the concern was that
 
05:24:52.470 --> 05:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
people are who are um antagonists are
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
just going to overrun this committee uh
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
or this dispute resolution board with a
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
bunch of of things that are just
 
05:25:01.708 --> 05:25:01.718 align:start position:0%
nonsensical but there have been some
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
things that we have heard that shouldn't
 
05:25:06.548 --> 05:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
be going
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
on uh heavy-handedness by property
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
managers not providing um standard
 
05:25:16.270 --> 05:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
documents you know you want to look at
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
the plowing contract or the landscape
 
05:25:21.868 --> 05:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
contract and and that the board approves
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's supposed to be transparent
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to see these things
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
minutes that don't come out for 6 months
 
05:25:28.990 --> 05:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
at a time
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
um uh not having elections arguing about
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
proxies and and you know I've seen it
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
all uh and and now i' I've
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
um had testimony to some of these things
 
05:25:49.310 --> 05:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
so I would like to find an appropriate
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh having not seen really the
 
05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
the the amendment wanting to go through
 
05:25:54.750 --> 05:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the attorney General doesn't want to
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
deal with it Mr chairman I I know your
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
opinion if you don't like it leave or
 
05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
get on the board and fix it which is
 
05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
what I did a number of times um so I I
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
wish there was a a better mechanism I
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
think each time representative Aly
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
brings something it gets better and
 
05:26:21.510 --> 05:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
better um
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
I I think I would having not really
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
looked at this and massage this thing
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
she was correct she was throwing a she
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
was she was throwing a big curveball
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
with oplc this year to no fault of her
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
own um this last uh month
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
um with with this ridiculous
 
05:26:42.240 --> 05:26:44.670 align:start position:0%
um with with this ridiculous
expense

05:26:44.670 --> 05:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
expense
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
I don't like one of the things I heard
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
but again it's it's it's it's something
 
05:26:50.990 --> 05:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
that can be worked out I don't have the
 
05:26:53.910 --> 05:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
perfect answer there is definitely there
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
are definitely a few issues are are they
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
Monumental are we going to have hundreds
 
05:27:01.150 --> 05:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
of people come into the to this dispute
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
resolution uh probably not are there a
 
05:27:04.830 --> 05:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
couple that are going to hold some
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
people's feet to the fire yes does it
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
have the teeth it really needs probably
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
not um and um would I like to see a
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
sunset just in case it doesn't work
 
05:27:20.670 --> 05:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
yes um so um I know I just threw you a
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of non-committal
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
stuff but there are some things out
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
there that need to be dealt with and I'm
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
not sure how to handle them I move that
 
05:27:58.670 --> 05:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment so instead of of doing it next
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.440 --> 05:28:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
thought

05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
thought
 
05:28:21.868 --> 05:28:21.878 align:start position:0%
um it was going to finance because
 
05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:31.948 --> 05:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
$380,000 yeah it would still go to it
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
would still go to
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
finance and at this point it wouldn't
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
some
