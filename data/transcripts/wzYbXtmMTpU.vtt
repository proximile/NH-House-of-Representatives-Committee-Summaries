i do not know why
 
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
i do not know why
this

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
relative to motorcycle warner's permit
 
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
relative to motorcycle warner's permit
uh

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
do do you know why
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
well we're looking for all sides of the
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
i yeah there you go
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
got it uh larry crowe from the division
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
of motor vehicles uh the reason is the
 
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
current law only allows for one in a
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
lifetime it is entirely possible
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody could get a motorcycle permit
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it could rain oh and it's only good
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
for 45 days
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
it could rain for those 45 days
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
putting people in a difficult situation
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
so this would allow for a
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
second time for them to be able to get
 
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.909 align:start position:0%
second time for them to be able to get
it

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
is that basically the only addition to
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
the bill or the only gist of the bill uh
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
to my understanding is reading it yes it
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
it just provides for that uh
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
that means um when you apply for your
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
first motorcycle permit you should be
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
pretty serious and
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
get it done uh assuming that your
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
motorcycle permit is intended to lead
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
toward a motorcycle license
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's your 45-day window to make it
 
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
that's your 45-day window to make it
happen

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes you can lose your motorcycle license
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
and you can get you do not have to have
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
a permit in order to get a motorcycle
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
license the motorcycle permit allows you
 
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:35.909 align:start position:0%
license the motorcycle permit allows you
to

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
to
legally

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
legally
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
operate on
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
the roadways of the state
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
the intention there is to a get practice
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
and be able to
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
learn what you need to do and then to
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
legally get to the
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
to the dmv and test out however there
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
are other ways around it that you could
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
and representative thank you thank you
 
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.749 align:start position:0%
and representative thank you thank you
um

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
in our fiscal note it says that this is
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
expected to be uh there's going to be a
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
one-time cost of 28 000. could you
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'm the motorcycle guy
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
i run motorcycle rider training um i can
 
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.629 align:start position:0%
i run motorcycle rider training um i can
however

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
it does require an adjustment and
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
retooling of our computers right now
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a hard stop if anybody's ever
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
had a permit and they come in and try to
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
apply to for another one
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
the system's going to deny them so
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's an adjustment to that i'm so i'm
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
guessing that is part of it i'm going to
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
emphasize that word guessing
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
and also some of our forms may have to
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
be updated and regraded so um it would
 
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.950 align:start position:0%
be updated and regraded so um it would
be

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
the the change in the law would require
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
us to do some one-time
 
00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
us to do some one-time
work

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks for the
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
question um i'm not going to ask you
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether you support or oppose this but i
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
will ask do you see this as a reasonable
 
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
will ask do you see this as a reasonable
accommodation

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
for motorcycle
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that um
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
in my office motorcycle rider training
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
we do regularly get phone calls from
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
people who have had a permit in the past
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
and now can't get one and are in a
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of a quandary as to where to
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
as a result of a time crunch and the
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
limitation of the 45 days yes some many
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
didn't realize they got one before and
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
this was oh yeah that's right or as i
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
said the you know whether uh
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances beyond their control
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
something like that so um
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
i do hear from the public that they
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
would like another shot at a motorcycle
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes you can uh um
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes you can uh let's go with a
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
scenario where
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
a resident has good considers himself to
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
have good motorcycle skills and does own
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle they can make an
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
appointment to
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
take the skills test
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
and as long as they legally get their
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
motorcycle to us
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh which could be trailering it there or
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
having a friend ride it then they hop on
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
it on our private you know in our closed
 
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
it on our private you know in our closed
circuit

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they've passed it uh
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
they're then good to go uh what can't
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
happen is they can't um fail the test
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
then hop on their motorcycle and we
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
watch them right away
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's uh um as i like to tell them
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh the written test is the test that's
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.600 --> 00:10:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
there definitely is another way for that
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
to happen and that is to go through
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider training uh where we
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
provide the motorcycle and all the
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
instruction and at the conclusion of it
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
also administer the skill test which if
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
passed allows them to get their
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
motorcycle endorsement or motorcycle
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
no we pay them it's a big responsibility
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
as the state coordinator of motorcycle
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
rider training i'm going to say that um
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
i do believe that is one of the
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
the absolute best ways to go ahead and
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
do that however there is the other
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
option which is absolutely allowed in
 
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
option which is absolutely allowed in
law

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
allowed in law
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
there is not we there are states that
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
are mandatory training on new hampshire
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
is not one of
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
pass this bill but if we first amend the
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
bill and take out the 25 at 28 000
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and give you
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
permission to have the additional
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
permit time in place
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
permit time in place
um

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
how horrible would it be for your agency
 
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.829 align:start position:0%
how horrible would it be for your agency
no

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a budget year um so um would
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
you be able to go forward
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
without the 28 000.
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i i apologize uh representative
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
i'm just the motorcycle i understand and
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
when i say jest actually i think it's
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
pretty cool but that's okay i understand
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
you notice this hair is all messed up
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
from riding his motorcycle over here
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
today it's a lovely day
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me and this is the permanent
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
anybody else
oh

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray um in
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
lieu of the 28 000 um is there a
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
possibility what is the fee for a
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
motorcycle permit and to extend the
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
permit is there
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
would there be a possibility to add a
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
ten dollar fee or something on top of
 
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
ten dollar fee or something on top of
that

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.069 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
again i can't speak a lot to the money
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
go around the um i can tell you that the
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
permit is a uh thirty dollar fee right
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
now which is i believe broken down by
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
it's actually twenty five dollars plus
 
00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:03.910 align:start position:0%
it's actually twenty five dollars plus
five

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
um that five dollar uh fee does go to
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
help fund the motorcycle rider training
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
program goes directly to it um i believe
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
if i read if i read this correctly i'm
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not a financial expert like you
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
folks are but i believe the permit is uh
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
the extension is the same it looks to me
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
like another 25
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
and possibly the plus five
 
00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
and possibly the plus five
um

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.269 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry i lost track of the actual
 
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry i lost track of the actual
question

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes there is the the renewal is not
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
a uh uh felis there is there is it's
 
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.069 align:start position:0%
a uh uh felis there is there is it's
just

00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
it says in there that is revenue is
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
unknown because we've never done this
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
before so
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's very anecdotal for me to have an
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
opinion as far as how many do it we
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
could have a tremendous amount we could
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
have hardly anybody so i believe that is
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
why the the future revenue is unknown
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any anyone else
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
is the current
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
it went from 50 to 60. i believe that
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
was ten dollars
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
okay so real id is currently 60. okay
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.949 align:start position:0%
 
pardon

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
pardon
okay

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then it says
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
for each
 
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
for each
use

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
youth operators license and examination
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
ten dollars per year
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 50.
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.110 align:start position:0%
you don't
so

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'll try to speak loudly so everything
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
so everything you see there is not being
 
00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
so everything you see there is not being
changed

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so what do motorcycle learner permits
 
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.069 align:start position:0%
so so what do motorcycle learner permits
cost

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
cost
today

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
it is currently thirty dollars um and
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
then that thirty dollars
 
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.949 align:start position:0%
then that thirty dollars
does

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
move pay forward for the endorsement
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
assuming that the uh the citizen
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
trent moves the permit into a
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
into an endorsement as a result of
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
successful testing that thirty dollars
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
goes forward
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so there's not an additional fee at that
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
point that thirty dollars is pay early
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
or pay late but it's a one-time fee okay
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking for is that
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
get your license within the time frame
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
then in order to renew it it would cost
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
you 25 more
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
as i read this i do believe that that's
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
it i don't see the additional
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
five dollar
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
fee in here
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
um which would bring it up to 30 but
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
under methodology it does say for an
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
additional fee of 30. so i believe it's
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
25 plus 5
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the 25 is for the permit and then
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
it was when um 263 334b was which is
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider training rsa
 
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.949 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider training rsa
uh

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
it was baked into that
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
that this program would be funded by a
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
variety of motorcycle use
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
and the license was part of that which
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
helps fund this
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
the program is prime is pretty much
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
self-funding by motorcyclists in the
 
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
self-funding by motorcyclists in the
state

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
so somewhere there's that five dollars
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
well it's not brought up to the 30
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
because it says 25.
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm looking at the methodology
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
yeah you folks are much better about the
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the five dollars is um
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
in on line 23 there's a reference to
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
original driver's license issues five
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
dollars is credited to driver training
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
that doesn't pertain to the motorcycle
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh i guess that as i look at this or
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
thought about it
 
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
thought about it
that

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
since it's a renewal
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
you've already paid the five bucks
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
and so all we're doing is
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
renewing it
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
for yes mickey 263 34i
 
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.669 align:start position:0%
for yes mickey 263 34i
uh

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh
says

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.150 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
if i interpret this correctly what we're
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
saying is you've paid the five dollars
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
for your per um
 
00:18:48.720 --> 00:19:03.990 align:start position:0%
for your per um
um

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:20.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be 30 then it'd be 25 plus
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
the five dollars which is
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
assessed to any new permit or renewal or
 
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
assessed to any new permit or renewal or
license

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
currently for the basic rider course
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is the one we've been talking
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
about which leads to the possibility of
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
getting an endorsement that fee is 155
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
getting an endorsement that fee is 155
dollars

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:49.510 align:start position:0%
okay
sorry

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think the next thing on whoops that's
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
which is uh relative to
 
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.390 align:start position:0%
which is uh relative to
pfas

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%

uh

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%

i know
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:43.590 align:start position:0%

well except this one uh
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative mooney's going to come in
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
and tell us there's no physical impact
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing yeah
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
that could be
yeah

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
interesting

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:41.669 align:start position:0%
sure
yep

00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
i own two and i've been writing since a
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
teenager so
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
i look at this and i see this as kind of
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
like yeah let's just do it it's pretty
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
easy i agree
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay well then
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
would we like to yes mickey
 
00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
would we like to yes mickey
yeah

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
i we're gonna have to get you a mic over
 
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:52.310 align:start position:0%
i we're gonna have to get you a mic over
there

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify the fiscal impact of
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
this there's no appropriation here so
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's no new 28 thousand dollars being
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
drawn from anywhere so this would come
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
out of the department of safety's
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
current budget that you've already
 
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
current budget that you've already
adopted

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
so just so you know and 28 thousand
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
dollars in dmv's budget is not
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
substantial so i'm just gonna
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
just throw that out there and i can give
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
you their total budget if that helps but
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify this was not a
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
of order i guess would be more
 
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.950 align:start position:0%
of order i guess would be more
appropriate

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate
um

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer since this is
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
classified as a division work session
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
can we vote we can

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
why did i
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
well first of all we weren't supposed to
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
meet tuesday wednesday and thursday when
 
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:48.310 align:start position:0%
meet tuesday wednesday and thursday when
we

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's gone
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
i thought we it would be a good idea if
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
no that was all moved to monday
 
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
no that was all moved to monday
those

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah those are the um
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
education bills that we have to uh
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
i think it would take too much time that
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
was part of the
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
that was part of the problem
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i didn't want to have you come in at
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
two o'clock on friday afternoon
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's that's what i thought
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.190 align:start position:0%
as well
so

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we scheduled that's why i
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled them for monday so that
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is establishing the law
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%

the commission that crafted this bill
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
we did not deal with the appropriation
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:28.890 align:start position:0%

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
was largely crafted by
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
director skipper and then the folks from
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%

at least
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here from police
 
00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here from police
standards

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.230 align:start position:0%
i should have known that director
yeah

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
or at least sponsor willingly sponsored
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
the the bill so sit down thank you yeah
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty informal in here
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
unlike um
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
what i would call regular hearings that
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
are are held over in the big room
 
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
are are held over in the big room
um

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're in we're in the little room and
 
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
we're in we're in the little room and
it's

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:45.430 align:start position:0%
it's
so

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
i uh i really appreciate it and i know i
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
have met you before and i apologize for
 
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
have met you before and i apologize for
not

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
recognizing you
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair uh we we've only met once
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
before and it was right after my coved
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
shot on zoom so i uh i might have
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
appeared a little foggy on the on the
 
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
appeared a little foggy on the on the
screen

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess that what we want to
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
really focus in on um
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that all of us have read the
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
leak report
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
and are aware of uh
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
all of the things that
 
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.149 align:start position:0%
all of the things that
the

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
commission was trying to do to
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
sort out what's going on in the in the
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
police and i know that there's a process
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
right now that's going on
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
for people that are on the uh
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
i call it the lorry list which is not
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the right name it's some esculpatory
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
something or other
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i guess that
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
i apologize oh that's quite right
 
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:54.830 align:start position:0%
i apologize oh that's quite right
um

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.269 align:start position:0%
it's okay
um

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
i guess that what this is trying to do
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
what we used to do is we used to have a
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
little jar up at the front
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
our board
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
at the pilots union and whenever that
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
happened the individual had to put ten
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
dollars into the pot
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then it was uh donated
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
worthy charity i i
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
i absolutely am ready to pull the wallet
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
out but at the same time i gotta check
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
with the minister of finance at home to
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
see if i can afford that
 
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
see if i can afford that
[Laughter]

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
so as i read this this is pretty much
 
00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:46.470 align:start position:0%
so as i read this this is pretty much
formalizing

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
formalizing
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
what has been going on in the past
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh that is correct madam chair it really
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh while the title of this
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh bill speaks directly to the
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
misconduct piece
 
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.789 align:start position:0%
misconduct piece
that

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
really the overarching effort here was
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
to contemporize
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh the business at hand in the business
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
that we have been conducting uh since
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
our inception in 1971.
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
so it really does kind of uh bring us uh
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know into
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh the present the present times
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and including
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
that it also establishes this misconduct
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
review committee
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
that would be responsible for
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
responding to these types of allegations
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%

00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
overview um pertaining the
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
i guess or the not exactly controversial
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
but concerns about privacy and with the
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
list you're referencing about what does
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
the public what does the public get to
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
know and what does the public not get to
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
know with regards to a police infraction
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
of some kind well you thank you very
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
much for the question representative
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
murray uh in fact uh there has been uh
 
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.750 align:start position:0%
murray uh in fact uh there has been uh
really

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
a significant change in that particular
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
area and it those changes have occurred
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
through legislation
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
the governor has signed a bill that has
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
already gone through to
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
make our disciplinary hearing process a
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
public process it's open to the public
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
documents that are presented during
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
those hearings are also made public
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
on top of that there was a recent
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
decision that was issued by judge
 
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
decision that was issued by judge
schulman

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
schulman
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
relative to a lawsuit that was levied by
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
the manchester union leader and the aclu
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
against police standards and training
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
and in that ruling the judge
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
really provided even greater guidance
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
our responsibility
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
to balance the interests of the officer
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
versus the public
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
interests that would be attached to
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
whatever we were listening to in terms
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
of a hearing
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
there are certain cases where
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
a hearing which should be public and it
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
may involve discipline
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
would cross into those areas that would
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
be considered more of a private matter
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
let's say a police officer was arrested
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
for dwi
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact that dwi was really just
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh the unfortunate truth is discipline
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh disciplinary actions often are the
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
first signs of of a substance issue or a
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
mental health issue right
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
and it only comes to light because the
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
officer was caught driving drunk
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
so in a case like that uh
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
the the officer who is subject to the
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
hearing can
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh make a request to be heard in
 
00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
uh make a request to be heard in
non-public

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the council
 
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.390 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the council
that

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to talk about
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
really is more of a private nature to
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
include medical care
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care substance abuse
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
things of that nature uh also if there
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
is a an issue that may involve innocent
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
third parties or children you know we
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
would we would certainly look at that uh
 
00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:16.710 align:start position:0%
would we would certainly look at that uh
and

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure the council would rule that
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
those are privacy issues that would
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
outweigh the public interest
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
now we also
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
are very ready to
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
listen to the officer and in fact they
 
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
listen to the officer and in fact they
don't

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
make a prevailing argument that the
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
privacy interest outweighs the public
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
interest then the council will go to a
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
public session
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly any documents that are
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
circulated during that public session
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
are made
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
i know due process especially under 91a
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
i mean if you're i know on the school
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
board you can ask for public hearing
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
but this almost requires a public
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
hearing i mean how do you how do you
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
differentiate that
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
that fine line
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
it it really is according to judge
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
shulman it is very much a case-by-case
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
situation and it is uh
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
it really falls on
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the shoulders of the officer that is
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
subject to the hearing
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
to make a prevailing argument that uh
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
what they're about to talk about
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
should be kept
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
in a non-public setting
 
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
in a non-public setting
uh

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
because this is so new uh
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
generally speaking if there was any even
 
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
generally speaking if there was any even
remote

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
remote
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
issue that we thought was going to be
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
private the whole thing was held in
 
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.470 align:start position:0%
private the whole thing was held in
private

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i should say a non-public you
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
know setting
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
this decision is very very new and in
 
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.510 align:start position:0%
this decision is very very new and in
fact

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
the law that just recently went into
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
effect that
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
demands that these hearings be held in
 
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.109 align:start position:0%
demands that these hearings be held in
public

00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
public
notwithstanding

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
the privacy issues
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
i candidly i will tell you that the
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
council is learning and putting in place
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
new processes we're very fortunate to
 
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.829 align:start position:0%
new processes we're very fortunate to
have

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
attorney stacy mosher who's attached to
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
our agency from the attorney general's
 
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.670 align:start position:0%
our agency from the attorney general's
office

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
she serves as our
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
civil attorney and she's been
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
just excellent in terms of providing
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
guidance as we we kind of get our arms
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
around these new procedures that we have
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we are very sensitive
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
to the notion of due process to that
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
officer as well
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
it is imperative that
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
those officers receive complete due
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
process as part of this this overarching
 
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.349 align:start position:0%
process as part of this this overarching
uh

00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
new way of of us doing business
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative bucco
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
um this proposal for one full-time
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
attorney and two full-time investigators
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's is
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
is there that much misconduct i mean
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's quite a long list of violations
 
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
it's quite a long list of violations
here

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
i uh representative bucco i think this
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
is this is an excellent question because
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the answer is unknown we don't know
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh if this legislation goes into effect
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
and and the switch gets flipped
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be receiving these
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
complaints and
 
00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
complaints and
we

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
i have talked to
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
peers throughout the nation
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
and subject matter experts relative to
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
police investigations use of force
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
investigations as an attorney out of
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
connecticut that is really is a subject
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
matter expert and
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
and uh all of their opinion collectively
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
is that uh stand by because uh the
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
complaints are gonna come in uh
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know a whole lot
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
heavier than
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
what we've probably anticipated in the
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
first instance uh when the light shines
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes and and
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i think it'll be imperative that
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
if in fact this legislation goes through
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
it'll be imperative for the uh the
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
attorney and the investigators to stay
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
true to
 
00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.150 align:start position:0%
true to
uh

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
those areas of misconduct that are
 
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
those areas of misconduct that are
identified

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we don't get any
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
mission creep where we're we're going
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of of really what this
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to address thank
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
you want the attorney to work for you
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
and not for the ag as
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
ah that is correct madam uh
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
one of the uh stipulations to form uh
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
this type of review committee which came
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
out of leak
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that it was
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
a standalone executive branch agency
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
and while
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office also fits
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
in that same category
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
they have a very specific
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility to investigate
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
matters of public integrity where a
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
public servant would be committing a
 
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
public servant would be committing a
crime

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
under the color of their particular job
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
to include police officers
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it was uh really decided that the
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
the misconduct piece and the criminal
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
piece should be kept separate
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason that uh this this
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee would be
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
at police standards and training
 
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.470 align:start position:0%
at police standards and training
so

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
this particular lawyer would only be
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with misconduct
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
the way we see this now yes ma'am
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay and the two investigators would be
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
investigating misconduct only they would
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
be uh yes uh that is that would be their
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
primary function is to to investigate uh
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
allegations of misconduct and
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
and to be clear uh not only would they
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh be responsible for conducting
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
independent investigations but also
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
working with agencies that have robust
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
internal affairs agencies
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
example would be manchester pd or the
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
state police where
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
a good bulk of that work would be
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
carried by the agency
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
our investigators would work with them
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that things are done within
 
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.430 align:start position:0%
to make sure that things are done within
the

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
parameters set forth in this particular
 
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.109 align:start position:0%
parameters set forth in this particular
bill

00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
i hope you know that there are thousands
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
of state jobs out there
 
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
of state jobs out there
empty

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
empty
 
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.309 align:start position:0%
empty
so

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:01.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
what is uh
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
what is your thought process if this
 
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.470 align:start position:0%
what is your thought process if this
passes

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
in being able to hire
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
these three people
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
easier to hire
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
identify an attorney to take on this
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
particular position
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
i will tell you candidly that
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
people who are going to act in the role
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the investigator will need to be
 
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
of the investigator will need to be
seasoned

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
seasoned
 
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
seasoned
police

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
leaders people who have sat in
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
command positions uh to really have a
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
very firm grasp of what uh you know what
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're investigating and the landscape
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
in which these things uh occur
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
so to that end it may be more difficult
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
for us to find
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
invest full-time investigators
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
nonetheless i do know that
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of this and uh
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
i am interested to see if it does go
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know what what type of people will
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
be applying for for these types of
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
positions and i think there is a
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous pool of of people out there
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to to look in our
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
direction uh will be the
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
the difficult part as you know yeah
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
scalp them from somebody else that's uh
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's pure cannibalism out there
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
right not that right everybody's
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
stealing from everybody absolutely
 
00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:51.589 align:start position:0%
stealing from everybody absolutely
um

00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
i did not see an implementation date
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
oh there it is i'm sorry excuse me
 
00:45:58.319 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
oh there it is i'm sorry excuse me
so

00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
um is the the 350 000
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
since this isn't
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
isn't effective until
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
one january
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
is the 350 for a full year
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
or is it really
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
half of that um
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
it would be
for

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh the whole year and in fact
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
our thought process was to begin funding
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the area of november
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
and that would but you can't do that
 
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
and that would but you can't do that
because

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
it says the effective date is one
 
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.109 align:start position:0%
it says the effective date is one
january

00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
january
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
so you can't hire
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
people before
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
one general oh okay yes that doesn't
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
mean you can't go out and recruit so
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they could come to work on
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
january 2nd okay but we're basically we
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have six months from january till one
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
july or 30 june
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
that our appropriation
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
could be halved or something
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
understood madam yes
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh and to that end um
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
we were trying to be proactive to
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
kind of get the roster set i got it i
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
got it so when the the switch got
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
flipped we were ready to roll so okay
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
understood so
 
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:29.190 align:start position:0%
understood so
is

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
i believe i believe that would cover the
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
so how much do you want to give them
 
00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:16.950 align:start position:0%
so how much do you want to give them
mickey

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead tomorrow
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this is the
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
can the council absorb this cost now
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
without without having to
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the line there it says
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
that it could be absorb excess any cost
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
in excess of the 350 could be absorbed
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm asking the question if
 
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm asking the question if
the

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
program can be started before you get
 
00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
program can be started before you get
this

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.710 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think we could and and
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
it will
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
it will cause us to go back we're
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go in front of fiscal
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
on friday to to reappropriate
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
a number of our lines
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
if if it was
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
this body's opinion that we should try
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
to fund it that way we would we would do
 
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
to fund it that way we would we would do
it

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
well just to follow up i'm just bringing
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
it up because this is the second year of
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
the budget and
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
we usually don't make appropriations
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
in this year
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i i hear you but i also know that
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh police standards and training is kind
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
of on the edge yes uh so i
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
prefer to give them
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
some amount i'm just throwing yeah i
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
know tom not not the 350
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
but some thing yes
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i agree um
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
this is a whole new
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
being for you
 
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.790 align:start position:0%
being for you
um

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
i would expect it's gonna require
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
who could be pretty expensive
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am um
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is a tough tough thing
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and it needs to be done well
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we all would agreed to that um
 
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.150 align:start position:0%
i i think we all would agreed to that um
and

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i think if if
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you're those three the 350 000 is
 
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.109 align:start position:0%
and you're those three the 350 000 is
non-lapsing

00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
um i would i would also
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
concur with with the chair that i would
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
like to see something because i think
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
this is too important
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
um not to invest appropriately in it at
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
this time because this is a big deal
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so mickey the this says that uh
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be will they would have the money
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
somebody throw out a number
 
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
somebody throw out a number
200

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
some questions you can ask all the
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
guess a personal comment if i may um
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
you referenced that you know you're
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with issues around
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and some issues that may
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
involve children and mental health on
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
the council is there a place for a
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
professional a mental health
 
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.870 align:start position:0%
professional a mental health
professional

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
to perhaps identify or help form a
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
conversation around some of those issues
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
there is not a specific person
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
specified under statute that should have
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
a mental health background to be part of
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
the council
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
we do work very closely and have
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
identified with
 
00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:14.870 align:start position:0%
identified with
a

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
provider who is really kind of the
 
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.309 align:start position:0%
provider who is really kind of the
council's

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
council's
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
mental health provider and in fact we
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
have engaged that doctor
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
in a couple of cases already where the
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
council asked for
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
some um
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
some further information with regard to
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
an officer that you know may be in front
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the council
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
beforehand to to maybe offer some
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
additional psychological screening and
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe some uh support
 
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.549 align:start position:0%
or maybe some uh support
uh

00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know that it's um
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i i can speak for the the sitting
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
members of the council now they're very
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh vigilant and
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh sensitive to
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know where we are with with uh
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
that cops are people
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and people have problems and they
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
need help and and uh
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know to that end
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
they've been very good about making sure
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
that those things are in place
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
while balancing
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the tough part is while
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
balancing accountability and making sure
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
that you know the officer is safe to be
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
out there working with the public and
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to be a
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
and just if i made my personal comment i
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
was in a horrible car accident at the
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of january and the state
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
police were so fabulous and
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
compassionate and helpful and
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
professional and all the way through and
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
trooper gasek was my
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
was my buddy
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
ah sorry about that yes
 
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:10.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
chairman umberger said at the at the
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
beginning it's my understanding that
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
although this this bill
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
formalizes uh in a very good way i mean
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think i absolutely support the bill
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
this the uh
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
this new process as i understand it
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know in a more in a in a less formal
 
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.549 align:start position:0%
you know in a more in a in a less formal
sense

00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is kind of what you've been doing
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time is that is that correct
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
and and so i just to sort of follow up
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
on that i guess i i wonder if you could
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
give us
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
some indication for example you you
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
referenced that attorney moser from uh
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office is kind of
 
00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:00.549 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office is kind of
your

00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
is your kind of contact person
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
so could you give us some indication on
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know say over
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
over the last five years on average
 
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
over the last five years on average
how

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
how much time have uh has an attorney
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
been involved in
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know misconduct kind of
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
investigations on the one hand and then
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
can you give us some indication of of
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
how much investigator resources you've
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
used on a
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
on average in a given year over the last
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
five years excellent
 
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.549 align:start position:0%
five years excellent
so

00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
to be clear uh my my second year
 
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
to be clear uh my my second year
anniversary

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
anniversary
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term a prosecuting
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
attorney for hearings right
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the history of police standards and
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
training that has been left to
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
that role has been left to the bureau
 
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
that role has been left to the bureau
commander

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
commander
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%

training
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it has been um
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
colloquial for lack of a better term
 
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.870 align:start position:0%
colloquial for lack of a better term
right

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
we have relied
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
100 on the investigation that is
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
conducted by the outside agency without
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
review to speak up
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
or without providing
 
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.069 align:start position:0%
or without providing
additional

00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
guidance or
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
asking for more information we really
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
take that investigation done by an
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
outside agency at face value
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
our standards division will review that
 
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.870 align:start position:0%
our standards division will review that
case

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
we would bring that case forward and
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's prosecuted by
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
major dave parento who
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
retired number two from new hampshire
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
state police and now
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
runs the standard bureau
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
of training
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was identified
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
during the leak commission and then
 
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.710 align:start position:0%
during the leak commission and then
further

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
spoken about
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
on the actual misconduct

commission

00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
was that the process needed to be more
 
00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.829 align:start position:0%
was that the process needed to be more
adversariable

00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
adversariable
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
and that the prosecutor should in fact
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
prosecute the case
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
and be ready to provide a
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
sentenced recommendation beyond that and
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm really trying to kind
 
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm really trying to kind
of

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
what's what's the basis upon which
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
you believe that you would need a
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
full-time attorney
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
number one and number two what's the
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
basis upon which you believe you would
 
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
basis upon which you believe you would
need

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
two full-time investigators in other
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
words that it
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
i i guess in some sense i maybe share
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative puko
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
maybe expressed earlier is that is this
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
is there really that much misconduct
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna that you know you're
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
gonna you're gonna be able to occupy an
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
attorney full-time or occupy two
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
investigators full-time
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
or would it make more sense for us at
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
least initially
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate enough money let's say for a
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
part-time attorney and maybe
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
one investigator or even a part-time
 
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
one investigator or even a part-time
investigator

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.309 align:start position:0%
investigator
um

00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
with you know the understanding that if
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
it turns out
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're overwhelmed then you know you
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
come back next year and say we need you
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
know we need more
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
we need more we need more resources
 
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.030 align:start position:0%
we need more we need more resources
excellent

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
excellent question i think that
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
as much work as there is
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
going into investigating this conduct
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
many times more effort
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
to review cases that are not going to be
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
looked at by this committee we're going
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
to need to have this vetting process in
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.069 align:start position:0%
 
these

01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
i apologize are going to
 
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
i apologize are going to
um

01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
really be
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
i anticipate it's going to be a a real
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
floodgate when this when this happens
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
people are going to want to file
 
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.589 align:start position:0%
people are going to want to file
complaints

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
that are going to be outside of the very
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
narrow scope that's outlined in in 106l
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
as proposed
 
01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:49.990 align:start position:0%
as proposed
uh

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
i i cannot tell you judge how what the
 
01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:54.230 align:start position:0%
i i cannot tell you judge how what the
uh

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
the case load is going to be
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh the other portion of this is that
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh it is now incumbent upon police
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
to review these uh
 
01:01:10.079 --> 01:01:11.829 align:start position:0%
to review these uh
investigations

01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
and to possibly have to go back with our
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
investigators to gather more information
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases there's going to be
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
agencies that will not have the
 
01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
agencies that will not have the
bandwidth

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
bandwidth
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
to complete an investigation on their
 
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
to complete an investigation on their
own

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
an average-sized police department in
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has 10
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
full-time police officers and so a vast
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
number of them have less than that they
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
do not have robust ias
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh professional standards things of that
 
01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
uh professional standards things of that
nature

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
they have professional citizens they
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a unit that addresses those
 
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.990 align:start position:0%
don't have a unit that addresses those
things

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
things
so

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
i i wish i could give you an answer i
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
can't because i don't know what the call
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
volume is going to be i don't know what
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
the workload is going to be i anticipate
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of it
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
and i anticipate that a lot of it is
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to have to be looked at carefully
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
and a decision will probably be made if
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is not within our purview and we're
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to refer this back to the
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
home agency it doesn't fall within the
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
confines of misconduct as defined uh but
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
i i just don't know
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
sorry no no thank you
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other yes represent
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
turcotte thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
for the question um first could i just
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
get your name again i missed it oh sure
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of people like to put an e-r on
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
the end of that but very good
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
um the question i i guess i'm kind of
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
going down representative lin's line of
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
questioning sure and that is
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds like you're saying that
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
by staffing these additional positions
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're almost going to be inviting an
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
may i make a comment on that
 
01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:08.549 align:start position:0%
may i make a comment on that
uh

01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
sorry uh but
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
i have spoken to
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
my police chief not about this
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
particular thing but about the whole
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
issue of misconduct
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
and the problem is right now there is no
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
standard for misconduct in the state
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
and every single police chief
 
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:28.829 align:start position:0%
and every single police chief
treats

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
treats
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
misconduct differently
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
my police chief may some send something
 
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.789 align:start position:0%
my police chief may some send something
in

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
but police chief in
 
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.829 align:start position:0%
but police chief in
why

01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so that's why
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
that mr skipa is having so much trouble
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
trying to define
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
how big the pie is
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
if the feeling is that uh by hiring
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
these folks we're gonna invite
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
an increased call volume i i
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that is not what i meant to say or
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
that is not what i meant to say or
communicate

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.190 align:start position:0%
communicate
uh

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh
really

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think that uh you know this was
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
carefully thought out during the
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we really felt that
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
to get this program started this was
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
really kind of low balling what what may
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know come down the road
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know with that said uh
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i just you know i i just could not
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
tell you how big the wave is gonna be
 
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.390 align:start position:0%
tell you how big the wave is gonna be
and

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
talking to my uh
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
my peers across the country uh they are
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're telling me that you know you
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
stand by because
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to be getting a lot of
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
complaints and those complaints have to
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
be vetted by somebody uh and then once
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
we determine that the complaint is a
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate complaint we're gonna have to
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
steer those investigations
 
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
steer those investigations
um

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate uh
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know this different line of thought
 
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.750 align:start position:0%
you know this different line of thought
like

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe the floodgates don't
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
open at all and nobody shows up to the
 
01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:25.029 align:start position:0%
open at all and nobody shows up to the
party

01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that would be good um and then i'd
 
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
and that would be good um and then i'd
have

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
i've had
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
i would have employees that i could have
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
do other things as well right
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
another piece to the investigator's pie
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
will be to help us conduct
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
compliance audits which are things that
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
uh we have
uh

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
it was identified uh in a 2019 audit of
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
our operation where we were falling very
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
short on
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so those uh those investigators
 
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.750 align:start position:0%
and so those uh those investigators
certainly

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh could
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
pick up the ball and and
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
also help us conduct those those
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
compliance audits is what we call them
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that agencies are are
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what they're supposed to
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay now comes the hard part
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to try to get agreement on
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
some number
 
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
some number
and

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
i will start out
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like poker
 
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.470 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like poker
[Laughter]

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
i will start out with a
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
175 which is basically
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
six months worth of
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and two investigators
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
i can guarantee you these three people
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
will not be on board
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
on january 2nd
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
so there will be
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
money that's uh that's uh
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
left out of that
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
so is there
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's how
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair and
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee i'm the
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of house bill 1547
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm distributing for you today
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
modified testimony that i gave to the
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
environment and agricultural committee
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this division 2 work
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
session so i'm going to paraphrase it
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
just a bit
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to start really with my
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
concluding remarks since they may be the
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
most relevant to this committee and that
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
is i've been assured by new hampshire
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services of
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
which mr wimsat is here today to talk
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
after me that there are no fiscal
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
impacts on state revenues or
 
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.309 align:start position:0%
impacts on state revenues or
expenditures

01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
additionally there is potential decrease
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
in expenditures for local governments
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
now for my bill
 
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
now for my bill
1547

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
1547
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
was replaced entirely by an amendment
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be sure everybody has
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
the proper version is that it is the
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
amended version it was entirely scraped
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
the original version to be replaced with
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment does three things
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the first is that it allows the
 
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.270 align:start position:0%
uh the first is that it allows the
commissioner

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
commissioner
of

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.070 align:start position:0%
environmental services
to

01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
initiate rules for soil remediation
 
01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
initiate rules for soil remediation
standards

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
for perfluorochemicals
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
by november 1st 2023
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
let me go back just a bit this bill came
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
from a brainstorm session last summer
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
as you may know merrimack has faced
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary pollution issues because
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
of saint gobain performance plastics
 
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
of saint gobain performance plastics
these

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
plastics uh chemical called pfas of
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
which there are many and they're still
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
being identified
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
have made their way into drinking water
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
soil and air not only in merrimack but
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
also surrounding communities
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
so last summer a group of legislators uh
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
got together and decided you know what
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
are we going to do what issues do we
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
want to focus on this particular
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
so when it came to soil the idea was
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we needed a meter of what
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
constituted a pfas pollution in soil and
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
as we were discussing
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
we had certain ideas but then we brought
 
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
we had certain ideas but then we brought
in

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
in
des

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and they let us know
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
usgs excuse me usgs
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
which is the united states geological
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
survey is already performing a study of
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire soil that's due by the
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
fall of 2022
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
so our original thought in the
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
brainstorm session to set these
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
standards was way way too premature
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
based on the study that's being done by
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government and that has a
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
due date
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the first section of the bill
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes that that the usgs is going
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be performing that study and that
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
they have a due date by which to report
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
those study findings
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's section one of the bill
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
section two amends the groundwater
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
protection act rulemaking section to add
 
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
protection act rulemaking section to add
soil

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
soil
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
and to add that a person
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
which i'll get back to in a moment
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
liable for such contamination provides
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
safe alternative to water
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
to an impacted well
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if there is soil pollution found
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
based on the standards
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner said based on the
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
study that the usgs had
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
there can be a remedy there
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
we were assured the word person as
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
defined in the law
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
also includes companies
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
and public or private corporations
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
so that is section two
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
then we get to lengthy section three
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad i started with the fiscal
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
piece because if you were to read
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill it would
 
01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:13.590 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill it would
appear

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
appear
 
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
appear
pricey

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
pricey
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
but in actuality it's actually a
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
friendly amendment that comes from
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire des
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying language
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
that describes certification
 
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.709 align:start position:0%
that describes certification
requirements

01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
for certain hazardous
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
waste generators this is going to avoid
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
confusion with those requirements that
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
are done on the federal level
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
and also maintain consistency between
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
our law and new hampshire for hazardous
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
waste generators and federal law
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i conclude my remarks uh having told
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
you uh the bottom line price
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
having also gone through the amended
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
version which replaces the entire bill
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make note
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill in my community
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as almost um i hesitate to
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
use the word perfect but a perfect bill
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the community working
 
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of the community working
together

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%

the environment and agriculture
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
committee approved the bill unanimously
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill also went through the full
 
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
the bill also went through the full

without debate and with that i'll
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
conclude my remark thank you madam chair
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for your
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
attention and your service are there any
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
first representative mooney
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay oh
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes i guess i have to ask this um uh
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i guess i have to
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
ask this just to be sure that
 
01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.189 align:start position:0%
ask this just to be sure that
um

01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
where it where the when this is the
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
amended version by the way uh
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
two four two four four two four nine h
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
and we're um
 
01:15:14.239 --> 01:15:15.669 align:start position:0%
and we're um
exceedingly

01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
exceedingly
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i could
 
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.470 align:start position:0%
i guess i could
um

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fiscal note where it
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
says the exceedingly low standards that
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would establish
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
the costs would fall on property owners
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
village districts municipalities
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
counties and the state
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that all
 
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
is that all
um

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
um
been

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
well i don't know how it's been resolved
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
because this is amendment is the same
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
number that you're quoting here
 
01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.229 align:start position:0%
number that you're quoting here
so

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
so my my question is
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
um um are these
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
property owners village districts
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities comptons and state are
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
they gonna
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
are they gonna be liable for they would
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
huge costs
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
because these standards are so low okay
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
two things thank you for the question uh
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
first i believe the fiscal note's been
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
revised and second of all i know mr
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
wimsett's eager to address that note
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
that he himself worked on and that
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
should clarify thank you yes
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
up until up until i'm i'm sorry go ahead
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
there was huge costs because these
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
standards were so low so i guess
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
am i asking the question that you've
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
already answered
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
this this says the county and
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
state local
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
local and county governments may see in
 
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
local and county governments may see in
decrease

01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
so it went from these huge these
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
excessively low standards and huge costs
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
to now there's a decrease
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
that just brings up a question of how
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
did that happen
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pass that that's a great
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
nexus to
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr webb sat thank you representative
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
oh look at her sneaking out on that one
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great introduction
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
the committee good afternoon
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
if you'd like i'd be happy to answer
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative glucose question right
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
now absolutely sure so the original uh
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
version of the bill um although
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned proposed to set soil
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
standards numerical soil standards that
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
were exceedingly low they were actually
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
based upon the drinking water standards
 
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
based upon the drinking water standards
for

01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
for those same four pfas compounds
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
and what you know unless you're in this
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
business you don't know that
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
while drinking water standards tend to
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
be on the relatively low side in terms
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
of concentration because it's a it's a
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
direct exposure through drinking water
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know two and a half liters a day for
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
a lifetime
 
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
a lifetime
um

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
the corresponding soil standards that we
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
typically set for that
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
are usually at least three orders of
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
magnitude higher because they don't pose
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the same risk in soils as they do in
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
so like i said while well-intentioned
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
erroneously proposed to set those
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
standards to be equivalent to the
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
drinking water standards so it would
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
have set standards in soil that were
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
unachieved not only unachievable but
 
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
unachieved not only unachievable but
probably

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
you couldn't even test for them at those
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
levels in soil so that was what our
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note suggested that
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to actually pass this
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
in its original form
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
it would create an untenable regulatory
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
situation that would be famously
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
expensive to try to comply with so
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's why that but but the bill is in
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
its current amended proposed amended
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
form or as amended by the house
 
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.229 align:start position:0%
form or as amended by the house
would

01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions for mr
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
um the other question that i had if i
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
made him
 
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
made him
uh

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.669 align:start position:0%
uh
is

01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:46.390 align:start position:0%
is
i

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
i remember reading somewhere and this is
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
this goes back a while it may be a year
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
ago or even more that
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh in connection with what was going on
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
in in merrimack that
 
01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
in in merrimack that
um

01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
the standards being
 
01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
the standards being
proposed

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
um were uh way lower than the federal
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
standards and i and i guess what i want
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure of is
 
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
to make sure of is
the

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
i under you you've given the explanation
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
for soil versus water it's it's
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
different but will the soil standards i
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
mean do you anticipate that the soil
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
standards that will
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
eventua that will
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
govern here
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
are consistent with the federal soil
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:32.709 align:start position:0%
are consistent with the federal soil
standards

01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
could you turn your mic on just press
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
the button thank you better doesn't it
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
it works
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes so to be clear what you would have
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
read a year ago would have been
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
referring to our drinking water
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
standards and it is true
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the drinking water standards that
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
we set based on our own review of the
 
01:20:51.199 --> 01:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
we set based on our own review of the
science

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
were lower than what was in place at the
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
time under the fed the federal the
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
federal government has to be said does
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
not currently have
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
drinking water mcl's that are
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
enforceable under the safe drinking
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
water act they just have what they call
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
a health advisory
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
they've basically said that for the two
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
compounds that most people are familiar
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
with pfoa and pfos
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
that a combined standard of 70 parts per
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
trillion is their health advisory
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
we were directed by this body by the
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to actually review the
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
science and
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
all the available science to date and
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
develop proposed state level drinking
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
water standards and when we did that
 
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.510 align:start position:0%
water standards and when we did that
review

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
we arrived at numbers for pifoa and
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
pifos at 12 parts per trillion and 15
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion
 
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion
respectively

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.870 align:start position:0%
respectively
and

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that since that time the
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
federal government has been trying to
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
catch up with the science
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what they're going to do
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
but the expectation is that they are
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
very likely to lower their advisory
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
and potentially propose a drinking water
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
mcl that would be federally enforceable
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that will be much more consistent with
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we've already set in
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
state law
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where that comes from
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
as far as how that translates to soil
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
um again uh you know the we will we were
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
already about 12 months into our work
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
to begin setting soil standards for pfas
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
compounds and
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
we had to do and we have to do a lot
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
more work to set appropriate standards
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
for those compounds than we have had to
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
do for other contaminants
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
and the reason in part is because they
 
01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
and the reason in part is because they
are

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
considered to pose a risk at such low
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
concentrations in drinking water and
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
when we set our soil standards we set
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
them so that the idea is we try to in
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
the first instance we try to assess
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
leachability so if you have a certain
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
concentration of these compounds in soil
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
what concentration will result in
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
after it trickles down and leaches into
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
the groundwater into violation of a
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard so that someone
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
using that groundwater would be getting
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
an unacceptable
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
dose of that contaminant
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
so that's how we landed those in but but
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
for pfas because the compounds are so
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
unique in the way that they behave in
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
the soil
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and at the in in the fact that they're
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
relative uh regulated at low levels
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
we have to do a little bit more fancy
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
science if you will to really determine
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
what those numbers ought to be so the
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
first the the usgs study that
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
represented mooney referenced is really
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
a three-part study we're we've completed
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
the first part which is to try to get an
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
idea what are the background
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
concentrations of pfas in soils across
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
the whole state because we know that
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
these compounds have been
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know moving on the winds and
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
deposited on the ground from
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
precipitation for decades
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the absence of any particular local
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
source so we know that we see
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
a background level of phase in soil
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
around the state so first we had to get
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
our arms around what that was
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
and then we are now doing in the second
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
phase of the project where they are
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
taking some of the soil samples that
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
were collected
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and doing laboratory studies on them to
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
see how they behave
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking at different soil types
 
01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
we're looking at different soil types
because

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
while all contaminants move differently
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
with different soil types these
 
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
with different soil types these
contaminants

01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
are particularly behaved that way and so
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're looking at we for the first time
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
we may actually end up setting soil
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
standards that are different based on
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the soil type so if you had a
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
a loam in a valley valley loam you know
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
you might it might be one appropriate
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
standard and if you had a sandy gravel
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it might be a more
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate a different number that
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to do that work and
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
we're also going to because we
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have a number of sites in
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
where we know local sources of pfas have
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated soils
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing field studies at those sites
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
usgs is doing that work for us to see
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
how the the known pfas concentrations in
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
the soil
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
are behaving and how they contribute to
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality impacts so it's
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
pretty complex and then once we have all
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
that we're still going to need to hire a
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
contractor to do some modeling to help
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
us develop those numbers so it's a
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
pretty complex business
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
but we felt that it really was the only
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate science-based way to set
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
soil standards that were fair
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
to the regulated community and that
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
that would be reflective of what how
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
these compounds really behave
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
so that's a long answer but i wanted to
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
give you some background about
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
how what we're working on
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you madam
 
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.270 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you madam
chair

01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.189 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
many of the areas we're talking about
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
are areas are agricultural
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
are studies being conducted in relation
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
to what does it mean for the farms that
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
we have in these areas that's a terrific
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
question and there are both uh studies
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
in this nation and internationally that
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
have been conducted
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
a lot more work needs to be done
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
and we're actually considering some work
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
locally here in new hampshire to try to
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
evaluate that question in the coming
 
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
evaluate that question in the coming
year

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's something that we've we've tried to
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
be as helpful to
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've had questions as you can imagine
 
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.270 align:start position:0%
we've had questions as you can imagine
from

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know local farmers who are
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
raising and selling crops to backyard
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
gardeners who want to know if they're in
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
the area where soils have impacted is it
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
safe for them to
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
grow vegetables and eat them and water
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
the vegetables with their well water and
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing it's been a little
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
unsatisfying for them because we don't
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
have really solid answers for them but
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to monitor the science
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's being conducted internationally
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
and also do some of our own work to try
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
to advance those questions and get
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the usgs study in terms
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the extent that it's does the extent
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
of it participating in new hampshire and
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
how you they would disseminate
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
information to local municipalities you
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
know should they find a uptick somewhere
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
would they contact that municipality to
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
let them know or the municipalities
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
already in the loop and waiting for
 
01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.950 align:start position:0%
already in the loop and waiting for
information

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
sure great question so actually that
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
first step um of saying we get we took
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
about a hundred samples at various areas
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
across the state and we divided up the
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
state to try to get
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
a good geographic representation but we
 
01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.390 align:start position:0%
a good geographic representation but we
also

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
tried to look at various soil types for
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons that i described before so
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
that data
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
has just been shared with us i think
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
we're about to put that out on the
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
street so that people can look at it
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
understand that those
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
areas were selected purposely to try we
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
were trying not to
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
select anywhere where we knew we had a
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
local source of pfas contamination
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
because we were really trying to make
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
that a background study
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
now it has to be said there are parts of
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire where so much of
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
the land has been subjected to air
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
emissions that there you know it's there
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
is a local source and so that those data
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
might reflect that um but certainly
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be we'll be communicating this
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
with communities and if we see anything
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
that concerns us we'd be reaching out
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
directly to those communities
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
what i think is more
 
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.229 align:start position:0%
what i think is more
probably

01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
more more to the point of your question
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that when we identify a local source
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's created either a groundwater or
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
soil problem we're always communicating
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
whenever we identify a site
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's standard operating procedure to cc
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
the local health officer on any
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence that we make so that so
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative petry
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question now on these areas
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
where you have high concentrations
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
the remediation
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
probably is very costly if you can i
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
mean is that possible well i'm glad
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're asking the question and one of
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons that you know we're we're
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
really supportive of this bills one of
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
the things that it does is it directs us
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
by that same november 2023 date
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
promulgate regulations that are specific
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
to pfas
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to groundwater protection
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water protection and hazardous
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
waste sites so those are the three
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
statutes that it gives us direction for
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
and the reason we wanted that is that
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
because these contaminants are
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
so unique but also because they're so
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
prevalent in our in our in our state
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
we felt we needed to be able to make
 
01:29:17.679 --> 01:29:18.950 align:start position:0%
we felt we needed to be able to make
specific

01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
regulations that would recognize that
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
feasible so for instance we have you
 
01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
feasible so for instance we have you
know

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
several miles of i-93 that is being
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know worked on in southern new
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they're no doubt going to
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
encounter soils that have been because
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're in this area of air deposition
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
they're undoubtedly going to encounter
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
soils that are contaminated
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
and what we want to be able to do is to
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
promulgate regulations that you know if
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
you have reg soils that pose that that
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't meet a particular soil standard
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
that we might set
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
we want to have options other options
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
available to the owners of those sites
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
to cost effectively manage those soils
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know normally if we
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a soil standard and it's a
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste site we'll say well you
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
might spend you know two million dollars
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
just to take that soil to a disposal
 
01:30:10.159 --> 01:30:11.350 align:start position:0%
just to take that soil to a disposal
facility

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
and in some cases well you know that
 
01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.390 align:start position:0%
and in some cases well you know that
and

01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
be aware that there are times when
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
even under the current regulatory
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
scenario we find
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
more cost-effective ways to deal with
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
the soil but with pfas we thought it was
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to be really important to do that
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
particularly to protect
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
not only the private sector but
 
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
not only the private sector but
municipalities

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
local governments that may have a fire
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
station that that has impacted you know
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
with pfas trying to give them
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
sort of i guess uh what i would describe
 
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.030 align:start position:0%
sort of i guess uh what i would describe
as

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
tailored ways to deal with soil
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
contamination that aren't
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
going to just be so ridiculously
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
expensive that it's not really as
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable so that's why i think that
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
getting this authority
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
clear authority to make that kind of
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
rule do that kind of rulemaking is going
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be really important to protect thank
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of money out of cares
 
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.229 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of money out of cares
and

01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
and
arpa

01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
arpa
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
that have gone to pfas
 
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.070 align:start position:0%
that have gone to pfas
stuff

01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
can you just give us sort of a
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
overview of
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
how the department is planning to
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
spend that money sure so absolutely you
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
know it's obvious as best i can so um
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right the arpa money
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
in particular there's been uh you know
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
about right now about 150 million
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
dollars has been dedicated appropriated
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
to des
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
um to deal with both drinking water and
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
wastewater impacts that's primarily what
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
that money is is targeted for
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
and so we are um we have been working
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
mightily to
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know and that a lot of that money
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
is being
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
administered in combination with the
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
state drinking water and clean water sr
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
state revolving funds
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
so um there are a number of
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um water systems across the state over
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
100 that will benefit from that money
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
not all of them have pfas contamination
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
but some of them do
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
and there i i'm afraid i can't give you
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
the i can't i don't i can't i don't have
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
to top my head to provide the numbers
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
that are specific to pfas but
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
there will be a substantial amount of
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
money so a community water system or a
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
public water system that has to put on
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
carbon treatment for example to treat
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
pfas in the drinking water they're
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for grant money as well as loan
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
money to to address that
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a number of you know programs
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
right now where we're trying to provide
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
as much
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
financial assistance to those
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
communities to deal with these problems
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
as we possibly can and that i'm happy to
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
say that in addition to the arpa money
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is essentially one-time money
 
01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
which is essentially one-time money
the

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
the congress has passed
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
will also provide for the next five
 
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
will also provide for the next five
years

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
substantial increased funding to the
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
state revolving fund programs
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
and some specific targeted money to what
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're calling emerging contaminants
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
and pfas is certainly in that category
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
so that amounts to probably i think that
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
is going to amount to something on the
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
order of
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
six to eight million dollars per year
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
over five years that will be dedicated
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
to water and wastewater projects that
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
that need help to address pfas
 
01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.430 align:start position:0%
that need help to address pfas
contamination

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
so the good news is that there is you
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
know it's a big problem but there's a
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
fair amount of money that's being put to
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
it to try to assist these communities
 
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.629 align:start position:0%
it to try to assist these communities
so

01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
the assistance will come through
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
the water and sewer projects that are
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
approved for dollars much of it yeah and
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
what what is a little different is that
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
we do have some communities in southern
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
or areas of communities that do not have
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
public water systems right they're all
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
drinking water private drinking water
 
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
drinking water private drinking water
wells

01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
wells
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
the good news is through a lot of
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying by the states and a lot of
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
people concerned and sharing their
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
concerns with congress
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
much of that money will be eligible
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
those parties who normally wouldn't be
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for the srf they will be
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
eligible if they are going to
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're looking to
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
connect to another drinking water system
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
or even stand up their own new drinking
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
water system to address those private
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
wells that have been impacted so we have
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of work ahead of us
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the coming years but there's gonna
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you were able to take a
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
future snapshot say five years from now
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're gonna see a lot more homes on
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
public connected to public water systems
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
in southern new hampshire than than you
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
see right now
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
so i happen to be from northern new
 
01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
so i happen to be from northern new
hampshire

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
overall i'm
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
not aware of a lot of pfas problems
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
up north
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
is that sort of a true statement
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's a that is a fair
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
statement when we you know if we if you
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
look at our map of impacts from pfas it
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
is definitely weighted much more heavily
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
to the southern half of the state and
 
01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
to the southern half of the state and
that's

01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
not surprising because it's going to
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
tend to track with
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities and the
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
intensity of commercial and
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industrial development
 
01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.669 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industrial development
so

01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
as a general rule the north country has
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
much less of that kind of contamination
 
01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.709 align:start position:0%
much less of that kind of contamination
than

01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's not immune to the global impacts
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
that you know for that background i mean
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
no matter where we look in the state
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a certain background
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
concentrate a low co background
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
concentration of pfas just from
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
global transport but in terms of local
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
sources it's much less prevalent in the
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
north country than it is in southern and
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
seacoast new hampshire
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions yes
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead just one final question um do
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
you plot
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
cancer clusters
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
in relation to high impact pfas areas
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
well the department of environmental
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
services doesn't doesn't collect or
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
process cancer data that's the purview
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the department of health and human
 
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
of the department of health and human
services

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
working on and they have an existing
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%

which
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
proposes to set up
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
a municipal road and bridge disaster
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
relief fund
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
in order to provide
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
gap funding to municipalities
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
that have experienced damage to the
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges due to a natural
 
01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:37.510 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges due to a natural
disaster

01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
my town was hit with
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
horrible flooding
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
weather that we had
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
and there was significant road damage
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
and bridge damage done in our town
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i had come
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
to speak with many of the
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
house and senate leadership seeking
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
funds to help our municipality
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
work through
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
getting this damage repaired as quickly
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
as possible because there were major
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
roads through our town
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
houses and businesses
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
were cut off from being able to have
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
access in and out of town there was
 
01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.070 align:start position:0%
access in and out of town there was
actually

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
only one or two ways in and out of town
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
and what i was
 
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
and what i was
told

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
told
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
by many people though there was quite a
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
bit of sympathy and desire to want to
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
help us in acworth
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
there was no statutory mechanism to get
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
money to us
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
in any expedient manner
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:56.639 --> 01:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
and so
that's

01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
where the idea for this
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
municipal road and bridge disaster
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
relief fund came from
 
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.430 align:start position:0%
relief fund came from
so

01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill to
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
the municipal
 
01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.350 align:start position:0%
the municipal
committee

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
and they passed it unanimously it is a
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation i worked with
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.310 align:start position:0%
on it
and

01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
we felt it was important to
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
establish this kind of fund
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
to help these towns
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
who experience this sort of devastation
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
and it was indeed devastating
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
being

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know at the height of their seasons
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
not being able to have access to their
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.189 align:start position:0%
not being able to have access to their
crops

01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
crops
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
bascom maple farms which is one of the
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
largest maple producers
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the state unable to get to their sap
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
lines to fix them
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
and get them ready for this time of the
 
01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.990 align:start position:0%
and get them ready for this time of the
year

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
farms that couldn't
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
get rid of their manure pits empty their
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
manure pits and uh that was starting to
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
cause a problem with um with them being
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
there was just a number of problems
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
utility poles that we couldn't have
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
access to because roads were so damaged
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
we couldn't get
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of equipment or materials
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
to do any kind of work on those
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
utility poles
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
imperative to have some sort of funding
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
immediately to get
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
work done on these roads to make them
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.830 align:start position:0%
work done on these roads to make them
passable

01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
passable
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
and seeing as we did not
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
we were unable to get any kind of help
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
from the state we had to turn to go to
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
um mascoma bank
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
and embarked on a 2.1 million dollar
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
loan for the town which we're still
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we're ever
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to pay back
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
this has been a financial
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
hardship for the town of akworth
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
it was also a financial it's also been a
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
financial hardship for some of the towns
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
surrounding our town
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
i know because of the
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
damage that was done to route 12
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of this
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
flooding and storms that we had
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
roads were diverted onto other roads
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
that really couldn't take that kind of
 
01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
that really couldn't take that kind of
traffic

01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
in langdon
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
i know that there was
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
i guess a south hemlock street
 
01:43:50.239 --> 01:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
i guess a south hemlock street
where

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
normally you get 50 cars a day
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
they ended up getting over a thousand a
 
01:43:56.239 --> 01:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
they ended up getting over a thousand a
day

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
which resulted in them having to
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
pay almost 28 000 a month in maintenance
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
to keep it was a gravel road to keep it
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
maintained so that school buses and
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
trucks could traverse there
 
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
trucks could traverse there
safely

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
the great financial impact that this
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
kind of uh natural disaster can
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
bring upon these small
 
01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
bring upon these small
communities

01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
who do not have
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
financial resources
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
we had in our in our bank account
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
in our fund balance in acworth only 550
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
000 available
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
and um we only had
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
we were only able to access 350 000 of
 
01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
we were only able to access 350 000 of
that

01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
to go towards road repairs
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
because we had to leave a 200 000 in the
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
and while we were able to use that money
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly wasn't
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know ample
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
funds to make the kinds of repairs that
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
we needed to make
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
but we used what we had available and
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
then we went had a special town meeting
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
and went to get this 2.1 million dollar
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
loan which we are working with mascoma
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
bank and
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
and so
that's

01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.830 align:start position:0%
that's
the

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much in a nutshell
 
01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.709 align:start position:0%
pretty much in a nutshell
why

01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
i've come to you today and hope that you
 
01:45:29.199 --> 01:45:30.629 align:start position:0%
i've come to you today and hope that you
will

01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay represent petrie
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question was this con
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
was this declared a national disaster
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
this was declared
 
01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
this was declared
a

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
emergency

01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
there was an emergency declaration
 
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.590 align:start position:0%
there was an emergency declaration
declared

01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
declared
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that happened um well i think it was
 
01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.070 align:start position:0%
and that happened um well i think it was
uh

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
three or four months after the event
 
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.189 align:start position:0%
three or four months after the event
happened

01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:46:09.199 --> 01:46:10.229 align:start position:0%
happened
and

01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i know there's a statute that is in
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
place now uh that says
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that a town can loan money from the
 
01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.390 align:start position:0%
that a town can loan money from the
state

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to wait until that
 
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.870 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to wait until that
disaster

01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
that declaration was declared by the
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
president of the united states
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
and i know that statute i guess is in
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's some bill in the senate
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
that seeks to change that
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
as it is i mean
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
we'd have to wait for presidential
 
01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.390 align:start position:0%
we'd have to wait for presidential
declaration

01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
declaration
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yep
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
that allows you to borrow from the
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't it no no
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
allows you to borrow money from the
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
state treasury the state treasury yeah
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
but it's at a better rate than what you
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
could get at a bank is that correct
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure i think i know the rate
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we got from the scoma bank was 2.6
 
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.629 align:start position:0%
that we got from the scoma bank was 2.6
percent

01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
percent
and

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know they were really really kind
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
and willing to work with us uh they're
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
even willing to work with us on a
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
schedule for paying the loan back and
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
the way it's structured is um it's sort
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
of like a revolving credit almost like a
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
home equity loan that as we
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
do a project we can expend funds from
 
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.709 align:start position:0%
do a project we can expend funds from
that

01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
and then when we apply to fema for
 
01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.590 align:start position:0%
and then when we apply to fema for
compensation

01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
whatever money fema decides to send to
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
us back we can take that money and put
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
it towards
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know put it back into
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
paying back the loan so it's sort of
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
like a revolving kind of credit
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
and this is maybe following up what you
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
just said so i understand you describe
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
this as gap funding
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for you know fema money to come
 
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.310 align:start position:0%
waiting for you know fema money to come
in

01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the statement of
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities wishing to draw from the
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
fund in the future shall pay into the
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
fund a certain amount does this mean
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
that when the fema money comes in do you
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse the money this this you know
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
does the money go back into this fund if
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
we were to set up the fund no that's
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
that was not the intention okay so
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
so you would get money from the state
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
for the infrastructure in addition to
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
whatever fema provides well as i
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
understand fema will not pay you if you
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
have gotten funds from other sources
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
but you would lose your fema money if we
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
possibly i'm not sure but
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
what i
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the intention was this
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
of this was to do
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of temporary repairs that
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
you may need to do in order to get
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
yourself back into
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
working order
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay may i follow up on that somewhere
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh you certainly yeah thank you so now
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
you use the word temporary so this would
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
be getting roads at least passable yes
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
but then you would still need funds in
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
order to make the roads permanently
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
passable yes and where would that money
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.310 align:start position:0%
come from
well

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
you would then
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
have your projects
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh which you would submit to fema as to
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
what road work you need to have done
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
that would be a project that you would
 
01:49:38.639 --> 01:49:40.390 align:start position:0%
that would be a project that you would
separately

01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
apply for fema helped with
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
so you really want to know that this
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
would not disallow you from fema money
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
right you suggested before that you
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
might lose fema money if you got money
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
from the state well fema reimbursement
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
is never guaranteed anyway
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't know
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
what they would approve or what they
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approve
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes i wonder um
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
have you um
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
had any discussions with fema about this
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and how it would
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know how it would work with with
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
getting fema
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
funding for if in the event that there
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
were disasters in the future i have not
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
and and i'm going to ask
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
have you had any discussions with the
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
about this proposal in other words do
 
01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.430 align:start position:0%
about this proposal in other words do
they

01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.550 align:start position:0%
they
um

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you propose to have towns that want
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
to to be able to contribute have you had
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
any you know
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
inquiry of other towns how many would
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
likely be willing to do this whether
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
they think it's a good idea whether the
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
municipal association thinks it's a good
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
idea or not i have not heard anything
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
from an hma about this
 
01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:02.709 align:start position:0%
from an hma about this
but

01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't see why
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
town wouldn't avail themselves
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
of a program like that if they needed it
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we have
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's a mutual aid to municipal mutual
 
01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.270 align:start position:0%
there's a mutual aid to municipal mutual
aid

01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
where towns pay into that so that if
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
they need help
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
in any kind of
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
problem that they have
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
say they need sand or they need
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of materials
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
the there is a
 
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
the there is a
municipal

01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
mutual aid
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
which works on the same kind of basis
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
you pay
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
a membership or some sort of annual fee
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
and you can then get help from this
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
mutual aid
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of kind of along the same
 
01:51:55.599 --> 01:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of kind of along the same
lines

01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.870 align:start position:0%
lines
right

01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
just i mean i i guess one of the things
 
01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.589 align:start position:0%
just i mean i i guess one of the things
that

01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:05.599 --> 01:52:06.790 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
might be a reason that other towns would
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
not you know would
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
would not be interested would be if
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
if the result would be
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
a potential loss of fema funding so
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
i mean that's
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
i i i guess it sounds like they're
 
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know respectfully it sounds like
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
there really might be more work to be
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
done before we know whether this is
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
really a good idea
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
or not that's
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
i can't help but saying that at least it
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
seems that way to me sure um well i you
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
know in my estimation i just wanted to
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
at least provide some sort of statutory
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle where monies can get to the
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
towns that need them in this kind of
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
situation because there is none
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
nothing exists for them now
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
and when a town is hit this badly
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
and there's absolutely no way that the
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
state can step in to help them
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
i find it um you know kind of
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
disappointing that we can't do something
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
to help our towns when they're in this
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
sort of situation
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
jeopardize some sort of funding from the
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
federal government at least it's
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
something to get them
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
going that they can get themselves put
 
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.589 align:start position:0%
going that they can get themselves put
together

01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know we had absolutely no resources
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
to do this we had people
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
contractors in the area
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
that lent their trucks and their
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
materials and said you know what we know
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
that you're in a really bad financial
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
situation now but we also know that you
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
need to get people on the road safely
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
and so we will help you and then at some
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
point in the future when you can pay us
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
back we'll be here
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
and thank god we had the goodness of
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
people's hearts to help us out
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
because we had nothing else
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was no statutory mechanism in the
 
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.709 align:start position:0%
there was no statutory mechanism in the
state

01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
to help a town in our position
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm seeking to do with
 
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.070 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm seeking to do with
this

01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you may i ask a series of
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions without asking for you
 
01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.390 align:start position:0%
questions without asking for you
certainly

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative aaron how are you i'm
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you good excellent um
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
just a few questions i want to get my
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
kind of head around some numbers here
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
what's approximately one half percent of
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
your mean your municipal budget enact 6
 
01:54:38.239 --> 01:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
your mean your municipal budget enact 6
500

01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
500
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
because our municipal budget operating
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
budget is about a million three
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
this year anyway
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and what what did you say in
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
your town what was the total estimated
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
damage or what was the actual damage
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay well you know we've we've seen uh
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
damage estimates as high as 26 million
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollars for our town of akworth which
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
has a town of 850 people
 
01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:06.310 align:start position:0%
has a town of 850 people
and

01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the 26 million dollar
 
01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:09.589 align:start position:0%
the 26 million dollar
estimate

01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
as i understand it was if every road was
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
made to
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
the way perfection the way it's supposed
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
to be according to
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
culvert size and
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
and all of the rules and regulations
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
realistically

01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
what we ended up spending i guess so far
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh we have plans for around around 10 or
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
11 million dollars
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
in work
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
i know that we've spent about um
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably a million three or million and
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
a half
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
thus far
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh of our own money
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
and also monies that you know from this
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
loan that we took out so
 
01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.589 align:start position:0%
loan that we took out so
um

01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
we we put money into the roads
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh to fix them temporarily and now we
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
are you know making plans to do the
 
01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.629 align:start position:0%
are you know making plans to do the
permanent

01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
work on them
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
and you know we have a town engineer uh
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
we hired an engineer to work on all
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
plans with and get all the permits and
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
everything from des and work with
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
homeland security and also fema to get
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the roads back to where they should be
 
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.790 align:start position:0%
the roads back to where they should be
um

01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
to this point has any money been
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the town on behalf of any
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
governmental agency fema
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
no and we don't expect to see any kind
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
of fema reimbursement until probably
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
late late spring
 
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.709 align:start position:0%
late late spring
it

01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
at you know
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
being optimistic
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay and my i guess the final question
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
if this had been
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
in effect at the time
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
how much of your damage
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
would have been covered
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yes well um i don't
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
know a dollar amount specifically it
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
would have to i would have had i would
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
ask have to ask that engineer who's
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
working with the town
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
um with regard to
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know what work
 
01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.629 align:start position:0%
you know what work
uh

01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
they put in place i i would say at least
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
the million three that we had to with a
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
million four or five whatever it was
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
that we had to cover that we've already
 
01:57:36.159 --> 01:57:37.270 align:start position:0%
that we had to cover that we've already
spent

01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
would have been covered
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it may have
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
made have prevented us from having to
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
mickey would you see if um
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
the fema guy could come and talk to us
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.639 --> 01:58:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.229 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%

homeland security and emergency
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
management so state fema
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're the good guys they're the bad guys
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
no just teasing
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
we're all good guys um so with me is
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
fallon reed who uh
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
is our special projects lead but
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
previous to that fallon was in charge of
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
all of our presidentially declared
 
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.870 align:start position:0%
all of our presidentially declared
disasters

01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
currently we're we have seven open fema
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
disasters uh that we're managing
 
01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
disasters uh that we're managing
and

01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
newly promoted as vanessa uranga who's
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
with us who took fallon space so they
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
are both the experts in the federal
 
01:59:21.119 --> 01:59:22.629 align:start position:0%
are both the experts in the federal
guidance

01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'll defer to them
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
momentarily so
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
um representative aaron was correct that
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
the flooding from july 29 30 did take a
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
to get declared although i have to say
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
it was record time for us that was
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
declared on october 4th
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
which is pretty unprecedented for fema
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
to turn around a disaster declaration in
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
that amount of time
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
that did get amended and the declaration
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
is now for the period of july 29 through
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
august 2nd and that was amended on
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
december 27th
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
of last year so we are
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
working with those towns in sullivan and
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
cheshire counties uh
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
pretty actively i have five staff that
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to just that one disaster
 
02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to just that one disaster
mission

02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
mission
 
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
mission
and

02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is as representative aaron said
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
currently a
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief loan um i
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
yep so that is um looking to get amended
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
this session and that will allow
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
for zero percent interest loans and um
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
the governor to declare a state
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
emergency ahead of a presidential
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
disaster declaration
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
the word of caution would be there's no
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
guarantee to a presidential disaster
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
declaration so if a
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
community were to ask the state treasury
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a no interest loan
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
ahead of a debt presidentially declared
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
disaster and we do not get it that the
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
community would be 100
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
on board for paying that back at zero
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
percent interest if it gets approved um
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
in this session um
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think there was something else we were
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to talk about so i'm going to turn
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
it to balance
 
02:01:23.679 --> 02:01:24.550 align:start position:0%
it to balance
um

02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so with the
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
what is 409 now when came through back
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
required a presidential disaster
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
declaration and then the interest rate
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
was whatever the prevailing rate was
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
through treasury and as the director
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned those are the two things we're
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
looking to change uh 402 is also out
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
there which is to split the cost share
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
because fema disaster declarations are
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
75 25
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
split and the applicant or the local
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
community is responsible for that 25 as
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
it stands right now um so they're
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
looking to change that to
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be 50 percent of the state and 50 on
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay and so that is in currently an sb
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
402 correct
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then 409 is the one to modify the
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief loan that
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator guida passed through in 2017.
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay but that's so that's law right now
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
409 is yes yep so yes so um
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
any of the applicants once we received
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
the disaster declaration on october 4th
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
could have asked for an exceptional
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
disaster relief loan
 
02:02:44.239 --> 02:02:45.030 align:start position:0%
disaster relief loan
for

02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
what they needed to make the repairs at
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the prevailing rate was
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
at the treasury at the time for a loan
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
and then whatever got reimbursed from
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
fema would the community would pay back
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
the treasury
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and go from there
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
so on the disaster relief side fema has
 
02:03:03.119 --> 02:03:04.310 align:start position:0%
so on the disaster relief side fema has
not

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
gone to the hundred percent yet like
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have on everything else this year
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
for covid we did um unfortunately for a
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
natural disaster to reach the threshold
 
02:03:13.679 --> 02:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
natural disaster to reach the threshold
for

02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get 90 or 100 percent in new
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
over 200 million dollars it has to be
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is some talk in dc that they may
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
be moving to do a 90 10 split for
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
disasters declared in the last year but
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't got confirmation of that so
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
right now we're operating off of the 75
 
02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:38.470 align:start position:0%
right now we're operating off of the 75
25

02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
until otherwise
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
but as far as this disaster goes and
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
then the one that was declared from
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
right before that as well because we got
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
hit twice in july
 
02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.510 align:start position:0%
hit twice in july
um

02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
we did have the opportunity for folks
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
who wanted to do the exceptional
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
disaster lethal and they could have
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
moved forward with that if they chose to
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
but we haven't
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
done anything with that loan since it
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.159 --> 02:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
um does your um agency take a stand on
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
hb 1665
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
um we do have some concerns with the
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
language things that you had brought up
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
before about how it would impact a
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
potential fema funding
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
especially if there are rules in
 
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
especially if there are rules in
the

02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.550 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
sorry the federal laws about if you have
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
essentially an insurance policy which
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of would be that that amount
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
has to be deducted from what fema will
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
pay you so
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
um any emergency work or long-term
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
repairs would deduct this amount from
 
02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:53.589 align:start position:0%
repairs would deduct this amount from
that

02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead so in light of senate
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill 409
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
is hb 1665 necessary
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think they come from two different
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
perspectives so
 
02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:08.950 align:start position:0%
perspectives so
um

02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:11.109 align:start position:0%
um
409

02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
409
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
does as the director mentioned we would
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
need a disaster declaration
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
eventually or the state would be out
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
that money
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading 1665 is that
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't necessarily have to you
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
know just they'd have an event and need
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
the money from that
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
but it really would come into play
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
with how
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
if we have a fema disaster declaration
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
and the reimbursement there so
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate what the bill's trying
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
to do but i think there might be
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
some risk to
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead please
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
so if you have more than one question
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
just just go ahead thank you i got tired
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
of flipping on the mic
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative if i may clarify one
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
thing um so 409 is a loan
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
where um
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
it would be you know like if you took
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
out a loan from me and reimbursed and
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
fema doesn't have a problem with that we
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
actually ran the language by them with
 
02:06:08.589 --> 02:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
that bill back in 2017. the concern was
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
1665. and i think you all brought it up
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
with that you keep that money yes and
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
that's where fema would say no that's
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
you can't have it both ways you know
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's either
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
something to get you through or they've
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
already fema doesn't need to reimburse
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
that because
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
um it's already been taken care of in
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
their eyes
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
a duplication of benefit all right just
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
yes please go ahead it is for you
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
can someone just clarify
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know you i got the impression and
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
you can correct me because it's probably
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying i can't keep track of the
 
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:48.790 align:start position:0%
i'm trying i can't keep track of the
time

02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
um was there a mechanism this 409 or
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
whatever was that in place that actworth
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
could have
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of that had they known
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
or had they chosen so that was available
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
to them which
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
not until we received the disaster
 
02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
not until we received the disaster
declaration

02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
declaration
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay but this thing was in existence
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
that they could have taken the loan from
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state or once we received the
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
disaster declaration yes okay
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
which is one of the modifications we're
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
making in 409 is that the governor can
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
if he declares a state of emergency then
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
that opens up this path we don't have to
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
wait for fema because it is usually
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
60 days or several years yeah so there
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent bucco
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
hey thank you madam chairman may i ask a
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
question of the lba you can ask anybody
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
you want in this room um
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know as i read through this
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i thought it sounded
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
like a really smart idea and i can
 
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
understand the need for it
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
but the the um
 
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
but the the um
the

02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note as amended
 
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note as amended
on

02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
march yeah march 11.
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
the last the whole last paragraph is
 
02:08:14.639 --> 02:08:16.149 align:start position:0%
the last the whole last paragraph is
about

02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
how fema
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
none of the work would be eligible for
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
female reimbursement
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
with a pile what they would consider a
 
02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
with a pile what they would consider a
policy

02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
am i reading that correctly uh yeah and
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
made the whole difference i was thinking
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
when i was reading through this that
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
that when the female money finally came
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
they would be reimbursed
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
but this whole paragraph says no that's
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add that
 
02:09:20.069 --> 02:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know there if if we had money in
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
place right away
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
from uh legislation such as this
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
there may be that that that particular
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
road project would not be something that
 
02:09:31.679 --> 02:09:32.550 align:start position:0%
road project would not be something that
we

02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
would have to apply to fema for help for
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
we could take care of this on our own
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
and not have to wait for the federal
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
government to give us any kind of
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
funding or help
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the intention behind
 
02:09:45.679 --> 02:09:46.709 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the intention behind
this

02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:46.719 --> 02:09:47.510 align:start position:0%
this
is

02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes there would be work that we would
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
need to have done that eventually
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know we could
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
apply to fema for help for
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
but for some of the road work that we
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
could do we could get it done quick
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
right away and you're done one and done
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't have to work you
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to wait for federal
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
government to step in and do anything so
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
kind of gives us an option of divorcing
 
02:10:11.599 --> 02:10:12.830 align:start position:0%
kind of gives us an option of divorcing
ourselves

02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
from waiting for a federal declaration
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
and you know any other kind of
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
declaration and uh you know
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
doing going through the whole
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy of of working with the
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
federal government so
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
if if we were able to get funds right
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
away from the state
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
to get us
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
to get back into working order
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
some of those projects wouldn't be
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to fema
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
there would be other road projects
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would and because we didn't
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
receive any money and use any money to
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
work on those projects that wouldn't be
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
a problem and it wouldn't interfere with
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
any kind of fema reimbursement so that
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
was just the only comment i wanted to
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
make on that thank you
 
02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
make on that thank you
representative

02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative erin again um
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
you said something that you may have
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
already answered this
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
how many towns other than acquired
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
would be willing to
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
get into this type of arrangement
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise in other words
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
putting in one half percent of the
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
municipal budget has that been
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i know you know new
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association is not
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
objecting to this and i think that
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's again it's an
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
basically enabling legislation if a town
 
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
chooses to participate in this kind of
 
02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.149 align:start position:0%
chooses to participate in this kind of
program

02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
they can and especially i think it would
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to our smaller towns our
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
smaller rural towns
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
who do not have the financial
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to deal with a devastating
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
natural disaster such as this
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
and you know short of them getting any
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
kind of insurance policy i don't know
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
but this this at least gives them access
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
to state funds
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
without it being a loan that they would
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay back
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
to be honest
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
if my town
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
took 6 500
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
it would take them probably
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
40 years before they would amass any
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
kind of money that would really make a
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
difference to help them in this kind of
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
situation and when you take a take a
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
look at say crane brook road alone
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
three and a half miles
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
which we had finished paving
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
like two or three years prior to this
 
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.149 align:start position:0%
like two or three years prior to this
happening

02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that our town
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
had so much uh
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
saved and and and
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
worked so hard so that they could at
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
least pave this one road for three and a
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
half miles and then in one night it was
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
completely gone
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
small towns like ours we take years and
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
years and years to invest in these
 
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.950 align:start position:0%
years and years to invest in these
infrastructures

02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructures
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
and in the in the space of an evening
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's completely gone
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative petry oh i'm sorry did
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
you have another
 
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
you have another
okay

02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody in the back can answer
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
does insurance even exist for something
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have any capital reserve funds
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
to uh cover some of this
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
we do we use them all i mean
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
we we used uh fifty thousand dollars
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
from our bridge fund
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
to get we have
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh one bridge that the whole
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
underneath there's a slab on top and the
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
hole underneath of an and a culvert it's
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
a big culvert with a slab on top and the
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
whole underneath of it was washed away
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
so what we use this fifty thousand
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
was basically to have somebody come in
 
02:14:03.199 --> 02:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
was basically to have somebody come in
and

02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
blow in concrete underneath it to shore
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
it all up
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
but that's a temporary fix
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know to replace this bridge is going
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
to be like two million dollars
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
how does our town come up with that kind
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
of funding we we we have to we my town
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
has to come up uh what's uh follow a
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
question uh what's the town worth
 
02:14:25.679 --> 02:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
question uh what's the town worth
ah

02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
ah
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know roughly i mean
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know 500 million probably
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know off the top of my head
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
because usually you know yeah i don't
 
02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
because usually you know yeah i don't
know

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
well functioning a budget let's just say
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
the 2.1 million dollars that we borrowed
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
was the limit that we could get because
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
of what our town valuation was
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
we couldn't borrow any more
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
oh are you from nhma no you know oh did
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
you have another
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%

uh the faces at nhma have changed so
 
02:15:02.639 --> 02:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
uh the faces at nhma have changed so
rapidly

02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the last three months that i have no
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
idea who anyone is
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
the the same thing happened
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
hello i'm katherine heck i'm the
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%

02:15:25.199 --> 02:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
for those who agck heck like what the
heck

02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
heck
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
and for those who knew barbara reed that
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
is the job that i have taken over for i
 
02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
joined in august so there's two of us
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
that are new so um
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
so did you have any specific questions
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
for us um we didn't oppose this
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's enabling
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
we felt that if a municipality felt as
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
though they really wanted to kind of buy
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
into this type of what i would call
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
insurance policy for
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
potentially a gap
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
that has been addressed by
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative aaron if that they feel
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interest of their
 
02:16:04.079 --> 02:16:05.350 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interest of their
community

02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
we certainly wouldn't want to stop them
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have no feedback or input onto how
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
many communities would take advantage of
 
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
many communities would take advantage of
this

02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
their particular situation was
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic in my professional opinion
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
our hundred-year storms are happening
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
more and more often um so some
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
communities are able to
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
move forward with fund balance capital
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
reserves and some type of bank loan
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
before fema can come in or potentially a
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
bond if fema wouldn't be approved
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
so we can't really speak to what the
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
future holds for
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
this type of this type of event but we
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want to prohibit a
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
municipality from
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
this type of option should have become
 
02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
this type of option should have become
available

02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
represent lynn go ahead i'm sorry um we
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
heard from from the fema people just now
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
that there's not
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
the towns can't get
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
insurance for this kind of thing i'm
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
just kind of i'm just wondering
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
would this be something that if let's
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
assume that a lot of towns decided they
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
want they did want to take advantage of
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
this and they joined into it
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
would this be something
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
if they did that under the auspices of
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
fee of new hampshire municipal
 
02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.389 align:start position:0%
fee of new hampshire municipal
association

02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
is this the kind of thing that
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
nhma could get some kind of reinsurance
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
for that you would say you know
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pay out we under
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that we're going to have
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
to pay out you know every year or every
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
few years for somewhere in the state
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some kind of a
 
02:17:35.679 --> 02:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some kind of a
disaster

02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to pay out but we
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
you know we have gotten some reinsurance
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
through some insurance company or
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
whatever to be able to reimburse you
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question and that
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
would be for primex we are not part of a
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
risk pool any longer nhma primex is now
 
02:17:53.439 --> 02:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
risk pool any longer nhma primex is now
um

02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the municipal insurance company that's a
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
separate entity from nhma as of 2009 or
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
10 i believe
 
02:18:02.319 --> 02:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
10 i believe
so

02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't engage in that type of
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
reinsurance because we're not in that
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
industry but primex would be someone
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
that potentially could answer that
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
question however to my knowledge that is
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
not something the risk pool provides
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise and and maybe fema could speak
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
to this otherwise i believe that would
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
be something that would be offered
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
already in the industry okay
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions yes rip
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
some teeth um these
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
issues are not new i mean um
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
that corner of new hampshire actually i
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
think it was like in 2007 maybe
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
um experienced
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
um a really horrible horrible
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
event i i remember um
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
the governor was there and it just
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's like everything washed away um what
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
did they do then
 
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.150 align:start position:0%
did they do then
um

02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
how how do municipalities deal with um
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of an impact
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
so that they can get up and running just
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
well enough until fema or somebody else
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
can come in and do the heavy duty work
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think you're referring to what
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
they call the mother's day floods yes
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
just exactly that's right here to new
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire from new york city and
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
wondered what i was doing exactly
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah with a trailer and three small
 
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.190 align:start position:0%
um yeah with a trailer and three small
children

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:26.230 align:start position:0%
children
so

02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
in some cases when in that case i think
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
it was many state roads that that were
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
the issue and i know the state had to
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
come in and when it came to the town
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
roads fema also did did come in and help
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
us in my own town included and since
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
then there have been incidences on a
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
smaller scale and either the town has to
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
have fund balance or capital reserves or
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
they have to go to bond um if it doesn't
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions oh
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is in relation to what if
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
so what if new hampshire took some of
 
02:20:04.479 --> 02:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
so what if new hampshire took some of
that

02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund that it has in place and
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
said we're going to put 50 million
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
dollars in a pot
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the event of
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
disaster but
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
the towns and municipalities would take
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
it as a loan
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
and would have to pay it back
 
02:20:24.399 --> 02:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
and would have to pay it back
unfortunately

02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
that money has to be
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
expense would which is it rick uh mickey
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
by 2026 so that that's not even a
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%

02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%

uh i'm sure we'll be seeing you at least
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
around the hallways
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
if not uh enjoying a visit with us so
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay i need to do some thinking about
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:25.670 align:start position:0%
this bill
uh

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
we also
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think need to read
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh 21p colon 37
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
which is that sb 409
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
and i think we also need to look at sb
 
02:22:40.479 --> 02:22:43.270 align:start position:0%
and i think we also need to look at sb
402

02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
402
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
which is the bill that's i don't know if
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's past the senate or
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.359 --> 02:22:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes so i was to the hearing for sb 402
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
and i think and it's still in committee
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been voted out of committee
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
the finance committee of the senate yet
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that they had with that bill
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that that bill provides for the state
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
to pick up 12 and a half percent and the
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
municipality to pick up 12 and a half
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
percent of the 25 that's matched with
 
02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:22.389 align:start position:0%
percent of the 25 that's matched with
fema

02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
fema
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the problem that they had with that
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
at least what senator chuck morris was
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
expressing was that they had no idea of
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
how much money 12 and a half percent
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
represented in terms of
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
what they would have to as a senate
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
set aside for an appropriation from the
 
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.190 align:start position:0%
set aside for an appropriation from the
state

02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
state
because

02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
there there was no number
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
of how much
 
02:23:47.359 --> 02:23:49.190 align:start position:0%
of how much
money

02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
individual municipalities was going to
 
02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
individual municipalities was going to
claim

02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
claim
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
to fema for their projects
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
so they had no
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
what that 12 and a half percent
 
02:24:01.439 --> 02:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
what that 12 and a half percent
represented

02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why this bill is kind of just
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
sitting there in finance right now they
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
haven't made a decision
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess they're trying to get more
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
information about what 12 and a half
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
percent would equate to from from
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh state
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
allocation do you have like a five-year
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
average of fema
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
that you could
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh give us some sort of indication as to
 
02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh give us some sort of indication as to
yeah

02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:32.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
oh i don't need you to go back that far
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah if if you could just give us
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
something that would um
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
estimate what that sure i can send that
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
to mickey and we've also um with senator
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
khan have provided some information
 
02:24:47.359 --> 02:24:48.230 align:start position:0%
khan have provided some information
about

02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
their going off of
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
a little disaster history or education
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
for you is when we do the preliminary
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
damage assessments with fema that gives
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
us the initial amount to say to the
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
president we've hit this threshold and
 
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:00.710 align:start position:0%
president we've hit this threshold and
so

02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the last um time we met and
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong but they based the numbers
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
off of that about six and a half million
 
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
or so
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
which we think will likely be higher but
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know but also
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
just this week we heard that they're in
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
dc trying to work towards a 90 10 split
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
so some information came out this week
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
that might help out
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
with 402 so but yes we i can provide the
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
last few disasters information to yeah
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
it would be good over like a couple
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
years anyhow a couple three years
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
because it's uh
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know disasters vary from year to
 
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
year yeah absolutely in
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
the southwest corner
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't get hit often but when they do
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
it it's pretty big so yeah yeah yeah and
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
i and i i
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
know that in that area
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative aaron is talking about
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of the damage was not to
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
state roads
 
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it was to uh local roads which um
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think the state
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
did all the work on the state roads
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
but um yeah and back in 2005 2006 2007
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
we had three consecutive years of storms
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
the alstead mother's day and then the
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
october storms as well in um similar
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
situation and that's where the split 12
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
and a half split came from and so from
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
2005 disasters to 2011 the state paid
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
that 12 and a half percent and it went
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
away in 2011 um but that came as a
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
direct result of those disasters that it
 
02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.510 align:start position:0%
direct result of those disasters that it
hit

02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
hit
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the state roads had hit a lot
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
but boston was like wiped off the map
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to some other communities so
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
the good news is all the mitigation work
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
that we did after that
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
held up and hasn't been re-impacted but
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
to get there takes a little bit so and
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
i understand fema will
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
support mitigation efforts yup yup we
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
have a whole mitigation program at our
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
office that works with fema
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's additional funding for
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
mitigation that was not disaster
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
impacted so we have several
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for funding but with a
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
disaster declaration they look at
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
two kind of phases getting the
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
facility the roads in this case back to
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
like day before storm level and then
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
we'll also look at mitigation to improve
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
it to make it so it doesn't happen again
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
i mean that's all under done under
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
public assistance and then we have our
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
mitigation program that looks at
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
primarily non-disaster
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
or impacted things and affects that as
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
well that you can have been in a blue
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
sky day or fix in a blue sky day rather
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
so yeah we have lots of funding
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities yeah we're looking for
 
02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.110 align:start position:0%
opportunities yeah we're looking for
money

02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
up in uh
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
north conway yeah for uh saco river that
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't know where it wants to go
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
changes on the daily yeah it you know
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
she talked about blue sky
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know what what what the soccer was
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
like yesterday
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
is not the same as it was the day before
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
or the day after so yeah
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
they've talked about meandering
 
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:07.429 align:start position:0%
they've talked about meandering
rivers

02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
rivers
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know what this does but it
 
02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.309 align:start position:0%
i don't know what this does but it
certainly

02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay anywhere near its own path
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the suncook river completely
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
changed direction a number of years ago
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that a large yep yep that was a
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
large mitigation project that we did
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
there as well with fema so
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
yeah this one the the is eating our
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
hungry yeah
 
02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:33.910 align:start position:0%
hungry yeah
yeah

02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
what the heck
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
anyhow we'll keep smiling and um
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
i guess uh if there's nothing else we
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
will meet again on
 
02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
will meet again on
monday

02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
i believe it's at ten o'clock
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.590 --> 02:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:02.309 align:start position:0%
is that right
yes

02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
three we have three education bills
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then we uh on uh
 
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
wednesday of next week will be the
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
executive session so we'll
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
if anybody has anything um
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
on these three education bills that
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
they think will need an amendment well
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
we'll need to
 
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
get that moving
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.920 --> 02:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
i'm considering that we may make a small
 
02:30:09.439 --> 02:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
i'm considering that we may make a small
allocation

02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the same way that we
 
02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
uh in the same way that we
did

02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the police standards uh and maybe
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
give them uh
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
six months worth of
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
but that's i you know
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's not up to me that's
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
up to
 
02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
up to
you

02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
you
okay

02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
so in that case
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see you
 
02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
we'll see you
tomorrow

02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
you
