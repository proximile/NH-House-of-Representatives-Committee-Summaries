Program

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
Program
 
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and um it's I think the second
 
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting um we've had um and
 
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
at our last subcommittee meeting there
 
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
was a discussion about um uh various uh
 
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
topics uh but one of them was uh College
 
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
preparation programs um in State and
 
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
um uh that is part of what is in HB
 
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
437 is an annual report um by the
 
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
department in relation to the um College
 
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
preparation programs and um their um
 
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
efforts um in um reading
 
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
literacy um so I think um Mr applebe
 
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
from the Department is here with uh uh a
 
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
couple of people I don't know if you all
 
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
three want to join at the same
 
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
chair just
 
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
rest um so
 
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we talked about um
 
00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
last meeting uh I believe was um the
 
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
report uh the recent report on College
 
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
preparation from the uh
 
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
National Council on teacher quality that
 
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
they did um and um it was thought uh
 
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
that it would be um worthwhile to get
 
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
more information on what's going on um
 
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
at some of New Hampshire colleges so so
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
um Mr applebe would you like to
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
Keen
 
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
great um so uh looking at that teacher
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
quality um program uh I think that uh
 
00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
Kean actually had the uh best rating um
 
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so uh would you like to
 
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 align:start position:0%
maybe start things off by telling us um
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the teacher prep
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
program at
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
Keane sure I'm happy to talk about our
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
programs um do you want me to talk about
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
it in reference to literacy yes please
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
um I figured it might help folk because
 
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
I could do two hours and just prep um so
 
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
in literacy I will say uh I I am the
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
director of V prep but I was I came to
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
Keen State um as a professor in special
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
education and my focus was in literacy
 
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
so in about
 
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
2016 we created a committee because we
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
realized the elementary education
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
program and early childhood need more
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
needed more in the area of literacy we
 
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like our students were truly
 
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
prepared so we made some shifts in our
 
00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 align:start position:0%
program and I sat on a committee and you
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
know being the literacy person I was
 
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
reading through the stuff you know we
 
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
framed our literacy course based on the
 
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
national reading panel and what was
 
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
evidence Bas and we created a literacy
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
course that was at a foundation course
 
00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
that taught the concepts to our students
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
and it's open to anybody who wants to
 
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
take it but mainly our early childhood
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
and our elementary um candidates would
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
take this course and it really talked
 
00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
about literacy developmentally from
 
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 align:start position:0%
birth on it covered you know anything
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
from when we say literacy from oral
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
language to reading to writing to all
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
those areas but it set the foundation so
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
that they were ready to enter methods
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
one specifically I'll speak on our
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
elementary because when they entered our
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
methods one which is an 8 Credit course
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
um meaning that they have half Field
 
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
Time half instruction time they were
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
ready to start working on teaching
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
literacy in the classroom so our methods
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
one focuses on literacy and social
 
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
studies so that was kind of the the
 
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
corep of what we did we made those
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
changes um and the other piece that we
 
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 align:start position:0%
also did is that we made a change in our
 
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
elementary ad program where students
 
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
could not enter student teaching until
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
they passed the foundations of reading
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
test and the practice too so that meant
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
that they had all those tests under
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
their belt but it also meant that they
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
were at that literacy level so that when
 
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
they stepped in their student teaching
 
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 align:start position:0%
they were able to step in and teach and
 
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
instruct and really get into that
 
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
student teaching experience so those are
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
things that we did I can speak just
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to Keen state to help kind
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
of develop that literacy which we think
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
is really important for our teachers to
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
know before they enter the um classroom
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
does that help okay uh thank you uh so
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding um and please correct
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
me if I'm mistaken but the foundations
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
of reading
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
is aligned with the
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based research and science of
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
reading research that has been done yes
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead yes I I would add that
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
that shift for the alignment with the
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
science of reading and the foundations
 
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
of reading assessment didn't happen
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
until I believe 2016 or
 
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
2017 so when you look at Pass rates for
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
example um you'll see a vast difference
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the Align with the
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
assessment and after the okay for the
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
better yes yes right and I I think the
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
survey that uh um we looked at I I think
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
I passed out last time the executive
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
summary was I think TW 2022 or 23 2022 I
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
guess probably it was so
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay um would would you like to talk
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
about uh um generally in the state um
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
the reading literacy teacher
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
prep sure so I'm going into my fourth
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
year I believe um as the administrator
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
overseeing our Ed prep programs and uh
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
we currently have 12 institutions uh
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
that have approved Ed prep programs uh
 
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
ironically um two of them do not or one
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
do not offer LED where the remaining
 
00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
institutions do um that's said um some
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the work that we just completed was
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh re-examining our approval process uh
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
for our edep programs and as part of
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
that along with the onboarding of Kate
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
mcaffrey who's in the back there um our
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
our next step will be looking at
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
examining um some requirements specific
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
to five different lure areas around uh
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
the evidence with science of reading um
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
and implementing those we're hoping to
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
move those through within the next uh
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
year um to ensure that there is a
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
minimum uh expectation of our Ed preps
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
within the state um and then what would
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
that look like and how we roll it
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
out and when you talk about the uh lure
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
um you are you referring to um specific
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
licenses for um educator yes positions
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
so uh currently that would be in

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
elementary separately in theory it's a
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
one set of Standards with an additional
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for the K8 piece um but it
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
really is two different licenses so uh
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
and I just want to weigh in at at this
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
time uh it is not a requirement
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rule uh we're hoping
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
again over over the next year to that
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
the state board will move forward with
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
the proposal to add a requirement of
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
passing foundations of reading for
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher and early childhood
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher today that test is
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
not a requirement of those two
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
endorsements it is a requirement of the
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
two LED endorsements early childhood and
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the two Reading Writing Reading Writing
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
endorsements one of the I would just add
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
one last thing one of the things in in
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
relation to our Ed prep programs as part
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
of the review uh process with and
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
standards would be looking at uh some
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
type of mechanism uh to include an
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
observation during their clinical hours
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
of uh reading and writing
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
observation great um any initial
 
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.590 align:start position:0%
observation great um any initial
questions

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
or well I'll I'll ask another one then
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
um maybe um back to what's going on at
 
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
Keen um the uh National Council
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
survey um looked at VAR the what maybe
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
referred to as the Five Pillars yep um
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
which include pheic awareness phonics
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
fluency vocabulary and comprehensive
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
comprehension um and looked at them
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
based on um a number of factors
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
including instructional hours um and we
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
sort of uh uh in the legislation mimic
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
that in terms of what the state is to
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
report on um annually as from each of
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
the colleges um could you talk a little
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
um those five pillars and um how they're
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh how the instruction is done at
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
Keen oh wow that's a um that's like a
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
semester course yeah um well because I
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
taught the literacy course when we teach
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
the Five Pillars
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
and and I will speak when I teach the
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
course so I can put it on my my my own
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
name but we want our teachers to
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
understand the development that happens
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
in the area of literacy um it doesn't
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
begin when they enter kindergarten um
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
and we also don't know and it's
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
important for future teachers to
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
understand the developmental piece
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't always know what
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
students are having before they come
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
into kindergarten so our teachers have
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
to be prepared for where the students
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
are and what experiences and what
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge they come in with because
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's you can't consequence students
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
for what they haven't had but you have
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
to know where they are so you can
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
develop the skills and help them catch
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
up um so we talk from uh the importance
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
of oral language in uh learning um uh
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
the importance of scribbling and all
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
these pieces and mimicking what we say
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
and also the rich vocabulary knowledge
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
how the words we use with our students
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
is important and uh reading um books so
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
these are some of those foundational
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
things but generally children when they
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
are in a a preschool setting they get
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
some of the basics of pheic awareness
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
phological awareness and the
 
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
alphabetical knowledge but not all
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
students have those experience before
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
they come into kindergarten which is
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
another reason why this phonemic
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
awareness is so important to teach our
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
students because they have to understand
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
the difference between phic awareness
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
and phonics phic awareness is the
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
manipulation of sounds and individual
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
sounds and a student ability to break
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
apart these words into the sound l
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
really plays this foundation in their
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
ability to learn phonics and start
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
decoding and
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
reading um but also the oral language
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
and some of those pieces also come into
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
play when they're learning to read the
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
rich vocabulary knowledge and also in
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
the end the ultimate goal is
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
comprehension so all these pieces
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
teaching it through a developmental lens
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
but also teaching how all these aspects
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
that you talked about the elements play
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
into this ultimate goal and also
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
interact with each other is important
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times teachers will say
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
oh a student struggling with
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
comprehension are they struggling with
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
comprehension you won't know until you
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
do some of these informal assessments to
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
really understand what is affecting
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
their ability to comprehend what they're
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
reading and it's understanding all these
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
various elements that allow teachers to
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
tease apart and develop instruction that
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
 
students

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
have set number of
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
um instructional hours uh for instance
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
um for the different categories
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
different pillars um how does how does
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
it work uh practically in terms of um
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
their course uh work so we don't I know
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
the nctq does they they look at our
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
sylli and schedule and then they
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
calculate ours we break it to have um
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
equal kind of especially in our literacy
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
course like time on each of the elements
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
because they kind of flow into into each
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
other but then we also know that all
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
that comes back in our methods where
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
they review it again but then it becomes
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
the practical application in the lesson
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
planning that comes into it they don't
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
have to take the time in the methods
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
course to for them to understand the
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
concepts or to really have some basic
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
ideas on how to teach it and assess it
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
they get to take it to that next level
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%
so our instructional hours when we do it
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
we also think about that wraparound so
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
they get the first con you know learning
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
of it in the literacy course it comes
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
back into methods so there's more
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
instructional hours and the practical
 
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:35.759 align:start position:0%
application and the observations in the
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
schools um and then the third time it
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
comes around is in our student teaching
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
for elementary education where we do
 
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
have one of our key assessments that is
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
tied specifically to literacy there is
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
actually we do have an observation that
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
is liter based on teaching literacy um
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it's also for our students to
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand I think the last element to
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
add is that in our LED program because
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
it is K to 6 we ensure that um through
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
our methods one methods 2 and student
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
teaching that they have different grade
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
experiences so we try to have it where
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
they have you know a kindergarten first
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
and uh a second third and a fourth fifth
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
so that they not only learn literacy but
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
they get to experience how it is you
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
know the focus or what it looks like in
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
kindergarten versus 2 fourth fifth
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
six can can I just add I think one of
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
the things that um is a strength of keen
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
state is they're very methodical in in
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
those three components between
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
introduction of the knowledge and the
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
skills and the concepts so that would be
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
part one and then there's a practice of
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
those and then where they demonstrate
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
individually and so that there is
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
purpose in how and when that happens
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
which I think um Builds on that strength
 
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
of learning and and implementing those
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programs
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
um there are differences and it depends
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
on how and when and the emphasis and how
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
and when that those um skills are put
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
into place and then subsequently the
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation piece that you know there
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's a end component you know an
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
assessment component from the
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
institution with the candidates um that
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're analyzing their ability to
 
00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:37.710 align:start position:0%
they're analyzing their ability to
demonstrate

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
explicitly um M yeah represent
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you very much uh uh Dean SZ
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
for u u uh joining us this morning in
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
fact your whole your whole team uh today
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if we could sort of
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
step back a little bit from the from the
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know uh teacher prep that you're
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
doing at keen and and if you could talk
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit about um the instructional
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
methods that are being used by um by
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
teaching fa you know K3 um teachers
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
across the state today and um and how
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
are um our
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
K3 um students are um you know uh
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
performing in general and um and what
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
sort of specific
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations um you you have going
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
forward oh wow
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that well so you asked me the
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
question so I'll speak honestly I think
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things and I was reading
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
through the bill and everything is that
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of schools because they
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
want to prepare teachers they rely on
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
programs and programs aren't the answer
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
they may have elements that help with
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
the teaching but what we do is we teach
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
students how future teachers how to
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
teach literacy how to base it they know
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
what needs to be taught and how to use
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
different elements to truly teach and I
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
think that it's empowering the teachers
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
today to go back to that not feel like
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
they have to rely on programs but rely
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
on evidence-based practices and and we
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
do prepare our teachers to come out and
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
they know they get a chance to to
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
practice it to to create lessons and to
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
do it in a classroom but then they enter
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
a school and if they enter a school
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
where they're the new teacher it is
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to be like wait this is best
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
practice when maybe they're handed this
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
is the program we're using at this
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
school um so I I think that schools are
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
really doing the best that they can and
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
they are really working with the diverse
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
population of students because there's a
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
lot of things going on in schools that
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
are Beyond just literacy so I want to
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they are working with
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the school the students that are in
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
their classroom but I think it's
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
empowering teachers to do what they're
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
taught to do how do we get it where they
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability to look at their
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
students to do informal assessments to
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
know what they need and create lessons
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
that really meet their needs how do we
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
have these programs that become things
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
that they can use but not something that
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
they have to use or how do they use it
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's really best to serve their
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
students based on the evidence and not
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
feeling like they just have to use the
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
program because that's the program that
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
um was purchased for them to
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
use clarification on on that thank you
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
very much um so when you when you talk
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
about that this empowers teachers to be
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
able to to to um to use
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh instruction practices
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
are you talking about house bille 437
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
does that or that your teacher prep um
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
your your the the training you do and
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the instruction that you provide at
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
Keen State sets teachers up for that
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
well I know that our our preparation
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
does set them up for that I did notice
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill and I did read There were
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
times that you um said instruction which
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
was really good and then there's times I
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
saw program so that's where I make that
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
reference um because I think program you
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
know and when you think about all the
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
science of reading and what it came out
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
it was really an attack on programs that
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
are being used in the schools not not um
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
the instruction that is being used in
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
schools so it's and I think that by
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
opening it up to instruction it also
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
allows for professional development to
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
happen and I know right now the state is
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
offering the letters program that a lot
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
of uh teachers are signing up for it
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
allows teachers to learn those skills
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then start applying them into their
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms okay and then another part of
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the question too I want to make sure
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
we get this question had a lot there a
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
lot packed into it um is um how are I
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
mean obviously you know being being
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
being a a a critical factor in in
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
preparing teachers and um uh to uh to
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
work with all of our our kids across the
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
state um obviously there's a feedback
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
loop um called how are the kids doing
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and I was wonder if you could
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that and and um
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
and obviously we've been through a lot
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and we're only
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
talking you know K3 um in a lot of this
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these K3 kids all they've
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
known as pandemic um you know life and
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
at least in school and um uh but I was
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could sort of reflect
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
on that and and also going back maybe
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know over over a longer period cuz
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
obviously you know we've been teaching
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
kids long for a long time now and um and
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know Grandparents were kids one days
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
parents were kids at one time and now
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
kids are kids yeah so um and you could
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
just sort of talk about how um how these
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
these different Generations have been
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
doing wow um so
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because when I teach a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
literacy course I teach my students I
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
say when I learned how to read it was
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
whole language and I remember the
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
struggles I went through learning how to
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
read it was and even now when I go to
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
spell I have to see the word because I
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
didn't learn how to spell and to read
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
phonetically even though I learned how
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
to teach the Next Generation but the
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
things that I was taught as a child are
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
still the way that my brain functions
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
and works and I use that as an example
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
for my students because I say you know a
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
lot of us learned how to overcome or how
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
to navigate some of these things but
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
imagine what would have happened if I
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
would have been taught you know bonics
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
or phic awareness as a child and not
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
have had those struggles with reading
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
and writing that I may have encountered
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was something I I definitely gained
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
strength over my experience in time but
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
it was something so when I'm teaching
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
them phonics I said or you know were
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
doing letter sounds in class I'm sitting
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
there going this is something I had to
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
teach myself and this is not something
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's natural which is why I like to
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
teach it to you so it's something that
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
you're teaching the Next
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
Generation and I think that we have a
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
lot more assessments now that evaluate
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
students and and there are pros and cons
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
to standardize assessments you know in
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
the past we just trusted that the
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
teachers were teaching and students were
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
doing well and we took SATs we went to
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
college and we went on there wasn't this
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
accountability that we have um in place
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
now that you know when I was young or
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
Generations past and there's again pros
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
and cons everything so standardized
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
testing there is a value in the data but
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's also a sample of one moment and
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
it's a sample did the students do what
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
we know they can do and I and so I
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
always try to remind my students what
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
standardized testing is and also that we
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we don't overuse
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
standardized testing because now we have
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of students coming into to college
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
that there they have this aversion to
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
testing or they come in saying I have
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
anxiety to testing and all these things
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
that come in because of this the the
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
testing that they've experienced so
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
we're trying to shift that
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
but understanding that they standardized
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
testing and my job is to also teach my
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
students how to do informal assessments
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
what are these assessments that allow us
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
to really understand what is happening
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
with these students they're embedded in
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
the classroom they don't take over a
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
class and they really capture students
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
progression in a more authentic way and
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
then when it comes to the standardized
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
testing we know what it is and it's at a
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
point that we can say okay this is the
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
the big stamp but it's it's
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
understanding I think that's the
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
difference is in our generation we are
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
trying to become much more informed when
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
we're creating lessons and knowing where
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
our students are and really creating
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
lessons that are differentiated to meet
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
their needs instead of just teaching to
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the whole class and expecting everyone
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
to be at the same place did that answer
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
there was a lot
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
did I answer
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
anything I I would add to that as I I
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
call myself a recovering School
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
administrator I was a school principal
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
and assistant principal principal intern
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
for 17 years um I if you have districts
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
that have the ability and the knowledge
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
and um staff faculty that are willing
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
you can really uh capitalize on what uh
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
Dr stz was just talking about with both
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh response to intervention y or a
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems and support so that
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
you you're actually able to get to that
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
granular level of where the students are
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
at to to fill those gaps or give the
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
students what they need to get them to
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
where they need to be and that may mean
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that my class of 25
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
students goes beyond the wall of my 25
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
that may mean that I'm responsible for
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
teaching other classroom students and
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
other teachers are responsible for
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
teaching mine that there's a collective
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
share of um the education of the child
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
rather than it's just one person having
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
all the skills all it's it's impossible
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh for one individual to have all the
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
skills that every child needs every year
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
um with the diverse needs um both
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
educationally and and otherwise um but
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
looking at you know those informal
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
assess ments and benchmarking um and how
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
you are moving the students um to really
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
maximize your resources with uh the
 
00:26:36.919 --> 00:26:41.710 align:start position:0%
maximize your resources with uh the
student

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
needs thank you and thanks thanks for
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
being here I've got a couple questions
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
one's that's kind of a general one which
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe beyond your purview but I'm
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about the role that parents
 
00:26:57.399 --> 00:26:58.470 align:start position:0%
concerned about the role that parents
play

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
play in the reading of their children
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
learning to
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
read and you may not have any data on
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
this but have you looked at the issue of
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh what's happening in in homes for
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
example uh are parents reading to
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
children are there books in this are
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
there books in the home are parents in
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
fact reading their own books uh as uh to
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
create a culture of reading uh within
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
the home so uh do you have that that's
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
my first General ER question and you
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
know it's you're smiling so I know
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
smiling because there are so many layers
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
to this there there really is there is
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
evidence about the number of books in
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
her home and all those things but I
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
really try to teach my students um why
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's really important for us to
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
understand that parents in general they
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
have the best interests for their
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
children but they may not always have
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the capacity or ability to to um do all
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
these things or time and um
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
and they may not have have had struggles
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
themselves so I I I tried to make sure
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
that when future teachers understand
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
that our job as Educators is not to
 
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
judge families or to say why didn't they
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
do this but to say where are these
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
students and what do they need and what
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
can I do to rich or send books home or
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
do things that may help the student
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
continue to grow so it's shifting our
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
role of looking at what is it that we
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
can do and um engage in that versus
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of things that
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
happen in the home and and I think that
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
changing it from why to oh I wonder why
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
like changing the way that we look at
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
families because then it became becomes
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
this schools are supposed to be places
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
where families feel welcomed and come in
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
and we work with them and if there's a
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
judgment or why didn't you do this then
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
it causes families to not want to be
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
part of that learning process so our job
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
is to welcome the families in and find
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
ways to work together and support them
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
and find out what they need and what we
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
can do to help them so I came up because
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
part of our um this is Kate mcaf from
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
the Department yeah I oversee the
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
literacy initiatives and one of our
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
initiatives is parents so parents on the
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
love of reading and we had a marketing
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
company actually survey New Hampshire
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
parents and surprisingly parents are
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
reading and they are going to libraries
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
and they did respond favorably that they
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
are reading to their children at night
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
and so we've used that data we are going
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
to re-evaluate after the campaign to see
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
if they've increased um as a pre- and a
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
post assessment but it was pretty
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
favorable that parents were reading with
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
their children great thank you very much
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
the second question do you have some I
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
was just going to add to um I think it's
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
also at the school level having been
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
there it it's about how you encourage
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
families the the dynamic of even
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
just I don't want to get in trouble by
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
my boss um of when I was in school that
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of homes were a two parent home uh
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
with one person most likely staying at
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
home who had the ability and the time uh
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
to be able to expose and talk Anders and
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
um you know go outside of the home and
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
look at signs and read um in the grocery
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
store Etc that isn't necessarily the
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
case nowadays um you know so it is a
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
huge part of the schools to to help
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
families understand that reading doesn't
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
have to be sitting down looking at a
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
book it can be in the car as you're
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
driving you know and you're looking at
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
the signs as you're as you're going by
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
it can be in the grocery store you know
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
while you're you're picking out grer
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
groceries and you know what's listed on
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
on the box or the bag or whatever that
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
there are so many elements that families
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
can do that sometimes they aren't aware
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
that um that's even part of reading um
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
and exposing them to students to to the
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
language and the
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
vocabulary um of the world around them
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
um but it it's there is evidence that um
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know the the household is quite
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
different nowadays most uh parents are
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
are working parents so that the time
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
that they have uh to be able to provide
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is is not like it used to be so
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
schools have taken you know the added
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of you know how do we
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
help share that and how do we help
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
support parents with what they do have
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
with what they do have so thank you so
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
the second question is I guess directed
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
that Mr
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
applebe he was feeling left out as as we
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
look at this program from Keen State and
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
you work with other highered
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
institutions um is their program uh
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
reflective of what's happening in other
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation programs around the
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
state uh thank you for the question I
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
think um I think Keen is an example of
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
probably without without inflating their
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
egos too much probably of our an
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
Exemplar of what we would look for and
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
um the other 11 programs you know
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
there's variations they're good in some
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
areas they have worked to do in other
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
areas um you know and and right
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately there is always work to do to
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
improve but I think that you know in the
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
case of Kean which is I think our second
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
largest overall program in the state
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
might be our largest now um but they
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
would be what everyone should aspire to
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'm I've got one third one
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
here so as we look at you know one of
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that this committee
 
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
always has to deal with and that is as
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
we pass and recommend
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislation U is its impact upon local
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
decisions and granted there are as you
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
have indicated there are multiple
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
approaches uh to looking at at reading
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
whether it be phonetics whether it be L
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
the other the open stuff you were
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
talking about so the question that I
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
really have U is the is do you feel that
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation and
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
we just have got an amendment here from
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative cordellia this morning
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
but in
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
general do you view that uh a state
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
mandate or a state law is needed to
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
dictate a particular approach to reading
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
and how does that impact local decision
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
making as it relates to their review of
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
their student population Etc and the
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
needs of that
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.470 align:start position:0%
needs of that
population

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I I think with reading you know I'm A
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
literacy person so I I definitely um
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
want uh all our teachers to be prepared
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
and to engage and to prepare you know
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
teach our students these skills I think
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
my one worry is and I think it would be
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
important to maybe talk to um you know
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
Elementary School principles and
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
teachers is the workload implications um
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
is this out of work do they have time
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
because I know that schools are stretch
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
thin as is and so the only thing that's
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
only with having the standardized
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
testing you know I think it says here
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
what three times a year you know how is
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
that going to affect their ability to
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
teach or to to do the work that they
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
need to do um and understanding too that
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of schools now do a universal
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
screening when they come in as
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
kindergarten because the goal is not to
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
say we're identifying students who have
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities but to know where
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
students are so that they know how what
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
what to teach and what the students need
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
and to to um offer um instruction that
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
is differentiated for the population
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's coming in so I do think that
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
having a standardized maybe at the end
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
of kindergarten I think at the
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten year we have to allow the
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
teachers to do what they are trained to
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
do and really help students gain the
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
skills that may they may not have had
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
before that um maybe the use of informal
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
versus standardized more often but I
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
think this is a conversation to really
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
have with the teachers and to see what
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
their days look like and what the impact
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
classrooms I'm not sure I got an answer
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
to my question let me let me repeat it
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
again sure does the state law need to
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
take place to mandate an approach to
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
reading Visa local decision making
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
reflecting of the of the students and
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
the culture that they bring to
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
school I don't think there's anything I
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything against having a
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
bill just making sure a law for literacy
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
I just make sure I mean the areas are
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but making sure the
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
language is flexible enough that it can
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
change as evidence you know as the
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
research continues to change as schools
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
continue to change so it's supportive
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
and something that can grow as um
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
as you know instead of being something
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
that is timestamped in a moment is that
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
better yeah and I reiterate that they
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
already are screening twice a year yes
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
um kindergarten through third and you're
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
just adding a midyear or an end of the
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah repres luno thank you very much Mr
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I'd like to um follow up um Dr
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
STS on on representative Myers's uh uh
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
question and and really get um really
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
get specific in terms of what we need to
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
do um in New Hampshire and um and
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
section three of um of the um the the
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
draft amendment that representative
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh handed out uh you know
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
establishes a mandate all school
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
districts which provide Elementary
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
education shall dot dot dot and and U
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
and it it it basically uh literacy
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
instruction instruction shall be
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
measurable evidence-based reflective
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
science of reading research and it goes
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
down and I think um enumerates what what
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
being reflective of the science uh of
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
reading research is and um and I want to
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
sort of flash this up ju deposed with
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
with some other department um
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives that would um would would
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
reduce or eliminate credentialing in a
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
lot of um in a lot of areas and I'd like
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
to get your professional opinion on
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
what's more important um uh to have in
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
front of um uh of early you know K3 kids
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
um would it be more important to have a
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
specific program that that did something
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and a and a guide that can sort
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
of move a student through the program or
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
deliver the cover the content of the of
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
the program uh or or in your opinion
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
have a um uh a press a professionally
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
trained uh instructor that that has a
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
has a background of knowledge in
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices both in terms
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
of content and instruction and um and
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
have that person uh in front of um uh
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
the child being able to um to recognize
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
the as you said earlier the differences
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
that that that kid's exhibit well you
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
know as somebody who um I'm I'm also the
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
lens your officer I should just have
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
like a long line of of what I do I
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
always look at our candidates and say
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
what I want this teacher what I feel
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with them teaching my own
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
children right and so I do believe that
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
we need to have qualified trained
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
teachers in front of the classroom I do
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
um that are leading the work in literacy
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that will make the bigger
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
imp act in our schools than just having
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
a program and I think the problem with
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
programs is that they never cover
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
everything it's just it's it's a box
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's brought in and somebody reads it
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
but there's so many nuances to teaching
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
that that box can't bring and that's
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
what qualified teachers do bring to a
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
classroom um I don't think that and
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
that's where I said programs can be used
 
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
where there's elements used to it but I
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
think along if you want something that
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
works in a classroom it's not only
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
having the qualified teachers and you're
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
talking kada 3 but it's also preparing
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
our tutors and Pa professionals to also
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
support the teacher and the support the
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
learning in the classroom so I think
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's a tiered level of knowledge that
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be in that classroom to really
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
students um if oh I'm sorry okay I might
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
be backtracking just a little but um
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
what I was curious about is uh this
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
I'm on page four of the updated version
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
11 Roman numeral 11 about this report
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like a specific report is
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
being asked for about these programs
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
based on the content of this bill but
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
what my question is is before Mr applebe
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
you were talking
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
about the basically how Keen State's
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
doing a good job and there's 11 other
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
programs in the state I guess my
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
question is um and this might just be my
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
not being a newbie not having read the
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
whole green book of laws but are there
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
other evaluations how how are the
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
programs these 12 then programs um being
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
evaluated are there other reports so
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
this would be an additional report being
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
asked for um where else can you find
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
information um on the other programs
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
including sure so the programs are
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
either reviewed um by the state uh
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
through a process under a state review
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
or they can receive national
 
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.990 align:start position:0%
or they can receive national
accreditation

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
accreditation
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and that gives them for their
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
approval and part of that is including
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
the Ed prep standards that are required
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and at the very
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of our conversation today I
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
explained some of the work that we're
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
doing now that we're hoping to roll out
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
in the next 6 to 12 months are including
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
specific standards relative to science
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
of reading within our Ed prep programs
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
and our administrative rules allow us to
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
do that um to include and then will have
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
mechanisms uh in place that some of that
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
will not only be
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
um how the institutions are
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrating where that information is
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
within their programs um but they report
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
out on any changes in in rules Etc um
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
annually to the
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
department I can just add to that um
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
sorry the um administrative rules were
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
recently updated by the state board and
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
strengthened in this area uh and uh
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's more granularity now in the
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
rules which should make um Laura's job a
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
little easier when it comes to reviewing
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
programs and presenting those findings
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education and
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
additionally you asked about where you
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
could find this information uh it is
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
always included in the monthly State
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Education packet any program
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
reviews that have been completed or in
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
right good um if I could just mention I
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
would add to just one L there there is
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
an annually published uh approval uh for
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
the programs within the state of New
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that is also available on
 
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
website and you'll see in there also if
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
if the institution has obtained full
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
approval uh conditional approval meaning
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
there are unmet standards that impact
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
the program and uh programs that are
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
being eliminated or closed
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
out um I just wanted to mention that um
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
we did incorporate in here that the
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
department would make available to the
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
local districts um guidance on
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate instructional materials uh
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
to help the districts in that regard um
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of the assessments um
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
beginning middle and end um and between
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
I've talked to teachers who do it more
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
frequently um and I actually uh attended
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
a professional development session um
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
for um uh teachers involved in reading
 
00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
for um uh teachers involved in reading
and

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
literacy um and um the presenter was an
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent from a district
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts who went over what they
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
did and they had um
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
extensive data
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
collected um from these assessments for
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
each student um that the teachers and
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
others put into
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets um to track a student
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
progress um I'm hoping we wouldn't have
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
to do that I I believe there there are
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
products out there that will do much of
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
that um based on the assessment um I
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
have this is just one because I was most
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
most L familiar with that I've got just
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of handouts but I can mail it
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
around um uh this is the company that
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
does the dible
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
assessment um and they capture um data
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
um from that assessment and help build
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
interventions and um some of the data
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
that the people in um uh Massachusetts
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
are trying to have the teachers put into
 
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:26.839 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that done you know
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
automatically for them in addition to
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
having a parent portal so you know I
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
would hope that um we we could move in
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
the direction of a system like that that
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
um will um have an automated component
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
to help uh teachers track uh that
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
information rather than uh being a data
 
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
information rather than uh being a data
entry

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
entry
 
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
entry
person

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh I was also um feedback was mentioned
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
I think by David by representative luno
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering um if you've gotten
 
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.630 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering um if you've gotten
feedback

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
from students who have graduated and
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
gone into the classroom and I've heard
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
stories of and you've reiterated
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
teachers you know learning from what
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
you've uh taught at keing state but then
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
maybe finding something different in a
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
program at the elementary school where
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
they uh where they have um been hired um
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
do you get feedback from graduating
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
students on you know what they're
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing in the field uh yes and um
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
well we we go through a cape national
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
accreditation and one of the
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for our Cape national
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
accreditation is that we have to for
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
standard four is follow up on our
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
completers to evaluate the effectiveness
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
of our programs and their satisfaction
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
of our programs and there's also an
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
Outreach to um uh to our graduates to do
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
focus groups to ask about like changes
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
they would make and to their employers
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
who have hired our graduates so that is
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
data that we have to collect and we
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
actually use for our continuous
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
Improvement and um literacy has not it
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
was years ago when we made the changes
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
was one of the things that uh some of
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
our candidates said that they had wish
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
they had more preparation and and that's
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
how we responded as we created a class
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
that really um added a whole another
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
level of literacy before they entered
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
methods so that was one of the things
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we used in response to the feedback
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
we got from not only our Lum but we also
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
have what's called an educator
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
preparation advisory Council that has um
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh my you know a couple of us but it has
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh cooperating professionals that we
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
work with it has principes it has
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent so it has people in the
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
field so that we get their feedback as
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
well when we're making um decisions so
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
we do use that feedback
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
the feedback uh in our last round for
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
our Cape accreditation a lot most of
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
them felt more prepared in the area of
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
literacy you know the continuous thing
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
that people always want more of is
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
classroom management um the behaviors
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you yes represent Cornell I I
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
did have a question about on number five
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
the certific cert ah certification
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
renewal um
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's to get your renewal you shall have
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
passed a subject assessment test I just
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
was wondering who would make up that
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
subject assessment test that teachers
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
would have to to take um prior to being
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
and I I tell I'm sorry
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
um at the end number RSA yeah right at
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page RSA
 
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.950 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page RSA
189

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
189
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I and it just me I may be
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
out of touch for a while but I haven't
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
heard of Educators having to take a test
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
to get their recertification in a long
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
time orever um and who would make up
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
that test that's just it's hard enough
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
to get I think all the credits in the
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
different areas that you have to get
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
them in without making a teacher take a
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
test every three years well I
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
um So currently to obtain your initial
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
license in ele El Ed k6 Elementary K8
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood Ed Reading Writing
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and Reading Writing specialist a
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
candidate has to pass the foundations of
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
reading exam which Pearson produces um
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
and this is the exam we spoke about
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
earlier um that follows the
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um uh uh research so um
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly what's in the
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
proposal is that um while current
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
initial license Seekers have to pass
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
that test we have thousands of
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
individuals Statewide in positions who
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
predate that testing requirement which
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
the State Board put in place about 2015
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
I believe so prior to that Educators did
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
not need to take that test as part of
 
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.109 align:start position:0%
not need to take that test as part of
initial

00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
lure so what we have is a significantly
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
large Workforce currently in the field
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
which has never taken that test and
 
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.270 align:start position:0%
which has never taken that test and
therefore

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
um you know may not have received
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
training the most upto-date training in
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
this area so I as I understand in in my
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
read of this it is that um in order to
 
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.390 align:start position:0%
read of this it is that um in order to
to

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh renew a license an educator would
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
have to show proof of passing this exam
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
um you know once not every three years
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
because we don't you know when when
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
folks apply for a license um they apply
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
for an elementary Ed k6 license and they
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
pass their tests if they then later
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
apply for another endorsement on that
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
license we don't make them retake the
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
test that I I don't think it's clear
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not every 3 years that they
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
have to take the test and it doesn't
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
state that there will be training for
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
those people to to make sure that they
 
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
pass it and it also said sh have passed
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
a subject assessment test so it's not
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
really clear what test yeah I um yeah
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
the intent yeah the intent was um what
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Al described um and I did not want
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
to specify uh a specific U name of a
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
test like the foundations of reading in
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
there so I just use the subject
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
assessment test um language um but shall
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
have passed an assessment test um uh to
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
my way of thinking you know says once it
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know doesn't require it
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
recertify Our advice is always that we
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
not put specific names whether they be
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
tests or testing companies into statute
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
or even administrative rule if possible
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
because things change and then all of a
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
sudden we're out of sync with um so
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of vagueness
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes an administrative rule as well
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
around um a test U because again if we
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
we say an exact name and then the
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
company changes that name now we have a
 
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.470 align:start position:0%
company changes that name now we have a
problem

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah so thanks Mr chair and
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and representative Cornell's question
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
I think is very um important one
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
certainly um there are you know teachers
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
who have been um um uh teaching for
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
quite some time there's new teachers
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
entering the um uh the field right now
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and I I I I think I'll probably wait
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
and ask this question for to maybe um I
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
I see Deb house um uh back there I know
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
professional development is something
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's very important to her and and um
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
and to to to to all teachers and you
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
know you know people people around this
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
table I was on hotman school board for
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
12 years so I certainly you know
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the number of PD days and
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
inservice days that U that that we have
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
and and and um and I think several of
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
them every year are very well organized
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
through our teacher organizations um and
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I'd be interested in in maybe
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
learning a little bit more about about
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know the the sort of continuing
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
education training programs but um but
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
rather than belaboring that I I just
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
wanted I wanted to get back to the the
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
437 and there's a lot there's a lot
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
packed into this and and um and you know
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
just sort of going through the sections
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
breaking them out um individually
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a section on assessment on
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
instruction on reporting on curriculum
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
and instructional
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
mandates on dyslexia screening and then
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
on certificate
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
renewal and um I I think they're all
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
loose I think they're all related to um
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh to what representative cordelli uh is
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
proposing here but um but I'm I'm trying
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
to uh sort of understand what might give
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
us the the the the strongest impact to
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
um to improve literacy
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know um you know for our kids um Le
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
and leverage the um the instructional PR
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
the professional instructional practices
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
that we have you know in our schools uh
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
today that get the best out of the
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
continuing education that all school
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
districts um you know perform uh without
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
having uh a certain one size fits-all
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
thing jammed down their throats and um
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I have received some some email from
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh from parents um who really um you
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
know appreciate the attention on on
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
early dyslexia screening um and and it
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like from from Kate McCaffrey
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
that um that that we're doing um
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
assessment right now and that this
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
would add
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
a mid or end you know a third a third
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
assessment so I don't know if if
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
currently we've got a reading assessment
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
um in statute because it says here in
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
section one that it's a new section um
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so what what what do we need from
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
this bill and and and to to Leverage The
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
Best of what we we have in place now I
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
can speak to the three times a year so
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
typically you want to assess at the
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year to gauge where the
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
students are a Midway through the year
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
to see that your supplement or whatever
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
you've done for RTI or mtss are working
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
and then an end of the year and the end
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
of the year is really powerful because
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
when the kids come back in the summer
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's very telling um where they lose
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
ground the summer um where where have
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
they come back in where did they leave
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
so typically you want to do three times
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
a year to really get quality assessment
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
and data speaks for itself data is
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to help the teachers guide the
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
instruction right so teachers need to
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
understand the data and they need to be
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
able to understand the different
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
assessment tools that are available and
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to use the tools in their
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
toolbox to help the children in front of
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
them so it really sheds light on the KN
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
and that's really typically why we do
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
three um in best
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
practices so is that and and this is a
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
work session so I'm yeah I apologize for
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
it getting a little loose so is that
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
what is spelled
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
out what what you just talked about is
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
that what's in Roman 1 and Roman 2 yes
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
in the fir in the first part of this
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
bill correct understanding that it would
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
be three times versus the other dyslexia
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
legislation which is only done two times
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
um and then the difference between this
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
one is there's no secondary assessment
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
so in the current dyslexia legislation
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
there is an assessment and then there's
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
a secondary assessment to triangulate
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
the data so that's just a little bit of
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two all so if
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
we can if we can hop down
 
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.789 align:start position:0%
we can if we can hop down
to

00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the um it's the third page but it's
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
on the inside not on the back um where
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
we've got section four screening and
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
intervention for
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
dyslexia is that building upon what's
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
being done right now
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
to yes so the idea is to screen students
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the screener will indicate a flag of
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
risk then the the teachers will create
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
an intervention plan which was what the
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
current legislation had um which is
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much mtss or RTI okay and and
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
make a plan for their for the students
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
according to the data okay and that's
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay um so that those are the
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
two those are the parts that of this
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
bill that I think are in the
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
assessment category and and those it
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
sound like make sense to to to you as as
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
improvements yeah
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
yes yes I mean three times a year we'll
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
get that that idea um yes I think
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
changing the language from a a
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
standardized assessment to screeners is
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
um level of assessment and engagement in
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
the class and it gives a little more
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the teachers to use what
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
they're using in the classroom um for
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of what they're doing now um
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
so and so so is that what this is doing
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
it changes it from assessment to
 
00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
screeners well the other the other law
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
said that it had to be an
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh screener for dyslexia
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah which means it had to be valid and
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
reliable and has data that it would show
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
um nationally a risk right so if you're
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
talking about a valid and reliable
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
screener it's gone through a peerreview
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
process um it's gone through multiple
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
rounds of data collection to become a
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
valid dyslexia screener um an assessment
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a screener are different so a
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
reading assessment can be an informal
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
assessment it could be another tool in
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
the toolbox um a ctop is technically an
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
assessment um but it can get into other
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
areas so there's the two tweaks on those
 
00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.789 align:start position:0%
areas so there's the two tweaks on those
different

00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
terms so can can I just keep keep sort
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
of pounding on this a little bit so in
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
section four where we talk about the
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
screening and intervention for dyslexia
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that improving upon the existing law
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
law I think Arlene said we're not
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
experts at everything in the um in the
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the manual it really helps to
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
have number one is the same so number
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
one is the same because it says that all
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
students shall be screened including
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
English language Learners using an
 
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
approved now it says Universal reading
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
screener um instead of an evidence-based
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
reading screener so there's a difference
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
there um and to identify the potential
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
risks for dyslexia so that is the same
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
the second part um well it's not it's
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
not the same because you just said
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
evence it changes evidence-based to
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
approve Universal reading screener which
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
is the the U approved the the screener
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
that's approved by the Board of
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
Education and not not not selected by
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
the local school district as an
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um yeah so what would be
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
better to have a universal one or an
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based one an evidence-based
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
shows that there's reli ility and
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
validity to the findings um when you use
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
that type of a screener so would it be
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
better not to change RSA 200 colon 59
 
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
replacing evidence-based with universal
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
with approved
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
Universal depends on who's approving the
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
universal screener right right yeah the
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
the intent was that um it would match
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
page right and Roman one on the first
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
page is a new section as opposed to a
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
repeal and
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
replace which is what's in section
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
four and
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
so would it would it be fair then to the
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
be I mean should the screener in I'm
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm bouncing back between section
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
one and section four but but if if
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um if if if being
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
selected by a trained
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
professional who's following the law to
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
select an evidence-based screener would
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
that be better language in section one
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
and section 4 than than deferring to the
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
department to approve a universal
 
01:02:42.359 --> 01:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
department to approve a universal
screening

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
technology well am I allow I mean if the
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
doe is going to publish like these are
 
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.190 align:start position:0%
doe is going to publish like these are
evidence-based

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
screeners it it gives like a options for
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
the schools to use but still allows them
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
to do evidencebased which they would
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
select anyways but they have to then
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
turn in the results and each screener is
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
different so you want to compare apples
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
to apples versus apples and oranges
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
right each screener has its strength and
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
its weakness which were part of the
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
guidance documents that are dyslexic
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee this summer met and we went
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
through evidence-based screeners for the
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
other pending law and so each one has
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
its strength and weaknesses and I guess
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
from that point on it's really what it
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
we want the data to guide the
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
instruction right and we want to see how
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
to help the kids so we need to have
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
something if you're going to have the EV
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to report it should be
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples so so in in section one
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
Roman one it talks about how the
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall identify
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
and contract for a measur measurable
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Universal reading
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
screener um and so this isn't a list of
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
screeners this is a contract um enacted
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
through the department right the intent
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
was um um as uh was mentioned an apples
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
to Apple's um uh provision in this um
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
for several reasons we want to have a
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
common base between districts in terms
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
of um screening and deficiencies and
 
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.150 align:start position:0%
of um screening and deficiencies and
result

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh plus if we are going to give out um
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
or make available uh
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
grants um I think that they have to be
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh based on a common um set of criteria
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
and a a common um measure um if if the
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
grant um process is going to have any
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
validity well well I mean currently the
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
state provides adequate education grants
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
to school districts to um uh develop and
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
and provide instruction is determined by
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
the local school district um so I mean
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
it it's it's you know it's not it's not
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
uniform um it's not a uniform product in
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
in in every school district it's
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
reflective of the um of the school
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
boards and the U the administration and
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
the teachers and the interest of the
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
teachers and the parents and the kids in
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
um uh in these districts so then we
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
still provide adequate education grants
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
um without they are based on um
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
attendance right but but on this um
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're making this available um to
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
students um where they have reading
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and if we're going to use
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
that I think there has to be an Apples
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
to Apples um basis um and uh because
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're not doing this in budget year um
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
we've changed from um uh a formal Grant
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
based on those numbers to a competitive
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
um grant program um uh just because of
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
the funding issue so a competitive grant
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
program so that some districts would
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
receive a grant for um screening for
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and other districts wouldn't
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
receive a grant correct it's a
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
competitive process
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's not just for dyslexia it's
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
for literacy in general yeah right right
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
um you know so I
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
I you know I like what I'm hearing in
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
terms of you know screening three times
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh a year in in in in these Early
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades that makes a sense
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
adding a new section where we didn't
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
have a section
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
requiring there's no section requiring
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
screening at all right now right because
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
this is a new section two times a year
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
so we're not for dyslexia for d for
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
dyslexia but this this screens for
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
literacy three times a year dyslexia and
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
right right um
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
so so I I I I guess what I'm saying or
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I guess I'm saying is I think
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
what you're offering here has has
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's some very good pieces um
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
in here I think uh some of
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
in here I think uh some of
it

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
maybe goes too far by by requiring a
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
certain uh tool for
 
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.710 align:start position:0%
certain uh tool for
assessment

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
um as as opposed to allowing the
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
district to choose from different
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
screening tools that may provide
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
different uh you know they have you said
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
they have tradeoffs the different the
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
different screen I mean I'm not an
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
expert in this area yes it's on their
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire guidance um on the
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
department of of Ed's website where we
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
went and we reviewed it for 10 areas um
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
phic awareness phonics and coding and so
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's trade-offs with different
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
assessment tools so could could it be
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
and again apologies for being loose
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
could it be that that one or two
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
different screening tools might be
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
really appropriate for conquered but but
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
some other screening tools might be
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
really appropriate for
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
Newport I if I could answer um the ENT
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
was for the um three times a year with
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
the um contracted Universal screener but
 
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.349 align:start position:0%
the um contracted Universal screener but
not

01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
um saying you cannot use any other
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
screener in the meantime because I've
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
talked to reading Specialists who um do
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
assessing um with screeners much more
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
often than three times a year and if
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
they want to use a different screener
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
maybe for specific students to look at a
 
01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:54.390 align:start position:0%
maybe for specific students to look at a
specific

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
um deficiencies um that's well within
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
their um purview and um I I certainly
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't want uh to block any further
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
assessment along those lines Glen I
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
think that's really helpful thank you
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
for for for clarifying that I appreciate
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
that maybe maybe we want to put some
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
sort of language like that um in there
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
that that reaffirms the local school
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
district's ability to select screeners
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
to um you know to meet the you know
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
their you know their needs
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
screen so I think that helps out a lot
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
assessment one one more piece I wanted
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
to touch on with assessment we have uh
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
Dr Green here um because one other thing
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
we wanted to talk about was um the uh
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
and talking about screeners versus
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
assessment we've got the third grade
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
assessment for English language arts and
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
we wanted to talk about whether how that
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
is aligned and how that plays into this
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
as well I think that was something um
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
you brought up representative Miler last
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
time so you know we have Dr Green here
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
to uh to address that that component as
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
well okay well let's let so so so if I
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair um you know this is
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
this the this is the last work session
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
we're having in 437 um if you feel it
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to have another one I mean we
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
might you if we because I I won't
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
mention one more thing um um we have
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
been working with u Dr carold Tolman who
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the authors of the letters
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
program okay and happens to live here in
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we've been working
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
with her and we have another um meeting
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
with her on the 26th of this month okay
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
um for what we thought might be final
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
review of the legislation oh maybe so
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we should have a so we could do
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
another review after we have that
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
discussion I think that would be I think
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
that would be great so if if I might
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
suggest though so that we can get
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
through this this very meaty and very
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
technical uh bill that affects how all
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
of our kids um uh learn if if we could
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
go down um through through each of the
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
components assessment interventions
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
reporting instruction mandates um the
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
dyslexia screen was part of assessment
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then the uh the certification
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
certification renewal profession
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
development and training at the next
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
session yeah yeah but but go go through
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
Section by section and and you know sort
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
of efficiently be able to uh see what we
 
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
need to do with this so we'll schu
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
something forly November I think Rick's
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
here right now
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah great thank you uh first of all
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is uh such an important topic uh we
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
all we all want our kiddos to be able to
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
to read appropriately and I want to
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank Glenn for bringing this forward to
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
us I'm sitting I'm way I'm way out of my
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
comfort zone here U and I mean I'm
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
sitting here I'm trying to think about
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
well how did I learn how to
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
read and uh although my age my memory is
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
not as good as it used to be but I can
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
remember Mr Levine in my fourth grade
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
putting on my putting on my desk the
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
book backboard magic because he knew I
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't reading very much and he knew I
 
01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:35.310 align:start position:0%
wasn't reading very much and he knew I
liked

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
liked
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
basketball and so it was backboard magic
 
01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.149 align:start position:0%
basketball and so it was backboard magic
that

01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
basically made me a lifelong reader so I
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank him for that um and so the
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
question I guess I have we've heard the
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
term the science of
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
reading is that a gen so the question I
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
have is that a generic term or is that a
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
dicta uh for a reading uh so that's
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's one one question the other
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
question that I have is that on on uh it
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.950 align:start position:0%
question that I have is that on on uh it
would

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
would
be

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
section section
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
five um
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
3i uh Glenn you list the issue of of
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
pman awareness letters of knowledge
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
understanding alphabetic principles
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
morphology I've never heard that term
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
before semantics
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
syntax how do all those issues fit in
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
to learning of reading and and the
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
actual uh training of teachers in these
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
components so there there really are two
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions one is the science of reading
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
a dicta a particular philosophy of
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
reading or is it just a generic term and
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
then the second piece are these
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
component parts that you've listed here
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
does that cover everything or is that a
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
particular approach uh to reading
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
because I I don't understand how these
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
all I'm assuming they all fit together
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
some way but I don't know whether or not
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's a a program or or whatever so if
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
you could just clarify it from yeah so
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the science of reading is a methodology
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's a meth methology and looking at the
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
data but also looking at what has been
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
evidence-based for the Neuroscience in
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
reading so you can go back to the 80s
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
you can go back to the National panel
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
where they reviewed um literature for
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
what is an evidence-based program which
 
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
that means I can take this program and I
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
can move it to different schools and I
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
will get the the similar results it's
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
valid it's reliable it's been
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed and it has a clear
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
methodology so it isn't really a program
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
it is a method of understanding data and
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
understanding how children learn to read
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
and the areas that you mentioned are
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
considered evidence-based how we learn
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
to read we learn with semantics we learn
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
with phology we learn with our letter
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
and sounds and so there's a lot of
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
Neuroscience um going all the way back
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
to shally shaywitz back to um the
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
national panel and really looking at how
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
do we best teach children to read and so
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
that is the science of reading now
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
people call it different terms some
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
states call it evidence-based practices
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's really looking at what is working
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
in schools and what is working they have
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes 10 five five Decades of
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
research right so it's it's really
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
looking at research from different views
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
does it have evidence is it reliable and
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
valid thank you so how does that differ
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
from what's currently
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
being what's currently what being done
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
in schools it depends it depends it
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
depends I think what's different is that
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of people um when the national
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
reading panel came out there was an call
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
for um systematic explicit phic
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
instruction you know and phonic
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
instruction and I think um some teachers
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know they they wanted to go for more
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
of a balanced literacy approach where it
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't just the phonics that was
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
clearing there but oh we also want to do
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
all these things because we also want to
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
inspire students to read but I think
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
through that the balance became
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
unbalanced um and I think that's what's
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
happening is that there is a want to
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
inspire students to read but sometimes
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
the skills or knowledge to teach phonics
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
is really something you have to learn
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
and be comfortable with to be able to
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
teach the Next Generation so I think it
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
is happening maybe not um as balanced as
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
it should you know in the levels it
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
should be but I think that there has
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
been a lot of shift towards it and to be
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
honest some of the programs that schools
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
are using it is not um as evidence-based
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
or not all the components of it are
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
really uh aligned with the science of
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
reading so thank you for that
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
clarification so but wouldn't you also
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
agree that some
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
students learn differently in other
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
words some could use the whole language
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
approach for example Visa that of a
 
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.709 align:start position:0%
approach for example Visa that of a
phonetic

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
phonetic
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
approach so how does that the the
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
variance of how students learn how does
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
that fit into the quote
 
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.070 align:start position:0%
that fit into the quote
evidence-based

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
approach so they're really looking at
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
the neuroscience and understanding how
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh children learn to read so for
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
instance we know that the dyslexic
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
children are running on the frontal
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
cortex and if we give them an
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program we actually see
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
the other areas of the brain begin to
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
light up that we're at deficit so what
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
we know from fmri Imaging and from the
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
research being done with children who um
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
go under you know brain scans is that
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
when you give evidence-based instruction
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the orthographic processing area of
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
the brain begins to activate so that is
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
what the research says um in regards to
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
teaching phology it won't harm any child
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
if you teach phonics um for any child in
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
the classroom and you know I my students
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
when they ask me why I say when we teach
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
fimic awareness and fonics right through
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
the sound and decoding one sound
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
teaching them one phon name allows them
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
to learn and be able to say hundreds of
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
words if we do Whole language and we
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
teach one word they learn one
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:01.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
and how different areas of the brain
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
work together in terms of understanding
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
reading but it also talks about the
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
difference with
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
theia and it's a different process
 
01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
different way the brain works when
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
there's issues with
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah one five
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
so before
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
bills thank you thank
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:20:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
good morning apologize for the
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
appearance today in jeans and Apollo I
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
just got back from Colorado and spending
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of the day getting ready for a
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
conference and moving furniture at the
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
department so a little more casual
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
today I hope you had a good time in
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
Colorado it was good yeah
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so one of the questions was raised
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
last um subcommittee meeting was about
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
the third grade assessment and if we are
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
moving in the direction of the
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
evidence-based science of reading
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
research um based
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
instruction um how does that play with
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the third grade um assessment that is
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
being given to students for English
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
language arts um I think it it plays
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
really well um because does third grade
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
State assessments begin and really um
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
look at what students have learned by
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
the end of third grade it sort of you
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
know do students have the skills
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to move into that fourth grade
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
it's the first state assessment that
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're giving when we talking about the
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
science of reading and a lot of the um
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
literacy assessments that have been
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
talked about today that's uh assessments
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
and building skills for students in the
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
K first second third grade and measuring
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
students progress up to the point where
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
the state assessment would be given so
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to build all those
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
foundational skills that then
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
theoretically would transfer to student
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
performance on the state assessment um
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
the assessment itself isn't necessarily
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
built for a a k to2 level set of skills
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
and Frameworks um but I think everything
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
talked about with this bill builds the
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
skills necessary for students to be
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
assessment um so there would have to be
 
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
no changes made in terms of the
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
questions that that are being asked on
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
the assessment um with uh let's say the
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill no I don't think
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
we'd have to make any changes to the
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
current state assessment
 
01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for Dr Green
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much and U let you
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
go back to moving that furniture around
 
01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.070 align:start position:0%
go back to moving that furniture around
thank

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
you um anything else from the
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we have uh two minutes
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes good morning I'm Brenda Peters I'm
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the international
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
dyslexia Association Northern New
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
England Alliance representing Main New
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont um I do have some
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
comments about the um Institutes of
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
higher education and teacher preparation
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
programs um I am very concerned about
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
that because as a reading specialist in
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
a learning disability specialist I was
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
never required to teach a child to
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
read like let that sink
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
in as a master's degree in Reading as a
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
reading specialist and learning
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
disability specialist I never had to
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
teach a child to read and I didn't know
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
how I had to go outside of the school
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
systems the higher education system to
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
get the training in structured literacy
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
which the the pillars of um language are
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
based upon in order to teach a child to
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
read so I believe all teachers should
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
have the experience the knowledge and
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to teach children to read
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
especially those who are Specialists so
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
um there was a comment made that um
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
about balanced literacy and that
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
teachers want to teach balanced literacy
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to teach balanced
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
literacy they want to teach kids to read
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we won't be able to do that with
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
balanced literacy
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
um we need to be able to uh teach that
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
65% of our kids in the classroom are one
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
or more years below grade level in
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
reading so it's starting out with our
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation programs we need our
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
elementary Educators to be able to walk
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
into a classroom take all that great
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
background knowledge they have and apply
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
it and one hour of observation of them
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
teaching a reading lesson is not
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient these teachers need to have
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
practice and experience and I keep going
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
back to Driver's Zed imagine taking
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
driver ed and doing just the classroom
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
portion but never driving the car that's
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our education system
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
these teachers need to be in and working
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
oneon-one with a student to see how does
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
phic awareness work how does Phonics
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
work how do I pull together semantics
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
and syntax and comprehension all into a
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
lesson I know how to do that I learned
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
it outside of the school system it helps
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
me pull together all that background
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge I got and apply it we need to
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
be specialists in applic application and
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
implementation and right now we have a
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
huge disconnect and I went to a private
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
school so I didn't go to a state school
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
but I have trained many many of our
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
teachers that came out of the state
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
schools even as reading Specialists who
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
did not know how to teach a child to
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
read including those who who struggle so
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes three onethird of the population
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
will learn no matter what we despite
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
what we give them but the other
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds need to have this direct
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
systematic approach to
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
instruction thank
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
you any questions for uh Miss
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
Peters see n thank you very much for
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
being here and um with that uh I guess
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
we'll end today's subcommittee meeting
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
and we'll schedule one for the uh
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of November um allowing us to
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully get something drafted for
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
our final uh meeting on November 13th um
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
which will be when the uh full committee

will um vote on this
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislation so um
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
you you can come back a few more times

if you'd
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:32:07.709 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
the next set of bills which we have
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
docket okay uh um we're going to be
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
jumping around with these bills a little
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
bit here uh the first bill which I'd
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
like to take up this morning and these
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
are all six retained bills uh for the
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole uh the first bill
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to address uh as uh uh Mr
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
applebe has to be out of here and he has
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh he has uh information for us on
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
hp55 and that as we discussed this uh at
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
the previous meeting meeting which we
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
had on these bills uh back on October
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
5 um we had discussed uh the need to get
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
some clarification from uh Mr applebe
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
regarding um where we go with all the
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
two parts in this legislation this is a
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with the relative to the
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
division of educator support and higher
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
education and relative to shy
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
indemnification for private
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
postsecondary career schools um the
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill dealt with the
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
makeup um of the higher uh education
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
commission and the second part dealt
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
with theity uh Steve I think we were
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with the latter part with the
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
sh can you deification can you please uh
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
explain to us uh why that is or isn't or
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
can be developed later or what have
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh chair lad uh Steve
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
applebe director of educator support and
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
higher education at the department of
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
um at this time I would
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
recommend not moving forward with the
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
shy indemnification piece um I have some
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
calls out to some Career School owners
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
who are interested in this change
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
however uh due to scheduling and timing
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
getting them here is is they run
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
businesses so and schools so it's not
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
always easy to get them here so I would
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
recommend um we put this off till the
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
next session next year and we just look
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the makeup of the higher red
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
commission which is really much more of
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
a practical issue when we hold higher
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
red uh commission meetings as I
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think um back on October 5th
 
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
there was another bill that also had
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
this higher red commission piece in it
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the some of the areas that we
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
run into problems on the commission is
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't have the opportunity for
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
designes for several of the positions
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
like the chancellors um we have a seat
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
that we've had for years for a
 
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
for-profit college representative we no
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
longer have any for-profit colleges in
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
our state um they're all gone so um that
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
seat perpetually sits open and um based
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
on the national landscape right now in
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
higher red we don't anticipate there
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
being a for-profit college in our state
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
anytime in the near future and we can
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
always come back and ask that it be re
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
added back um so that's that's really
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
this is you know the commission is more
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
of a a housekeeping measure to to um uh
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
clean up some past you know relics of
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the past so to speak and what we have
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
today may be relics in the future seeing
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
that I think the community college
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
system meets tomorrow we do yes and the
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
university system meets tomorrow correct
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
and looking at uh structuring the
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
systemwide governance so so we may come
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
back again with another we may come back
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
but okay are there further questions
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
here for from the the group uh uh
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
regarding this this
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
Bill yes represent sure so just to just
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
to review the bidding here uh it would
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
be to to
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
bill where's the where's the sh part
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's on page page two at the end on
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
line section two yeah so it would be
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
what your recommendation Mr Apple is to
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
drop section
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
two yes
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
and section
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
one is a you also recommended the
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
commission may in shall correct and that
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
was with regards to the grant question
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a record of the
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
commission ever pursuing a
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
grant as a commission um we we did we
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
look back I I started on the commission
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
I was on from 2007 to 2017 as a
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and so going back to 2007
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
the commission is not pursued a
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
grant uh we could research that further
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
back that would take staff time in some
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
hours but um changing that word from
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
shall which is
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
fairly RI rigid and um open-ended you
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
know what Grant what type of
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
Grant copy the bill in front of you I
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't here let me give you a copy right
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
here so I know you got to run and if
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's anything that you see within
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't it actually dropping the accept
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
for apply for accept and spend state
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:27.159 align:start position:0%
grants yeah why why don't you just go
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
right from page one down through the
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
membership there and we had some
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
discussion on all those items and just
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
tell us from your perspective as the
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
Director of higher ed where we should
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
go uh thank you okay so um part two
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
which is uh there's hereby established a
 
01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
higher education commission which
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
consist of the following members um the
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion is to add designes to the
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
chancellor of the community college
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
system um and you see now this bill
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
should also add design under number
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
three Chancellor of the University
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
system which I believe the other bill
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
has that language there are two bills
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
that are very similar um so we would
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
want we we were hoping to see a design
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
for number three for the chancellor of
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
usnh a design for number
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
four which is the chancell of ccsnh and
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
a design for number five which is the
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of UC
 
01:38:21.679 --> 01:38:23.229 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of UC
ation

01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
ation
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
um the next change
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
um was number seven and That Was the
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
removal of the for-profit
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
college as I mentioned there aren't any
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
for-profit colleges currently in our
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
state and have not been for seven
 
01:38:38.599 --> 01:38:43.790 align:start position:0%
state and have not been for seven
years

01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the next suggested change
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
will be at the top of page two line
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
will be at the top of page two line
one

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.070 align:start position:0%
one
one

01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
toate m still no we want to leave number
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um where is number four line eight goes
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
away line8 would go away right that
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
would be the the suggestion or change
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
that to May apply
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
because up up top we say shall which
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
then implies in number four we shall do
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah did you see what I'm saying
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
there so we either want to take out
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
line8 Al together or add the word May in
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
there somewhere so that we have the
 
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.669 align:start position:0%
there somewhere so that we have the
option

01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
M and then the rest up until and then we
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
would drop shy indemnification it's just
 
01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:47.790 align:start position:0%
would drop shy indemnification it's just
ruming

01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
ruming
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah are there any other areas and and
 
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
the in section two of course is then
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
taken out of the bill any other
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions of uh Mr applebe at this time
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
so Rick yeah yeah just um so I I know
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
when we had the when we had the hearing
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
I asked about this question um when it
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to state federal and other
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
grants and and you you said nothing's
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
nothing's happened for a long time on
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
that what possibly could the higher
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
education Commission do with state
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
grants I I don't have an answer
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative I I mean I
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
I so can I just provide maybe it's
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
entirely possible and I I could try and
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
do some research on this it is entirely
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
possible that this is hold over language
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
from when the Office of postsecondary
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
Education existed prior to 2011 in 2011
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
the office of postsecondary education
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
was folded into the Department of
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
Education but when it was a standalone
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
entity it also administered a number of
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
financial aid programs it had other
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
duties and the and the commission was
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
different back then they had a much
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
larger purview um they were much deeper
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
into program approval in our
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
institutions and um I know that office
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
applied for Grants at the time and so
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
that language may be hold over from that
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
time right
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
so so just just asking the question
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
though if if we if we struck line eight
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
which is the number four apply
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
except and the higher education for
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
commission for whatever reason down the
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
road wanted to apply for a grant not
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
having it in there wouldn't bar it from
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
doing that right no um and in fact what
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
I would say is the more likely they
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
would find a grant and they would
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
instruct my office to apply as
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department yeah because they don't have
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
staff there you go right so they would
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
instruct um my team to apply my team of
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
one and um and we would we would apply
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
for that Grant 1.5 1.5 okay okay thank
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome any other
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill I think we have
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
it nailed down so we can make an
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
amendment and go forward with what we've
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
heard today any doubts on that okay
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%

01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
okay looking at the docket assets
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%

01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
354 this is the bill that it dealt with
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
the charter schools receiving School
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
building Aid and I do have uh today uh
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%

01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
2308 and I have amending language here
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%

01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
CHR I can quickly tell you what I did
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
from what we had in the previous
 
01:43:25.159 --> 01:43:26.669 align:start position:0%
from what we had in the previous
Amendment

01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
um I have on lines 25 and 30 deleted
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
that section where if
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
um a charter school were to go through
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
the process of disillusion but they'
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
first have to have assurity bond up
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
front uh less
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
depreciation um what I've done is on 2A
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
above on line 21 and
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
22 any Charter Public School to be
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
improved or constructed using School
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
building age shall be owned by the
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School and in the event
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
of a voluntary or involuntary
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
dissolution shall be subject to the plan
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
for disposition of the Charter Public
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
Schools assets pursuant to
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
RSA as approved by the State Board of
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
Education and then if you look down at
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
part three on the bottom of that
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
page that was in the amendment the other
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
day it's just language which is in place
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
already for all public schools but
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools been added to it and
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this legislation so if
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
they have a a school that does uh
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
dissolve or due to an involuntary or
 
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary disolution um and they have
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
this in their um their their their
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
Charter or their plan for disposition
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
then if it's within the 20day 20e period
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
they have to pay back what the the the
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
public schools are having to pay back uh
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
that that's that process the business
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
about the shity bond because they're
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
receiving their funding in a different
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
pattern and way than the the school
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
districts where they get 80% upfront 20%
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
of the state allocation amount at the
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
beginning of the project this formula
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
for the charter schools is different
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's and you can see that's been laid
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
out um they get 30% % but that's uh a 5%
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
each year thereafter um uh over the
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
course of the 20 years so um it it it's
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
different uh and with that uh
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
understanding I I I I believe that this
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
does cover the the the uh the liability
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
that the state may have the other change
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um is really there's no other
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
change but there were two changes that
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
were put in this as a result of the
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
disillusion commission that myself and
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and represent fellows
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh participated in uh and that's on
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
the last page on page six these these
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
two sections under five were in uh where
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
you have five Z there and under six
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 9 that that's in the amendment
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
that we proposed back on the 5th of
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
October on
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
2308 so what this amendment does only
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
amends that language on the first page
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
or deletes that section on the first
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
page everything else Remains the
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
Same open for discussion represent
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
Whit thank you chairman glad just a
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
clarification if I may um on the first
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
page where you're talking about in line
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
33 about the repayment that may be waved
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh in line
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
35 by the Department of Education is is
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the same payment repayment you're
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
talking about on the last page uh in the
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
new uh bullet
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
print so basically the child of school
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
could be uh free and exempt from any
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
repayment is that is that am I reading
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
that ask any any public
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
school that has uh something happened
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
within that 20-year period right and
 
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
they Clos the school down or Burns or
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
emergency the commissioner has that
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
Authority already for the public schools
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
regular public schools to say you you
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't owe back to the state M that that
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
same language is applicable to the
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools same
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
language thank you and they would pay
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
back only that amount which they've
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
received which would be and so there's a
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
strung over a whole lot it's not like
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's all up front with the public school
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
which gets that 80 correct right the
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
this is Strung Out Over a period of
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
years but those one fault Mr chair yeah
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear those two pieces
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
those two uh section then would would
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
basically eliminate any requirement for
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
repayment based on the commissioner's
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
decision yes okay that's right thank you
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
forgiveness pardon me it would be
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
forgiveness yeah right as we have in law
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
right now yeah what's that that's in law
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
right now yeah yeah
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
so yeah Corell you had your hand up yeah
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you just
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the first page that's um alone
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness if there is some kind of um
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh disasterous situation at the school
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
whereas um the last page section five
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
really came up as a result of the
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
dissolution um commission that chairman
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
lad um uh discussed and in those
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
meetings we had um the department there
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
talking about dissolution as well well
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
as the division of charitable trusts
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Justice who are
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
heavily involved um because charter
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
schools are nonpublic and so have a um
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
reporting reporting requirement to the
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
charitable trust and the charitable
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
trust gets involved if there's any um
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
dissolution of a charter school through
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bankruptcy process so this really
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
this um section five um plays into to um
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
those meetings and those discussions
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice well and
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
just a little followup to What Glenn
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
just mentioned is that any other
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
assets which the the charter school May
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
owe on or there may be debt the state by
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
that sentence right there is not going
 
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
to be held liable for something that the
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
charter school has incurred uh this
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
language in this bill is trying to
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
address only the obligation to pay back
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
the school building aid but the the
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
study committee which uh had senators
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
and slash Representatives on it uh
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
agreed we didn't want to be held
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
accountable for any other assets that's
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
done through the other organizations
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
that uh uh Glenn has just spoken to but
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't want to have that debt
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
passed down to the to the
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
state yeah
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
so thanks thanks r i mean I I
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
um I'd certainly like to hear more from
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
the the director of the charitable trust
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
division with respect to how uh how the
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
the um liabilities incurred by a 501c3
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
would somehow acrew to the state I'm I'm
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
finding a little Preposterous but um but
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
but I think that that you've what you've
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
got here in section five has um has
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
really nothing to do with the the um the
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
um building aid program but with the the
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
charter charter school this the section
 
01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
of law that establishes Charter Schools
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
not above not not not for building aid
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
but my question really goes more to the
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
building Aid and um and you've certainly
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
got um voluntary and involuntary
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
dissolution in here in several SE
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
several places but but how many New
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Charters have um have
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
dissolved um so far
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
one yeah talking since the start since
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
the start
 
01:51:31.599 --> 01:51:34.709 align:start position:0%
the start
yeah

01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I and I guess to to to be
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
fair when when when considering that um
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
it would be also good to know how many
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
public school districts have dissolved
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
so far through voluntary or voluntary
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
dissolution and Stranded assets well I
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
doubt if we have a whole lot of public
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
schools have done that we may have one
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
that went to a conversion school right
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
right um but you've got you've got
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
you've got I mean those are taxpayer
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
owned as opposed to 501 exactly so you
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
see what this does it says that this has
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
to be written into that plan for
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
disposition of the charter school that's
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
not in law right now and what we're
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
doing here is on page two one lines 20
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
through 24 saying your plan uh when you
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
put these Charter Schools together the
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
agreements the charters shall have a
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
plan for disposition of the charter of
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
public schools assets uh so they're not
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to get building Aid unless there
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
place but it's it's not saying in 2A
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
include restoring you know making the
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
state whole um it just says that the
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be subject to the plan for
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
disposition it it doesn't say that it
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
has to be in bolon
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
3 and you know and and you know while
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking up at the number of
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
Charters that that have gone through
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
through through dissolution processes it
 
01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:24.679 align:start position:0%
probably good to know how many did so on
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
a voluntary basis and how many did so
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
through bankruptcy which is well you
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
know through through involuntary process
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
well both can be bankruptcies but um in
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
in in both cases both voluntary and
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
involuntary were any assets um uh
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
recovered that were distributed to um to
 
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
creditors and where would the state be
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
in If This Were to to be would the would
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state be subordinate to other
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
creditors or would the state be have
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a you know perfected uh interest in
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
in all assets not just the building
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
assets you put something
 
01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
in well we we of course when we had the
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee study would the dissolution
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
people with and working with chable
 
01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
trust and the
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
director the the is isue that came up
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
with is that the way to deal with that
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
and do it quickly was to you we they
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
aware we had this other Bill dealing
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
with school building aid for charter
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
schools which also within that there is
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
reference to that in the as far as if
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh dissolved or the dissolutional
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
for for I guess Expediting that process
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's why it was attached into this
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
right here so that it could be really
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
clarified that really has you know are
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
you talking about other assets beyond
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
what has come in as the state has
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
contributed for building
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
Aid sure I mean you know every you know
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
an organization um can have I mean
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
building land and building are are the
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
are primary assets of of a lot of
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
organizations and um and you know
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be other asset there
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
could be other assets too like um like
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know money in a bank account uh
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
something like that so so I guess the
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
the question would be if if a if a
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
charter with such assets was going
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
through voluntary or involuntary
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
dissolution why would be the first
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
question and what would happen to to
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
those assets and um and in most cases
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
particularly if if they had taken out a
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
um uh a mortgage let's say um to uh to
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
to construct a facility the um the uh
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
and I may be getting is the mortgage
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
holder the bank yeah the mortgage holder
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
would be listed as the as the number one
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
creditor and they would be made whole
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
before any other creditors would be made
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
whole and other creditors could could be
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know I mean could be Staples could
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
and yeah but the number one in the
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
pecking order is going to be the
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
bank well what we're trying to say is
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to come down where
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
all the the revenue or all those assets
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
are used up and they're still debt and
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't want to be held liable
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
for any of that the state doesn't want
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
to be holding the back that's right and
 
01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.109 align:start position:0%
to be holding the back that's right and
and

01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
and for the most part and again this
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
beyond my my
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
expertise but
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
but the the first creditor the primary
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
creditor with the perfected security
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
interest in the in in in in the assets
 
01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
um may not even be made whole in a in a
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
in a bankruptcy and so you don't even
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
get to number
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
two you don't even get to wdb Mason and
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
Staples and Best Buy and Amazon and and
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
credit cards and
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
all these other things
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've been through that with the
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
Water Commission where I was a
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner and there was a lot owed to
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
the Water Commission for bills that had
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
not been paid and for piping and all
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
that we are way down the list we never
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
got reimbursed for that we had to eat it
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
we had to write it off um that that was
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
that was for a a private business who
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
was a was for a private business
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
business that had a trailer park right
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
that owned all the trailers but you know
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
and uh some of the renters were not
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
paying the bills Etc so it just slops
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
down and we as a water district got
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
caught with that and so but on this
 
01:58:07.950 --> 01:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
particular situation here this is an ear
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
area we work with a charitable
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
trust and it does not necessarily have
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
to be in this bill if we see that this
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
language needs further work somehow I'm
 
01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
good with that because has nothing to do
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
with you know the other partions already
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
taken care of on the front page in terms
 
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
of the state monies for uh building Aid
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm I guess what I'm
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
asking Rick is why would we be
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
considering putting the state in a in a
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
subordinate position to other um to
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
other debt in order to provide building
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
Aid essentially invest in the
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
construction of a charter school when
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
we've got a 250 million backlog of
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
public schools looking for for building
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
Aid that we haven't been able to to to
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
to address in the last decade and um
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
what why would we why would the state be
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
be taking a you know a put you know
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
putting its assets at risk when we know
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
when we invest in the construction of of
 
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
public schools the um uh the assets are
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
dissolution I me just I don't understand
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
why I I don't think we necessarily are
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
um per the charitable trusts as I recall
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh chairman um they are involved the
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is involved in any
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
um any such case um and each of those
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Charter Schools um requires is
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
required to file paperwork um with the
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and that includes a
 
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.310 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and that includes a
more

01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um dissolution agreement
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
than is in the charter school
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
application Charter School applications
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
are required to have a dissolution
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
agreement um as well but um
 
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
they're um the uh director there
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
requ that's sent to the charitable TR
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
sure sure no I understand all that but
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
but I I guess it would be good to hear
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
what what is required by Statute to be
 
02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
in the dissolution agreement and and to
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
what extent does the Department of
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
Justice charitable trust division uh get
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
involved in during a um during a during
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
a dissolution um uh case you know my
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
understanding is charitable trust gets
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
involved when when you see um nonprofit
 
02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
mergers among hospitals um because
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's obviously lots of assets
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
involved here it's not a dissolution
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
situation but but often times and maybe
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
more often than not a dissolution is a
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
result of of um of um uh inability to to
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
you know um you know for an organization
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
to meet its obligations and um and you
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
know the the the charitable trust
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
division isn't going to be in a position
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
where it needs to establish a charitable
 
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
ER trust um as a result of a zero asset
 
02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
you know dissolution or a dissolution
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
where where there's already a um a prime
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know a bank is holding the lean on
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
an asset that doesn't even cover the
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
what the you know what the leans for so
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
I you know what what what's what's
 
02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
actually required I guess is see the
 
02:01:42.669 --> 02:01:42.679 align:start position:0%
only part in law right now is what you
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
see already there in Z what on
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
Z on on page five six of this uh
 
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
amending language you can see what's in
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
law already on line 11 Charter Public
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
Schools establishment Provisions for
 
02:01:58.750 --> 02:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
dissolution of Charter of public schools
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
including disposition of assets or
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
amendment of its program plan that's all
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
it says that's all it says that's law
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
right now yeah so so it it it it doesn't
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
say that that the state is always in the
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
primary position for for asset recovery
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
or or or anything like that
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's also um law regarding um
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the charitable
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
trusts um that um you know we didn't
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate into here but they are
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
actively involved in any
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution um of a charter school and T
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
can relate how many but um uh they are
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
actively involved in that and uh but
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
they had several people at the meetings
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
we had um that are involved in in just
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
that area of expertise so to try to
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
expedite things here tell we'll get your
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
report in a second here
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
um it looks if if this is a hangup on
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and which has basically it
 
02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be in this bill this is
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
a request of that committee which meant
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
to try and get it addressed if we feel
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's not addressed properly it's
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
actually something probably shouldn't
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
come to this particular committee if you
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
talk about the charitable trusts and the
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
assets of you know of a a charter that's
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce that's right and and so but the
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
other portions that we address uh
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
address on page one is this seeing that
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school building Aid
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the reimbursement of what they've
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
already received on the school building
 
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
a it may be if we're you
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
know you know seeing that there's maybe
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
more to this story than than you know or
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
more issues the I know we had the
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice we also had a
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
chable trust testifying in that
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee and I know that representative
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
fellows put through their Hoops pretty
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
well uh good and so but you know I think
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
that if if there's if that portion right
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
there is going to hang this up it really
 
02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.270 align:start position:0%
there is going to hang this up it really
is

02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
not it's it's there because we had that
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
one section in law item Z there
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions that we just read that's
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
there and it talks about
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
disillusion and disposition of assets um
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
so that it was thought well maybe this
 
02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
is a good place because that's under
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
Charter of schools that in this whole
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
section we're dealing with yeah so so so
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
Rick I do I do think in order for the
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill to work the bill on um on building
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
Aid to charters for it to
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
work that that members would want to
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
know what the state's risk is is going
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
to be because we don't have any risk
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
with with public school dissolution
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
there is risk with Charter School
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
dissolution and what is that risk to the
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
to the state and um um you and
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the fact that
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
we've got a $250 million backlog of of
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
projects that we haven't been able to
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
you know you know address for a decade
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so if you're trying to to to address
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
that part in section five on the back on
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
the back page I'd say this doesn't
 
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
answer the question about risk to the
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
state and um and without language that
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
um that either requires aity Bond U to
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
be in place to cover it or you know
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
something on a on a tapered basis over
 
02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
the over the years or or something um
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
that that puts the state in the um in
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
the primary in in the top spot as a as
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
the number one and I think the term is
 
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
perfected security interest in the
 
02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:55.719 align:start position:0%
assets represent Luna there were three
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations came out of that
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee yeah two of them are
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this legislation right
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
here and uh line 18 is also a
 
02:06:06.669 --> 02:06:06.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation from them when a charter
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
school closes what happens to Student
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
Records um do they go back to the
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
resident District did they go to the
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
state how this is handled um and that
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
has been a problem in the past this
 
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as written I think cleans
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
that up so see there there's several
 
02:06:25.629 --> 02:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
areas which we're trying to address in a
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
an expeditious way uh dealing with when
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
a charter school closes uh it's a little
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
bit off school building Aid uh and um it
 
02:06:35.599 --> 02:06:37.030 align:start position:0%
bit off school building Aid uh and um it
would

02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh however I I I
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
I if we're uncomfortable with either of
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
those sections in this this bill we
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to have them there so so
 
02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
Ricki Mr chair that's not what I'm
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
saying I'm saying I'm saying this bill
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
is missing a section that that takes the
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
risk off the state in the event of of
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution um I have I would have no
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
problem um striking sections 1 through
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
four and um and just just going with
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
section five and six um in here you know
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
based on the recommendations of the um
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
dissolution uh committee that the
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
state's not held liable um to others
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
debts it's not that the
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
state this it's not saying that the
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
state gets paid back you know made whole
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
for building Grant this saying that the
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
state would not be held liable for any
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
outstanding WB Mason debt or something
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
like that that the charter has in the
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
event of dissolution uh I don't think
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
you have to say it but by saying it I
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we lose anything and and and
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
I think um uh uh section six with
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
respect to Student Records is probably a
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
good a good section so I have no problem
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
replacing the bill with uh with five and
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
six but but until there's until there's
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
something that that that makes it clear
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the state doesn't end up holding
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bag on on a um uh School building
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
aid grant that went to a charter school
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
and we've got $250 million backlog of of
 
02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
Grants to Public Schools I I can't see
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
expanding the program well th this this
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
bill addresses that issue of payback to
 
02:08:23.119 --> 02:08:23.790 align:start position:0%
bill addresses that issue of payback to
the

02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
state on what they receive on the State
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
Building Aid portion but but it doesn't
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
mandate anything B in 194 Bon 3 it just
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
says pursuant to to a dissolution uh
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
agreement um per 194 B col 3 it's it's
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
not saying the state has to get paid
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
back and again going back to dissolution
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
generally when you're in a involuntary
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary dissolution the uh the only
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
assets left are the um you know the
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
building and grounds and um and you know
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
and there may very well be a bank um you
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
know in there as the first um listed
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
creditor so I I don't see how the state
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
gets a dime
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
back to be I mean I'm just ask how does
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
the state even get a dime
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.830 align:start position:0%
the state even get a dime
back

02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr chair and I I tend to
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
agree perhaps this issue would be better
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
resolved in Commerce but if we are going
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
to talk about it we are um I think we
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
need to examine the full reality of what
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
would likely occur if we specified
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
specifically that the state had a had
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
pracy in any sort of dissolution for
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%
recovering funds the fact is if we were
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
to put that in the law it's highly
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
likely that l private lenders would then
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
view any lending to such such
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
institution as an unsecured loan which
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
would which would make them much less
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
likely eligible to receive private
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
lending in the first place so I think I
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at the the broad
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
issue here and say if we do this if we
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
were to do that we're probably telling
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
these charter schools public schools
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to make a choice
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
really do you want any Public Funding
 
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
here or do you want private funding so I
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
think that all of it comes back to the
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
to the fundamental policy issue do we
 
02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to fund public
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
Aid well T L's T T's been sitting there
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
while hi T bear with the charter school
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
office um so uh as of
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
200 uh six there have been eight charter
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
schools that have closed um just for
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
context of those eight um one was a
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
district approved Charter Pace Academy
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that was actually the only School of
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
those eight that owned a building that
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of um so just a little context
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
as of 2006 as of
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
200000 since 2006 excuse me since 2000
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry about that so that would this
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
would include the one
 
02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
that closed up atate Mall yes a couple
 
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.350 --> 02:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
Y okay we're basically now looking at
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
whether this bill is going to move
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward or not
 
02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
um and trying to look at some form of a
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
13th if in fact the latter two sections
 
02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
five and six were not part of this bill
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
is the remaining part of the the bill of
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
people yeah that I
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
mean five and six Rick are the only
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
Parts I don't have concern with I I have
 
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
concern with the with the remaining part
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill with five or six in there or
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
and or with five or six gone
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
um because because the there's no se no
 
02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
part of this bill that um that that
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
takes risk away from the state
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
dissolution further discussion represent
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
Bel I I would just like to take that
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
view and kind of flip it on its head for
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
a moment and say yes there obviously is
 
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
a risk to the state as they're all with
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
all public schools however we're getting
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
the benefit of private lending being
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
able to fund these schools and keeping
 
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of taxpayers down broadly so
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're risking if we
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
don't move forward with something like
 
02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.270 align:start position:0%
don't move forward with something like
this

02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:52.430 align:start position:0%
this
further

02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so uh is there any
 
02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
member of the public that has anything
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
all uh just real minor um I don't know
 
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
if the point is to go through an
 
02:13:11.069 --> 02:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
amendment approval but I just wanted to
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
point out One technical um issue and
 
02:13:22.549 --> 02:13:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
89 that bold I think should be struck
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
out that is referring to RSA 19815 U
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
through W that is for public school
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
districts um it's the that's the section
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
that calculates building Aid which goes
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
through formulas that's a whole section
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
that determines the amount of building
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
Aid somebody gets the following
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph strictly says simply says that
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools qualify for 30% so again
 
02:13:48.669 --> 02:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's just a technical
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
um correction but I would just not put
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
that bold in on line 89 Page
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
two because that 19815 U through W does
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
not apply to Charter
 
02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:12.830 align:start position:0%
not apply to Charter
Schools

02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes so thanks very much Mr chair
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
thanks very much a um how would um in in
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
the not the determination of the amount
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the grant but in the in the criteria
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
for awarding Grant how would um how
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
would uh how would the department be
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
looking at at at public schools and
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools and and make that
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
determination as to who gets a grant
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't there wouldn't be any
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
difference they all would follow the
 
02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
difference they all would follow the
same

02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
criteria and that criteria is uh there's
 
02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
a ranking criteria um the in this law
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's like unsafe conditions um security
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
consolidation overcrowding ADA
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
compliance things like that okay and so
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
the ranking would be it wouldn't have
 
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the type of
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
school yeah all the application process
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
is the same for the public school and
 
02:15:15.549 --> 02:15:15.559 align:start position:0%
the Charter Public School um same
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
criteria um same
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
law what this is basically saying is
 
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
that Charter Public Schools May apply
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
for a State Building Aid they are a
 
02:15:26.719 --> 02:15:29.310 align:start position:0%
for a State Building Aid they are a
public

02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
school um qu question uh for you Rick
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um when when when the when the
 
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
State Board approves a Charter Public
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
School and um it seems like most of the
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
charter schools are approved through the
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
State Board not conversion schools but
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
um but is there a facilities assessment
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
as part of that um approval process that
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
would be a a throwback to Amy at the
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
department okay um sure so that that
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
approval process we actually have a a a
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
new approval process but um so they get
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
their Charter through the state board
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
but then prior to student occupancy
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
there's an approval process for their
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
facility and it's the same actually for
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
public district schools for the most
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
part that Approval Pro there's a couple
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
minor differences but they still have to
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
have their emergency operation plan in
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
place they have to test their building
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
for asbest they have to test their
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water for lead they have to
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
have a health inspection a fire
 
02:16:26.549 --> 02:16:26.559 align:start position:0%
inspection they have to meet building
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
code fire code and the list goes on but
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
all of those facility requirements are
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
the same for public schools as public
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
chartered schools public district
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
schools and public chartered schools
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
okay and actually non-public schools as
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
well except that that that list is
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
paired down to what's actually
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
applicable to the nonpublic schools
 
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
which is a much more paired down
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
list okay great thank you very much and
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
we've had Public Schools regular public
 
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
schools theyve had to clean their act up
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
and and and and and conform to those
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
that criteria and those standards we
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
have for square footage for health
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
safety um and I don't want to mention
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the name but we had a school that went
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
ahead and did some of that and um had to
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
again so um where we are right now we we
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
got a number of bills on dock and here
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
we are already at uh almost
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
noon uh
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
so obviously we take a look I would like
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
to take a look further um and review my
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
notes that I don't have from the
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
charitable uh trust and and maybe invite
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust in uh to address
 
02:17:42.669 --> 02:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
that issue on the latter side
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
um it may come down to whether you
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
support basically the idea a of a
 
02:17:50.429 --> 02:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
charter school being eligible for State
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
Building A and if that's where you are
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
with your principles then obviously I
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
know where you're going uh but if you're
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
open to uh Charter Schools receiving
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
that type of of of funding
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
support then
 
02:18:09.309 --> 02:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
um we got to make that we got to enable
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
that to happen and that's what this
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
about so we'll we'll stop this right now
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
we will reschedule 354 for another
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
session uh probably one more session
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
we've certainly had a number of these
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
sessions so we'll reschedule this one to
 
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:34.509 --> 02:18:34.519 align:start position:0%
announced okay thank you very much tal
 
02:18:34.519 --> 02:18:41.190 align:start position:0%
announced okay thank you very much tal
and

02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
Amy okay the next bill which we had was
 
02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
439 taking from the order that they were
 
02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.389 align:start position:0%
439 taking from the order that they were
posted

02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
posted
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
439 is relative to the duty to provide
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
an education and contracts with private
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
schools um there were two sections to
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
this and um of this bill first part
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
dealt with 21 inclusive the second part
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
was a repeal of 189 col 1 - a Roman 4
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
relative to school board contracts with
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian private schools to provide
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
education is
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
repealed um represent cordellia can you
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
explain that to us
 
02:19:35.070 --> 02:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
please um I'm just try to find the bill
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
go uh yes um this was an area um of law
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
that was left out of our previous um
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
attempts to extend uh services to
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
special education students until their
 
02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
special education students until their
22nd

02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
22nd
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
birthday um so it was found um sorry it
 
02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
was found by uh someone pointed it out
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
to us and hence um this uh language just
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
to make it consistent with the other
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
language that we had put in statute uh a
 
02:20:21.790 --> 02:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
year or so
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
ago then this part the bottom part there
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
right here which
 
02:20:32.349 --> 02:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
references oh that law right there yes
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah this is um in relation to um
 
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
manifest education
 
02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
hardship um and that um that was also
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
left out um in terms of when we removed
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
non sectarian schools uh language from
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in in statute um so to be
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
consistent we wanted to do that here for
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the um uh manifest education hardship
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
this yes go ahead so on on
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
439 is it saying that um that that any
 
02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
in it should be the D School Board to
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
provide addition Elementary sector
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
education can remain in SEC let's just
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
say secondary education because I don't
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
think we're going get too many 21 year
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
olds at elementary but can remain in a
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
in a secondary school program program um
 
02:21:55.710 --> 02:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh until they turn 21 22 it's 20 all
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
right until they turn until they turn 22
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
correct yes so it's basically saying
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
saying if I wanted
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
to stay in
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
school and keep taking whatever classes
 
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
um meet graduation requirements for that
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
school I could continue to take those
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
classes until I turn 22 correct okay so
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
every school district would have an
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to every student not just
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
special education which is the
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
law well this
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
is right this is specific to speci
 
02:22:36.399 --> 02:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
is right this is specific to speci
education

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
students sorry
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah the first part the first Roman
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
numeral on on under that law deals with
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
and it said age 21 and it it wasn't age
 
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
21 inclusive and we've gone through that
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
battle many many many times so that
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
changes that the second part it jumps
 
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
through from 2 3 to 4 and it it
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates section
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
four and I had some questions as to why
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm bringing it up uh as to
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
why that is being repealed in this
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill that's a
 
02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
too why don't you read that section to
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
everybody so they can hear
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
it uh this is under Duty provide
 
02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
it uh this is under Duty provide
education

02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
1891 a uh Roman 4 pursuant to RSA 193
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
col 3 Roman 6 a school board May execute
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
a contract with an approved
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian private school approved by
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
the school board is a school tuition
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
program as defined in
 
02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
193 col 37 to provide for the education
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
of a child who resides in a district and
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
may raise appropriate money for the
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
purposes of the contract if the school
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
does not have a public school at the
 
02:23:59.469 --> 02:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
pupil's grade level and the school board
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
decides it is in the best interest of
 
02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.230 align:start position:0%
decides it is in the best interest of
the

02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
child so
 
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
this goes to the
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
um Town tuition programs they don't have
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
a um a grade level they can um
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
execute a
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
contract um with
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
a secretari and school as well as non-
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
sectarian school that be a religious
 
02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
sectarian school that be a religious
school

02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
correct by eliminating that Roman four
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
though are we eliminating the capability
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
it it's one of these areas of law that
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's I understand the intent which maybe
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
it was set for but are we also now
 
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
taking away that that legislation
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
enabling a district to contract with
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
some other District to take these
 
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
children because they don't have that
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
grade level within their ascending
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
receiving ascending District so are we
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
taking that capability away from the
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
district I I don't believe so I think
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is just um related um to that that
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
basically that one provision I'll look
 
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
statue yes represent gu Cen uh thank you
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused on that too cuz
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned manifest educational
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
hardship which is a process right to get
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to that um and was this line eight and
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
nine already in the current
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
statute or is it new to this bill that
 
02:25:42.990 --> 02:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
we're removing something I understand
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
the 21st up to 22nd yeah I mean that's
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
been we've been doing that pretty
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
consistently to apply um the way it
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
but if this is repealed does that take
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
some Authority away from the local board
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I just need more
 
02:26:03.269 --> 02:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
clarification on
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
it because a board would engage in a
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
contract no matter what kind of learning
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah see OPP confused to that it says in
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the part two of this legislation
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
relative to school board contracts with
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
non- secretari and private schools to
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
provide education is
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
repealed um so if you are a district and
 
02:26:29.269 --> 02:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
you have a child that's gone through the
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
best interest and all that you yet
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
manifest education and a hardship and
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's been approved by that local board
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
and they're looking now to try send this
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
child to another receiving
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
District can they do that if in fact
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're saying
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
um the that section law is
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
repeal why is it this I don't believe
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the current law I'm not
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
finding it under
 
02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
finding it under
189

02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
189
 
02:26:59.469 --> 02:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
1-A it goes up to a section three no
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's a section four or is there a
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
section four okay then I'm not on the
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
right we've got I've got it right here
 
02:27:05.279 --> 02:27:10.710 align:start position:0%
right we've got I've got it right here
okay

02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
yeah right so Rick
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes so looking at
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
you know this one of those things where
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
where I think we've got duplicative you
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
know a lot of duplicative language in
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
the law and and
 
02:27:29.439 --> 02:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
the law and and
189

02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
189
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
1A Roman 4 refers to 193 colum 3 Romans
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
6 and Romans
 
02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
6 reads if there's no public school for
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
the child's grade in the Resident
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
District the school board May contract
 
02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
so very similar language with another
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
Public School in another school district
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
or with any private school so not just a
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
non sectarian private school and offer
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
references Roman 7 what's that it does
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 and Roman
 
02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:06.389 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 and Roman
7

02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
to well because it puts the requirement
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
that it be a be a non-sectarian school
 
02:28:21.870 --> 02:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
school means the contract could be with
 
02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
the religious school and we have the
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
1933 where we made the change so that
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
they can contract with any private
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
school as was as was
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
read so this does not need to be in
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I think we need to just
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that we're not
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
undoing something that we don't want to
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
arms thank God for this annotative
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
version thank you it it basically says
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
that 1933 used to say
 
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
what the one we're trying to repeal now
 
02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
said right and so I think you can see
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they already did this in one place
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and still hanging over here in the other
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so therefore this is a it's another
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
area where we missed one section of
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
Statute because we made the change in
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
1933 to say any private school yeah and
 
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
that got signed into law but we missed
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
um this section in 189 didn't take it
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
out and didn't right okay further
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I think with you
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
know everybody should be looking at it
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and you know we'll you know is there
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
anybody that's objecting to this bill
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
right now then one um um yes
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not clear on that
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
piece so there we need more clarity then
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay we try and get that and make
 
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
it available when we're discussing this
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
on November
 
02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:47.309 align:start position:0%
on November
13th

02:30:47.309 --> 02:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
13th
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
or it when we come back to further
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
treatment before we could have it at the
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
same time need more clarity okay next
 
02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
one which we had in the order of of
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
where we are here uh just did
 
02:31:00.479 --> 02:31:04.030 align:start position:0%
where we are here uh just did
U

02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:06.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:06.359 --> 02:31:07.950 align:start position:0%
uh
SV

02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
SV
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
25 it's the next one I think on the list
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
out in the hallway didn't we
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
already uh yes um the decision on that
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
was there two
 
02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
um I I as I recall I think maybe we held
 
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
on to this in case not knowing what
 
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
would happen on the other
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
side right yeah so this one we don't we
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
don't need this bill it's
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
duplicative okay so we're done with the
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh 25 25 which one 25
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh 25 25 which one 25
yeah

02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
627 this is relative to local education
 
02:32:04.990 --> 02:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans and disparities in
 
02:32:07.870 --> 02:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
education that was represent lexus's
 
02:32:10.750 --> 02:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
Bill uh it was very complex I think it
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
was trying to redo 193
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
h and we know that we've had a long
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding this on the others
 
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
um what's the feeling of the committee
 
02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:26.230 align:start position:0%
um what's the feeling of the committee
on

02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you way back when in in uh
 
02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
we first heard that in in back in
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
February under section two on page page
 
02:32:40.349 --> 02:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
three the question of disparity was we
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be getting a definition do
 
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
we ever get to Define what persistent
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
disparity was
 
02:32:51.389 --> 02:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm on page page two hope line 21
 
02:32:59.550 --> 02:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
we'd ask for a definition of persistent
 
02:33:01.630 --> 02:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
disparity I didn't know if that came in
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
months I the the whole area we're trying
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
to model I here is that through one bill
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
we're tackling an awful
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
lot and it's it's overwhelming it's just
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
like 266 was right and and I don't think
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're at that point where we need to be
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
rewriting Improvement plans and the
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
assessment and Improvement
 
02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
assessment and Improvement
plan

02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh looking at section 193 C 193
 
02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:48.429 align:start position:0%
uh looking at section 193 C 193
h

02:33:48.429 --> 02:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of that has to do too with our
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
federal plan or application processa
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
Essa M Mike got feeling is on this one
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
right here it's um it's a step too far
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I yeah I agree
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
with that too and and during during the
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
hearing I think um representative leakas
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that much of the language
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
had taken from a bill that I had
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
sponsored a couple years ago um I
 
02:34:22.830 --> 02:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
thinkability section yeah I think this
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
language by itself doesn't hold um uh
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's really part of more
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive changes that consider
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
consider this accountability as part of
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
what's being funded um in education so I
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the chair so I I think
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
the recommendation ought to be itl in
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
this is there any objection nope okay go
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
um uh see uh no we did 155 147 HP 147
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill and the makeup of that Council
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
so we do have several amendments on that
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
we had an amendment by representative
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
Tanner we have a representative uh
 
02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:35.550 align:start position:0%
Tanner we have a representative uh
cordelli

02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment does everybody have a copy of
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
meeting um excuse excuse me chair yes um
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
I was I'm sorry I'm a little late uh
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
there were two amendments so uh Lyndon
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and I drafted yes
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if they've made it up
 
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
here yet um she was going to they there
 
02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
was a delay and putting them together
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
uhhuh do you have any so we don't have
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
that here right now so that that's still
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
an NOS you're saying I think so wow it's
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
taken them a long time
 
02:36:17.269 --> 02:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
could is that was that to replace uh
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
Linda's 147 Amendment or addition to is
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
it there yeah I I think it's it's a new
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
one that was directed by the committee
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh for us to put together at the last
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
session and basically what it did is it
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
removed one one member of the Senate
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um it was uh designed to uh allow
 
02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
people to serve dual roles as both the
 
02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
parent and a different like a a teacher
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
or a representative like that and it was
 
02:36:54.269 --> 02:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh the third part of it was to um add a
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
medical uh professional and but we
 
02:36:59.469 --> 02:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
prepared it twice two different ways one
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the medical professional and one
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
without um and since that time we've
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of different feedback uh so
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and I have been
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
looking at that Amendment again and in
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
particular looking at that dual rooll
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
piece because uh since our last meeting
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
we've gotten a lot of feedback from uh
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
different parent Representatives that
 
02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's not really what they're
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
interested in um the issue isn't really
 
02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
so much the Quorum it's more the
 
02:37:31.269 --> 02:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
majority itself um and they feel that by
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
um putting in a dual role it would um
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
kind of dilute the parent representative
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
role so in looking at the amendment that
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
is being drafted currently we've taken
 
02:37:43.469 --> 02:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
that piece
 
02:37:47.269 --> 02:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
out thank you
 
02:37:50.269 --> 02:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
further comments about this bill here
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent Damon
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and my apologies for being
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
late um I would like to speak in favor
 
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
of including the medical professional
 
02:38:02.910 --> 02:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a physician but a
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
licensed health care provider primary
 
02:38:08.269 --> 02:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
care provider um both because I
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
initially thought that that was valuable
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
but also I've had a lot of feedback from
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
um the population that they
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
would prefer that to be the case and see
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
it um chair excuse me I believe the uh
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
provider is there any objection to
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
putting a health care provider on that
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
Council I don't think there is the
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
feedback I have yeah gotten is
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
supportive of that as well
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay so when you're doing your Amendment
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that's in there that repres
 
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
U so it was it the direction of the
 
02:38:50.190 --> 02:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee then perhaps just put the one
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment with including the healthc
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
care provider and not do the one without
 
02:38:56.349 --> 02:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
the healthcare provider yeah now what
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
are the other two components that you've
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
added you know you took out one Senator
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
right or or or one one was it a senator
 
02:39:07.950 --> 02:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
yeah essentially that there's one
 
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
Senator out and and basically if we
 
02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
remove all the language about the Dual
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
role it reverts back to the original
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
language that would be in there and the
 
02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
only other addition was uh the election
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh chairperson uh Vice chair and
 
02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:24.190 align:start position:0%
of the uh chairperson uh Vice chair and
the

02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
clerk okay now represent Cordell you had
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%

02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
center it changes
 
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
two individuals with
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities who have received services
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:27.630 align:start position:0%
 
individual

02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and then further down with the
 
02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections it makes it um
 
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
one representative the from the
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections who is
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
education and then the um the addition
 
02:42:51.389 --> 02:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
of the clerk to be appointed and the
 
02:42:59.630 --> 02:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
discussed yes Co then represent Damon
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you BL can you clarify on why the
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
deletion of the the uh parent
 
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
information center or disability rights
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.429 --> 02:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
um I I think that
 
02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
um from my experience it's it's more
 
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.349 align:start position:0%
um from my experience it's it's more
important

02:43:26.349 --> 02:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:43:30.910 --> 02:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I should be in practice by now um
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's more important the focus of the
 
02:43:36.269 --> 02:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
federal law is a majority of
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
parents and that should be the focus um
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that the um
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
representatives of those two
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
organizations ations um are in the um
 
02:43:54.510 --> 02:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
Forefront of um what uh the uh
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
commission is tasked with doing um I
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
think the uh primary focus should be the
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the parents there um and teachers um
 
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
Etc who are directly in involved in in
 
02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:12.190 align:start position:0%
Etc who are directly in involved in in
special

02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
education um so I I don't think that
 
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
they are are um required in this Prov in
 
02:44:24.510 --> 02:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
this uh uh in this Council and they are
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
not um required under federal law either
 
02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
we Tred to stick more with what's
 
02:44:34.269 --> 02:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
required in under federal law um with
 
02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
these changes thank
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
you represent Damon did you have your
 
02:44:39.439 --> 02:44:40.630 align:start position:0%
you represent Damon did you have your
hand

02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
up I had the same question as
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and also wanted
 
02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
to know in the amendment from
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and balbon what
 
02:44:54.269 --> 02:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
you folks did with those two positions
 
02:44:57.550 --> 02:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
disability rights and parent
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
information um the uh amendment that we
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
put together kept those two positions
 
02:45:05.389 --> 02:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
in thank
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:45:10.830 --> 02:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
cascaden oops thank you Mr chair I'm
 
02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
um if if you know why DRC and pick were
 
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
included in the law
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
initially um they are the first
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
resources to provide to
 
02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:26.230 align:start position:0%
resources to provide to
parents

02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and really add Clarity sometimes to
 
02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:31.469 align:start position:0%
um and really add Clarity sometimes to
problem

02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
solve um some very serious
 
02:45:38.190 --> 02:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
issues so do you know why it was in
 
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
there initially was what was the role
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
and what was the function and why is
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
there no need for it
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't know um I I think uh they were
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
added um before my time so I'm not sure
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
um you know why they they were added but
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
I think that uh in terms of the parent
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
information center they do things um
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
other than uh special ed
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
education um so uh I think that that's
 
02:46:12.910 --> 02:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
one reason that uh um uh the other
 
02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative and I um I felt it was
 
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to remove it and from our
 
02:46:20.190 --> 02:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
experience I I was a member for several
 
02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
terms um and representative katab is uh
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
SAC yes representa
 
02:46:34.349 --> 02:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
dry thank you uh representative cordelli
 
02:46:36.269 --> 02:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
how many people would be on the
 
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee if you adopted your
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment um uh I think it was something
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
like 24
 
02:46:48.429 --> 02:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a lot higher number just
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
going this counted it
 
02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
yeah only now I can't remember it
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
counted it with disability rights and
 
02:46:58.590 --> 02:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
parent info center it comes out to the
 
02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
16 parents and 19 other people yeah so I
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
think I have that right so without it
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
would be 17 to 16 so it's still either
 
02:47:11.309 --> 02:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
way it's not a parent majority right all
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
followup please yeah so the idea I
 
02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
thought of this bill was to make this
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee function and it's not
 
02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
functioning at the large size that it's
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
at so we're just rearranging the deck
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
chairs on the Titanic here that that was
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
the original purpose of the bill um was
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
to shrink it and keep apparent majority
 
02:47:42.190 --> 02:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
um because of the
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
dysfunction um that uh uh
 
02:47:50.590 --> 02:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
parents um and legislators um have
 
02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
viewed over a period of
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
time and I think any any committee or
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
commission with 36 38
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
commers um even trying to get a quorum
 
02:48:10.110 --> 02:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
um whether it's online in person um and
 
02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
trying to respect the opinions and get
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
um feedback at meetings from 38 people
 
02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
is uh quite an obstacle to having an
 
02:48:24.429 --> 02:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
efficient meeting uh especially you know
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get a meeting done even within
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
two hours um is a chore and uh um that's
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
why um uh truthfully when representative
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
katab said she was interested I I said
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
place represent
 
02:48:48.510 --> 02:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
Bon um I just want to refer back to a
 
02:48:49.950 --> 02:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
lot of the feedback that I've gotten
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
from a lot of the parent Representatives
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are on the committee uh they feel
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
that the committee has really not is not
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
effectively representing the concerns of
 
02:49:01.710 --> 02:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
the parents and I believe what they're
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve with this is to make
 
02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
sure that it goes back to a parent
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
majority and that the focus is on the
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
parents concerns now I can't speak to
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
how that dysfunction arose and I've
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
heard differing um opinions about what's
 
02:49:18.269 --> 02:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
going on but it seems clear to me that
 
02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're not getting the
 
02:49:22.750 --> 02:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate data that they need to make
 
02:49:26.510 --> 02:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
informed decisions and um that perhaps
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're not getting uh the support that
 
02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
they need from the Department of
 
02:49:32.349 --> 02:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
Education so one of the things that uh
 
02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and I were also
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
looking into was making sure that they
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
had funds that were available to help
 
02:49:41.790 --> 02:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
with workshops and to bring in speakers
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
and and resources that they can use to
 
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
help get the information that they need
 
02:49:48.670 --> 02:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
to make those
 
02:49:51.790 --> 02:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
decisions uh just just uh one comment
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
here um a number of our committees when
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
we put them together we have technical
 
02:49:59.550 --> 02:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
support placed on these committees as
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
nonvoting members other words they're
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
there to provide assistance and
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
support um oftentimes like for example
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
in CTE advisory counil we have Jeff
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
there to provide us the guidance in fact
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
Jeff even shares it um then we had just
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
a a a a group dealing with teacher
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
shortage and we had Steve Apple be there
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
to give us technical support throughout
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
um so if if the primary purpose for some
 
02:50:28.590 --> 02:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the organizations to be there is to
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
provide support to parents they don't
 
02:50:32.830 --> 02:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a voting member
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
they can be there and contribute and be
 
02:50:37.790 --> 02:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
very active participants so that's
 
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
something we might want to consider as
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
well go ahead represent cordelli thank
 
02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
you um I think I think that's one reason
 
02:50:49.389 --> 02:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
um that we had uh added the appointment
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
of a clerk um I I think my experience um
 
02:50:56.429 --> 02:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
the council went way overboard in
 
02:50:59.950 --> 02:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
looking for um staff from the Department
 
02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
of Education um to provide services for
 
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
them I I went to the commissioner on a
 
02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
number of occasions about that myself
 
02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
because it was not um called for in
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
Statute in any way shape or form and to
 
02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
have um of special education or somebody
 
02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:19.479 align:start position:0%
else um uh along those lines taking
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
minutes for them I think was uh way out
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
of bounds and so that they should
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
appoint their own clerk to do their own
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
minutes representative cascaden and
 
02:51:32.229 --> 02:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell um I think it
 
02:51:35.830 --> 02:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
would make sense for me then to amend
 
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
um line 27 2829 the the DRC and Pi pic
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
to be members of this committee in a
 
02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
nonvoting capacity or advisory but they
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
should be included
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
somehow um but really the final decision
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the information that they glean would
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
be with the
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
parents yeah we've often times just
 
02:52:01.790 --> 02:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
written as non- voting
 
02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
members uh so they're members but
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're not voting it's we we we do that
 
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
in a number of capacities for example
 
02:52:11.550 --> 02:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
even a student on a school board may not
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
vote on some issues which are dealing
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
with staff and personal confidential
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
information so um representative Cornell
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
you had and then representative Pell um
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
at our our last subcommittee meeting we
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
spent a great deal of time on this and
 
02:52:28.830 --> 02:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I think a couple of the things like
 
02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:29.870 align:start position:0%
um I think a couple of the things like
two

02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
teachers I I think it said in federal
 
02:52:35.070 --> 02:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
law that you had to have two for this
 
02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
commission that's why we put instead of
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
one we put back the two and I think the
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
other one was the one individual with
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
the disabilities I think it was that one
 
02:52:48.910 --> 02:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
that was two individuals is in law um
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
federal law that that has to be on the
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and then we had a long
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about the um County
 
02:53:01.469 --> 02:53:01.479 align:start position:0%
Corrections because many times um a a
 
02:53:04.110 --> 02:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
young person with disabilities will be
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
placed in the County Corrections for a
 
02:53:10.389 --> 02:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
year and if they aren't getting any kind
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
of special education that really is
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
against the law um because they're still
 
02:53:18.190 --> 02:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
under 21 so they should be still getting
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
it and that you could spend quite a bit
 
02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
of time in in County Corrections and
 
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
also the the disabilities in the par and
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
information center I I can remember from
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
when I was a school counselor that
 
02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
especially the parent information center
 
02:53:34.910 --> 02:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
would come and with the parent and
 
02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
student as their representative to make
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
sure that their rights were being um
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
heard at the school um to make sure that
 
02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
the school was wasn't you know not
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
providing everything that they were
 
02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
entitled to so I always saw them as a a
 
02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:52.950 align:start position:0%
entitled to so I always saw them as a a
special

02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:53:55.990 --> 02:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
education student and parent
 
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative um for that so thank you
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative panel thank you is this
 
02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
committee open to the
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
public yes well it is if if I you know
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
if you know we see we we need that
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
support because it's not technically a
 
02:54:19.469 --> 02:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
hearing this is a work session of the
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
full committee we've had the hearings on
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
this bill no this not the committee
 
02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
we're in right now this committee that
 
02:54:27.319 --> 02:54:28.309 align:start position:0%
we're in right now this committee that
we're

02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
discussing um I I I've been there and
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's over the years it's been managed
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
differently well I guess what I'm saying
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
is if these positions that the the
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
positions we're discussing removing they
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
could always attend the meetings of sack
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
and offer
 
02:54:49.319 --> 02:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
and offer
input

02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.429 --> 02:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
attend not if you're not on the on the
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
committee or the council you got to be
 
02:55:03.309 --> 02:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
recognized nor to speak so if somebody
 
02:55:07.309 --> 02:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask their advice off request
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
and offer of input or they could it's
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
like the school board sometimes you just
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
got to get on the
 
02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
docket yeah represent Myer well thank
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
you I mean obviously this is a a large
 
02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
body to get together to try to do any
 
02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
kind of work and I sensitive to that but
 
02:55:29.229 --> 02:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
you know for the um 12 years I've been
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
on this committee uh both the dis
 
02:55:34.950 --> 02:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center and the parent
 
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
information center have provided
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
valuable information to this committee
 
02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
on on the topics that they deal with and
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand I understand the
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
the trying to get the numbers down but
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
their resources has been so valuable to
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
this community to this group it's I I
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
would hate like heck to have them not be
 
02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
able to sit at the
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
table um I'm assuming this committee
 
02:56:00.319 --> 02:56:01.349 align:start position:0%
table um I'm assuming this committee
makes

02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
makes
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
decisions and so if they're going to
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
make decisions they want to make
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
informed decisions I guess they could
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
these folks these Representatives could
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
attend and try to get their hand in but
 
02:56:13.990 --> 02:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know as well as I that if you don't
 
02:56:15.630 --> 02:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
have a t if you don't have a seat at the
 
02:56:17.429 --> 02:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
table and a right to
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
vote the information can just go out
 
02:56:21.630 --> 02:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
there without not not really being taken
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
seriously so I do have uh Glenn I have a
 
02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
real concern about them not being there
 
02:56:30.429 --> 02:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
because of the what's been said here is
 
02:56:33.469 --> 02:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
far as how they advocate for parents Etc
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
they may not be parents but they do
 
02:56:38.190 --> 02:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
advocate for families Etc and so I I've
 
02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
got serious concerns about the removal
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
of them from this committee okay there
 
02:56:44.590 --> 02:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
there there's one issue I think we need
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
to address or attend to uh for example
 
02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have committees which require that a
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
school administrator be a member of the
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee and just many
 
02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
committees and then you ask your do we
 
02:57:04.349 --> 02:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves should we allow the
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
lobbyists from the school administrators
 
02:57:12.150 --> 02:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
Association be it maybe um um Mark mlan
 
02:57:15.070 --> 02:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
now who is the you know the
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
director of that I don't know if he's a
 
02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or if Jerry fu is a lobbyist or
 
02:57:22.349 --> 02:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh I know that in school boards
 
02:57:25.469 --> 02:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
Association Barett Christina is a
 
02:57:28.510 --> 02:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist but it's but we oftentimes have
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
a school board member put on a committee
 
02:57:32.830 --> 02:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
of type but not necessarily one right
 
02:57:35.229 --> 02:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
out of the office who's the lobbyist
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
should a lobbyist be placed in on a a
 
02:57:41.469 --> 02:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
group like this or should be a member of
 
02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
that Association or organ you
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:55.590 --> 02:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
member lobbyist or somebody from the
 
02:57:57.790 --> 02:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
organization lobbyist might be a member
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
organization but they're also you know
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
I understand your your your comment uh
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
direct I just understand is there anyone
 
02:58:24.429 --> 02:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
on this listing uh this volume of folks

actually it's not still morning I'm the
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
02:59:10.590 --> 02:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
Center and I've been at the disability
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
rights Center for about 18 years now
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
first as an attorney senior staff
 
02:59:17.070 --> 02:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
attorney representing um children
 
02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
through their parents in a variety of
 
02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
matters but really specializing in
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
Education cases for children with
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities a couple years ago our
 
02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
policy director retired and so I am now
 
02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
the policy director and as such I have
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
registered as a lobbyist my the only
 
02:59:35.550 --> 02:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
lobbying I do however is on behalf of
 
02:59:38.190 --> 02:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center my employer
 
02:59:41.630 --> 02:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
always consistent with our strategic
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
plan the our organization's mission
 
02:59:47.309 --> 02:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
which is to advocate for the rights of
 
02:59:48.910 --> 02:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities that
 
02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
includes the students and their parents
 
02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent so is there a conflict if
 
03:00:00.910 --> 03:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're also a lobbyist and a participant
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
on a council like this I don't see a
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
conflict the AG's office was asked to
 
03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this they did not see a
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
conflict I'm still me right I am still
 
03:00:12.429 --> 03:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
an employee of the disability rights
 
03:00:16.269 --> 03:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
Center I have like I and the and my
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
education and this you know the amount
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
of work I've done to learn education law
 
03:00:22.510 --> 03:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
and what the rights are under federal
 
03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
and state law for children with
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities has remained consistent and
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not it's not like I am lobbying for
 
03:00:32.429 --> 03:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else if I was also employed and
 
03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
lobbing for an organization that had
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
interests that were contrary to the
 
03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
interests of the disability rights
 
03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
Center so that I can not necessarily
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
consistently represent our
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
organizations's interest and role in
 
03:00:47.469 --> 03:00:47.479 align:start position:0%
this organization I could see a conflict
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
but I don't see a conflict there where
 
03:00:53.630 --> 03:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
all I'm doing is advancing you know our
 
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
organization's Mission which is to
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that the rights of people with
 
03:01:00.429 --> 03:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
disabilities are
 
03:01:03.309 --> 03:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
met further
 
03:01:05.670 --> 03:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
03:01:08.349 --> 03:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
question just got another
 
03:01:11.389 --> 03:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
question okay so it's not to Karen then
 
03:01:13.389 --> 03:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
not to Ken okay thank you very much
 
03:01:13.399 --> 03:01:14.590 align:start position:0%
not to Ken okay thank you very much
Karen

03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
Karen
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
represent Bon do you have a question um
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you thank you chair um
 
03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious though if you did not
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
have that position would there be
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else who was not a lobbyist
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
that could take the position
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
representing your
 
03:01:29.950 --> 03:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
organization um I don't I don't know
 
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
that there would be another person who
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
would be a be available right now to
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
step into this role we have really
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
limited resources I think that I was
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
appointed because of my expertise and
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
experience representing parent parents
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
well children through their parents and
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
education matters so um I I can't answer
 
03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:51.309 align:start position:0%
education matters so um I I can't answer
that

03:01:51.309 --> 03:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
03:01:55.389 --> 03:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
you did your
 
03:01:58.830 --> 03:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
predecessor was he a lobbyist I believe
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
he was registered as a lobbyist so my
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
predecessor was our former executive
 
03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
director dick Cohen and
 
03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
I'm 80 85% sure he also was a registered
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
lobbyist but MH um you you all may know
 
03:02:14.030 --> 03:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
better than me actually who would no
 
03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:15.630 align:start position:0%
better than me actually who would no
Bonnie

03:02:15.630 --> 03:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
Bonnie
 
03:02:18.990 --> 03:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
probably okay further questions of of
 
03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
Karen it's not so much for Karen but if
 
03:02:24.190 --> 03:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
what you're lobbying for is students and
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
families with disabilities to get their
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
rights that I don't I don't see that as
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
guess I I I think that this even goes to
 
03:02:41.710 --> 03:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
the level of Beyond us right here
 
03:02:45.790 --> 03:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
because this is uh uh every committee's
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
could possibly have this question asked
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
and probably it has to be addressed by
 
03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
and probably it has to be addressed by
another

03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:02:57.070 --> 03:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
attorney um that's employed by the
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
house I in fact it may have been I don't
 
03:03:04.030 --> 03:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
know I I just want to be walking very
 
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
carefully represent Damon and then thank
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you um so I was
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
just going to articulate in the Federal
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
regul ation it says the state must
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
establish and maintain an advisory panel
 
03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of providing policy
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
Guidance with respect to special
 
03:03:22.990 --> 03:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
education and related services for
 
03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in the
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
state would I be correct in thinking
 
03:03:29.229 --> 03:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
that that is in fact a major purpose of
 
03:03:32.590 --> 03:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
your organization yes and it's also a
 
03:03:35.070 --> 03:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
big part of what I do as the policy
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
director disability rights
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
Center so I Echo representative cor
 
03:03:43.229 --> 03:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
Cornell this seems completely compatible
 
03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
and and not a conflict of interest also
 
03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
follow up one more you did say that the
 
03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General reviewed that so this
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
had been asked and the there's an an
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General was asked um
 
03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
this very question and I don't know if
 
03:04:02.349 --> 03:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
she's still with the AG's office but she
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
came to a meeting that we had and said
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
that she did not see a
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
conflict are you talking about an it it
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't remember who it was but
 
03:04:21.510 --> 03:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
it was someone who followed Chris Bond
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
office yeah that was a Liz yeah yeah
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%

03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
further questions of
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
Karen represent Noble you no not not of
 
03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
Karen okay thank you thank you very much
 
03:04:44.590 --> 03:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
Noble thank you Mr chair I I think it we
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
might have some parents that are on the
 
03:04:53.710 --> 03:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
um committee and is it possible that we
 
03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
could hear their opinion on this you
 
03:05:03.430 --> 03:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:07.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
forward hi my name is Karen Stokes and
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
the current chair of the sac committee
 
03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
so I was able to watch the video from
 
03:05:18.229 --> 03:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
the last time um so I was just here if
 
03:05:20.590 --> 03:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
anybody had any questions relating to
 
03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
the current sack
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
makeup so I'll ask you a question we you
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of suggestions as who should
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
or should not be on the council yes as
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair of the council what's your
 
03:05:37.710 --> 03:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I was looking at the
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
numbers and I do want to make sure that
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
you are aware that there's currently 22
 
03:05:45.150 --> 03:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
positions that are not parent positions
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the makeup if you
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
added 16 that still would not give us
 
03:05:51.790 --> 03:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
the parent makeup um after having
 
03:05:53.550 --> 03:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with multiple again I'm
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
just the parent so I don't represent the
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
full sack I just want to make sure I say
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um so we would need more than 16 in
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
order to get a parent majority um and
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
they are not in support of the Dual
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
roles which I kind of think you guys are
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
not um I do say the DRC and the pick
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
I've only been the chair for one meeting
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
and ran very smoothly just want to add
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that um but I did talk with somebody
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
that was on the committee and she's been
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
on the committee for eight years I
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
personally feel that I'm a I'm a parent
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
advocate through pick so I've done their
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
training which is an amazing
 
03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
organization as well as a DRC but I've
 
03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
been told that in the last eight years
 
03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
that there was a member on they have not
 
03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
produced any information or any data so
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
I think they have a wealth of
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
information but how do we get them to
 
03:06:43.229 --> 03:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
share it with us because without that
 
03:06:45.150 --> 03:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
data and without that information it's
 
03:06:47.950 --> 03:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
not overly helpful so again I've only
 
03:06:49.870 --> 03:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
had one committee meeting so my hope
 
03:06:51.429 --> 03:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
would be that there are going to share
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
that data in the future and I have not
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
personally asked them if they're willing
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
to I just don't know they just never
 
03:07:00.190 --> 03:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
have in the last eight years to my
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge thank you yes represent bony
 
03:07:07.469 --> 03:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um would would you
 
03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
say that uh you've been given adequate
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
support from the Department of Education
 
03:07:13.630 --> 03:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
to help the
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
this group achieve its Mission no um as
 
03:07:21.070 --> 03:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
far as the as far as the clerk goes we
 
03:07:22.990 --> 03:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
we were able to find somebody that is
 
03:07:24.910 --> 03:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
apparent that has stepped up to take our
 
03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
minute so that's fine um the internet
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
too I don't know if that's an issue but
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
I I also want to make sure I address
 
03:07:34.510 --> 03:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
that but we did ask um Rebecca fet from
 
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
the due at our last meeting if we had
 
03:07:39.150 --> 03:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
any funds because we wanted somebody to
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
come and help us with a direction um to
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
help us find our our purpose because
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
again I think we all realize we're not
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
very functionable right now which we're
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
not um and the comment that was made to
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
me was you have no money we have money
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
but you have no money um and I think we
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
were asking for under it was a little
 
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
about $600 for somebody to come and help
 
03:08:03.710 --> 03:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
us with our goal we're a parent L
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
committee and and again I'm a
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard member of my town I you know
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
I work for an area agency you know we're
 
03:08:12.229 --> 03:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable but we need direction and
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
without any kind of funds we're it we're
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
kind of stuck which is
 
03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um I'd also like to address
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
the internet it was brought up that we
 
03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a remote option in the last year
 
03:08:26.229 --> 03:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
before I was the chair our remote option
 
03:08:28.349 --> 03:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
is is absolutely deplorable in my
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
opinion um you were there at the last
 
03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
committee so I think that you would back
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
this up per the law it states that you
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to be able to hear and be heard if
 
03:08:40.630 --> 03:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're on a remote option that was not
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
possible we're given the Facility by the
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
doe so they give us the meeting place
 
03:08:49.229 --> 03:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
which is in conquered and then they're
 
03:08:51.910 --> 03:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
all supposed to set up the Wi-Fi and in
 
03:08:53.309 --> 03:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
the last year that I've been on the
 
03:08:55.229 --> 03:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
committee it's pretty much always been
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
an issue um September I don't believe
 
03:09:01.150 --> 03:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
was an issue but June was an issue it
 
03:09:03.469 --> 03:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
our remote option and our remote access
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
is just not feasible for a full
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to have a remote
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
option so that that's a really big
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
concern for some of our parents because
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
as you know you've stated parents are
 
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately dealing with their
 
03:09:19.070 --> 03:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
children with a disability or they have
 
03:09:20.830 --> 03:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
you know illnesses and so having that
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
remote option is really important for us
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's again you were there it it
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
option we got some hands up here sorry
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh represent Dy then represent Cornell
 
03:09:39.309 --> 03:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
then back represent Bon uh thank you Mr
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for answering these
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um
 
03:09:46.389 --> 03:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
are your 16 positions filled right now
 
03:09:46.399 --> 03:09:47.590 align:start position:0%
are your 16 positions filled right now
with

03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
parents um I think we have 15 but our
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
parents don't show up a lot so it would
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
be great if we had more because again
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
these parents are working they're
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with personal issues and with
 
03:10:02.510 --> 03:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities so when you only have the
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
bare minimum of what makes up your
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
parent majority you're probably never
 
03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
going to get a committee where it's a
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
parent majority in voting okay follow up
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
please yeah uh so it's not really a
 
03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
question of needing to find more parents
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
to add it's just being them being able
 
03:10:20.389 --> 03:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
to be there well if you have 22
 
03:10:22.030 --> 03:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
positions that are currently non-parents
 
03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
and you have 16 positions at our parents
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
you don't even need that majority yeah
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
math doesn't really support that thank
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Cornell now
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the doe is in the process or have
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
already moved into the building where I
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
think they allow you to have your
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
meetings might not the video get maybe
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully better so the meeting we had
 
03:10:43.469 --> 03:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
last month has been the meeting that
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
we've used in the last year so I don't
 
03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
think that's the factor where where are
 
03:10:50.670 --> 03:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
you meeting Granite State College at the
 
03:10:54.229 --> 03:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
State College yeah okay yeah and and by
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
the way I just we do ask ahead of time
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
if if the internet and everything is
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
going to be good and we're told yes and
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
then when we get there it's kind of
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
a I don't want to use the term but you
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
know what I'm
 
03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
saying reer you know um I hate to say
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
this but I think there's an elephant in
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
the room that nobody's addressing and
 
03:11:16.590 --> 03:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
that is a lack of resources for this
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee correct so to me it's not the
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
number that are there it's it's the
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
whole approach to dealing with this
 
03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
committee and and that's not addressed
 
03:11:29.630 --> 03:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the law in the uh in the amendment
 
03:11:33.150 --> 03:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
that's here so it's I think we see this
 
03:11:35.469 --> 03:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
often times before the committee where
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
you've got other issues that are out
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
there that can't be addressed by by it
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
and it would seem to me as represent Bon
 
03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
said you know without the kind of
 
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
resources that should be available for
 
03:11:48.510 --> 03:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
the committee whether it be internet
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
whether it be staff whatever it doesn't
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
make any difference who's on that
 
03:11:53.750 --> 03:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee because they're not going to
 
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
show up if it's not going to function
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
right and obviously it needs some it
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
needs some assistance and with the
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that come into the
 
03:12:04.349 --> 03:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
department it was sure as how same to me
 
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
that there ought to be some money put
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
aside so this so this group could in
 
03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
fact function and so I guess that's my
 
03:12:13.150 --> 03:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
frustration as I've looked at listen to
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
this conversation it's not the numbers
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's clear the numbers are an issue no
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
question but it goes Way Beyond the
 
03:12:22.110 --> 03:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
issue of the functionality of this
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
particular committee and not having the
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
right governmental support to make sure
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
that they can meet their mission and I
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
would like to add to that you are 100%
 
03:12:33.550 --> 03:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
correct and I support everything you
 
03:12:36.389 --> 03:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
just said if you're a parent who's been
 
03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
on the committee and we have called
 
03:12:40.349 --> 03:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
parent so I I this is this is truthful
 
03:12:41.790 --> 03:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
when you call a parent and they're
 
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
working hard and they're they're taking
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
care of their kids and they go to
 
03:12:47.229 --> 03:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee and it's just not functioning
 
03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
how much of your time do you waste
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
because there's so many other things
 
03:12:53.070 --> 03:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
that they can do and they want to take
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
their time and they want to join a
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
committee and then in the past year that
 
03:12:58.590 --> 03:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
I've been on it was either run for chair
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
or step down so hopefully this is going
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
to be the change that we have and and we
 
03:13:04.910 --> 03:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
do have some really good parents that
 
03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
are on there but how do we get those
 
03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
parents re-engaged to be able to move
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
forward when you don't have any funds to
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
help you be able to move forward it's
 
03:13:14.830 --> 03:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
that VIs to Circle so thank you for
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
presenting that it's I I'd like to just
 
03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
cut in on this I'm looking at the
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
membership on the council is there a
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
member on this Council from the
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education special
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
education correct Rebecca
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
forette okay I'm trying to find out
 
03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
where she's located on this Litany of
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
people I it's on my phone I can grab
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
it which which part of the state
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
positions what read it what what's it
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
say St
 
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
education well okay that doesn't do it
 
03:13:50.349 --> 03:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
for me uh it doesn't say from the
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education technical
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
support or something such as that I've
 
03:13:56.590 --> 03:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
been over at the department when there
 
03:13:59.190 --> 03:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
has been a member on the committee that
 
03:14:03.269 --> 03:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
provides technical support or is a
 
03:14:03.279 --> 03:14:04.309 align:start position:0%
provides technical support or is a
voting

03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
voting
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
member the the rooms are always set up
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
and ready to go because there is a
 
03:14:10.910 --> 03:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
person from the Department that's
 
03:14:13.870 --> 03:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
participating on that
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
Council our Council uh representative
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
Cornell is always done well our all the
 
03:14:23.469 --> 03:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
Committees for for for CTE are done
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
right when we've been over there for
 
03:14:27.870 --> 03:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
other issues dealing with uh Safety and
 
03:14:30.070 --> 03:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
Security in schools it's always done
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
correctly so I think the error that we
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
have done as a legislator we haven't
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
said that there's an individual from the
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education appointed by the
 
03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner I don't see that on this at
 
03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:43.309 align:start position:0%
commissioner I don't see that on this at
all

03:14:43.309 --> 03:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:14:45.389 --> 03:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
you appointed by the state by the
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
governor that that's that doesn't
 
03:14:50.950 --> 03:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
there's no accountability in that
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
whereas if we have somebody like a Jeff
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
beard or we have somebody like Steve
 
03:14:58.269 --> 03:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
applebe who's there on that committee
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
then I think we're going to tie in all
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
your money issues are there y taken care
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
of your place to meet is there you're
 
03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
streaming and everything online is taken
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
care of Pardon Me
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
18 I think that this is something has to
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
be amended into the bill and I think
 
03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
represent my is correct that we haven't
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
hit what the issue is here and I think
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
this one way to get around it is it a
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
problem that they meet at 5:00 and that
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
that that used to be the big problem
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
they used to meet on Thursday afternoons
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
at 4:00 right in the middle of session
 
03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
and legislators could never never attend
 
03:15:36.189 --> 03:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
because you leave the hall and it's a
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
close vote you you can't leave that it's
 
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
also difficult for parents to especially
 
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
parents that are working to come at I
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't mean you should go during the day
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
I mean having someone from the
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
Department saying you have to stay at
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
5:00 for the
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
meeting that that that is so yes and if
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
I if I could um the the entire time I
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
was on and since then um the special
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
education director has been a member of
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
the committee and in addition I think um
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
on occasion Melissa white from division
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
of instruction um also attends the
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
meetings so there is no lack of
 
03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um participation
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
anyway on the
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
council I think what we're going to have
 
03:16:22.030 --> 03:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
to do before we go much further
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
represent Miler and I both have a
 
03:16:25.870 --> 03:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
meeting starting up at one
 
03:16:28.189 --> 03:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh and I don't even know where
 
03:16:28.199 --> 03:16:30.110 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh and I don't even know where
that

03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:34.510 --> 03:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
is 101 downstairs okay or no that's in
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
the other bill down downstairs so we're
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
not getting through this today but we're
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to have some coming
 
03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
together and trying to fix this uh so
 
03:16:50.030 --> 03:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
maybe what I ought to do right now is a
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
point a smaller group to try to nail
 
03:16:56.429 --> 03:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
this thing down so when we do come back
 
03:17:00.510 --> 03:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
a working group just you know maybe at
 
03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
Max five people we don't want a lot of
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
people uh just to try pardon me
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
24 is there anybody like to be on a
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
working group and to try to nail down a
 
03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:14.309 align:start position:0%
working group and to try to nail down a
little

03:17:14.309 --> 03:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:17:17.710 --> 03:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
bit represent B you have your hand up um
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that um thank you sir Mr
 
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
chair um that both probably both I'm
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
probably speaking for representative
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner but we've already started this so
 
03:17:27.309 --> 03:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
we we'd be more than happy to continue
 
03:17:29.469 --> 03:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
to try to reach is there anybody like to
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
work with representa Tanner and
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
represent Balon and trying to come back
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%

03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
one more time in that on this that's
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to be it because then we're going
 
03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
to have November 13th right on top of us
 
03:17:43.630 --> 03:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's just right around the corner so
 
03:17:48.429 --> 03:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
this anybody else would like to work on
 
03:17:57.510 --> 03:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.189 --> 03:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
um you could do it I'm not saying how to
 
03:18:01.870 --> 03:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
do it just get it
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
done I'll okay folks come up with
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
something really please can can we find
 
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
out I know when Jeff comes to our
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
meetings he also brings technical help
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
with him from his from his Department
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
within the department so it I don't know
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
if if Becky is always going to the means
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
if she could bring
 
03:18:26.110 --> 03:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
someone administrative strative help
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
with her what what the problem has been
 
03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
is that Granite State is their home now
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
but it's just recently they've had areas
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
within that building leased out to other
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
organizations and their leases weren't
 
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
up and so now they're closing and the
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
building is becoming more of one
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
building and with that the technical
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
people are able to get in and give
 
03:18:53.469 --> 03:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
assistance uh I I think what we've got
 
03:18:57.150 --> 03:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
is if we can get like a director or an
 
03:19:01.309 --> 03:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
individual like Becky fet as the person
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
she then has the ability to pull in the
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
technical support there and I know
 
03:19:08.429 --> 03:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
that's what Steve and that's what Jeff
 
03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
do uh so it another director could do
 
03:19:15.309 --> 03:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
the saying um so I don't think it's
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
really where we have
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
to I think the support is there it's
 
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
just it's got to come internally from do
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
doe to make sure things are set up
 
03:19:27.389 --> 03:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
properly um there's you know the the
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Council too
 
03:19:31.229 --> 03:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with that one where they
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
come up with legislation and all that
 
03:19:35.670 --> 03:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's always never had support either
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
the one that's always had to run that
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
was um Susan uh representative out of
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
where she at sugar Hill
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
or Su Ford and so but these this is a
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
notch up though this is a a group which
 
03:19:52.710 --> 03:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
really does need support I think we can
 
03:19:55.229 --> 03:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
do it and I appreciate it if you look at
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's really defined in
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation that a person there is
 
03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're voting or not I don't
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
care but they need to have the technical
 
03:20:06.349 --> 03:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
support has to be
 
03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
there from from the Department amen okay
 
03:20:13.229 --> 03:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
so let's I got four minutes to eat my
 
03:20:13.239 --> 03:20:19.269 align:start position:0%
so let's I got four minutes to eat my
lunch

03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
and I I you can but I'm not going to be
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
able to be here for that you know it's
 
03:20:26.429 --> 03:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
it's just you know I know Mel and I have
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
to get out of here and I think we both
 
03:20:30.189 --> 03:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
have some things we got to do prior to
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
that so um I would advise if there is
 
03:20:37.469 --> 03:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
somebody that from the audience who
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
wants to give some input contact
 
03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
represent cascaden or represent Balon or
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
representa Tanner that are going to be
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
working on this and and so we can get
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
something we will with the other bills
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%

03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
