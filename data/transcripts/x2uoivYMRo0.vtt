24 hours in advance we can get a
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
replacement for you but if we don't know

in advance then we can't um hopefully
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
you have an uh an email account you'll
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%

full-time job one of the few committee
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
assistants that's here year round
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
because there's so much to do and she
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
has to catch up on all the minutes on
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
all the the Committees that we've met
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
after after we finished our session um
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
we're all properly dressed I expect we
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
will be for the rest of the time
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
remember that we're on TV for a lot of
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
this and I will always address you
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
because of the fact we're on TV you know
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say Dan and and Jerry but
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
know it's representative Maguire
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin because it's all
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
going out over TV and being recorded um
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
we have a coffee Fund in this in this
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee and we also have a lunchroom
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
at the back corner there uh there's a
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
little refrigerator some of you might
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
keep a lunch in there I don't know if
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to hold all of them but uh if
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do it there's usually
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
space there um sometimes when we just
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
have a short time for lunch it's it's
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
handy that we can all come back there
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
and there's room for about half of us to
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
eat lunch back there uh if you if you
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
brought your lunch um as I said because
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
of and Janet quite often has goodies
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
there if if everybody pays their $20 a
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
year for the coffee fund and you'll have
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh free coffee and so on for just just
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
for the members of the committee don't
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
invite others in to to use up our coffee
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
um we won't won't have food or or coffee
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
on the table table during our hearings
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you're really thirsty water's okay
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
but don't have stuff on the table we
 
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
always going to have a lot of paperwork
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
we don't want to spill anything on it
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
that makes a stain on you the floor or
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
the paperwork
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
um anybody has a medical issue make sure
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%

chairs will have an office the others
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
you will have assigned in that room
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%

table representative Sweeney and
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
representative Nena um if we have a
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
problem with somebody testifying I may
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
give you a signal to go out and get
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
somebody from security to come in and
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
um fire alarm and we exit out here and
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be assembling across the
 
00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be assembling across the
street

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%

house and in this committee were
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
assigned by the the others um it's a he
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy lift especially with the
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget every other year and unlike other
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
committees we have the best assistance
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
have the legislative budget assistance
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
Democrats in the committee um all the
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
all the bills that will have a fiscal
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
note on them will likely come to us
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
unless it's a fee or a tax and then 11
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
11 14 14 and 11 okay sorry and

00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
straight um
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll see we'll see bills from
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
virtually every committee if they have a
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
committee that and a policy committee
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
and a deals with it it has a cost to it
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
they'll send it to us normally in the
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
first year of the budget we just
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
includeed in the budget if we look at if
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's passed through the house comes to
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
us we'll send it to a division of of
 
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.950 align:start position:0%
us we'll send it to a division of of
appropriate

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
um appropriate subject matter and then
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to include it in the
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget um it's going to be more
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
difficult this year so I've tried to get
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
each policy committee to deal with the
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
spending within their expertise in other
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
words if you're fishing game and
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
somebody says oh we need three new such
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
and such and you say well find another
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
place where you can take three from and
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
replace them with these three rather
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
than come to us and expect us to add
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
more employees so that's one of the
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
things I've asked them to do but we'll
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
see how that works out um but normally
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
in the first year we were able to put a
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
lot of the things in the second year
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little more difficult unless
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
there's a big Surplus
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
um we already have three of our people
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
assigned to the new committee on
 
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.430 align:start position:0%
assigned to the new committee on
education

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
spending representative McGuire
 
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
spending representative McGuire
representative

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
F who pich Müller representative papichi
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
Müller and they'll so they'll
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
be juggling both of those committee
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
Works um it'll affect one we schedule
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
ours um the subcommittees we have three
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
divisions you'll you'll know hear about
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
those in the
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh keep checking the calendar
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
including your personal calendars if you
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
put any bills in that's sometimes the
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
only way you find about oh tomorrow I
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
got a bill I've got to introduce in such
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
and such a place
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
um if you're looking at a bill file to
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
to write the um report on it that goes
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the house do not not remove it from
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
this building uh sit down and work on it
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
also when we have a uh when you make the
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
the motion you'll have to make the
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
report and be ready to go to the floor
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
and have that ready before you leave the
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
building um committee replacement I
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
discussed let people know uh if it's if
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
you call your partisan office then
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
they'll do their best to have someone
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
fill in for you the next day and give
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
them an idea what what the bills are
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
that will be um
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
exact we'll have a lot of people come
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
before us um you'll find conflicting
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from two different
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
Witnesses it's not our role to say wait
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
a minute the last person said that you
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be right no we don't debate
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
them we listen
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
patiently and when we come to the exact
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
session then we'll discuss what we
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
believe the version of the truth was we
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
won't challenge people that come to us
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
because our job is to listen and not
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of searching questions you
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
can have a question if you think they
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
stated something wrong and give them a
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
chance to restate it but if don't argue
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
with them if they
 
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.669 align:start position:0%
with them if they
don't

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
um don't make a speech when you want to
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
make a question just ask the question
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
and get wait till I recognize you to to
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
ask the chair to ask the question
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh and when you when a bill that you
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
have sponsored comes before us you will
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
sit out in the audience rather than at
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
your regular seat and you won't be able
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
to ask the other people that come after
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
you to discuss your bill you won't be
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to ask them questions uh that's
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
just the way it is because it's got to
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
be a fair thing they've got to have a
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
fair hearing rather than a debate with
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
you we will debate it in the executive
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
committee and you can have notes and
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
tell us all the people that said the
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
wrong things and we will listen to you
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
um conflict of interest and recusal
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
might might come about
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
um and make sure that it's known if it's
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
known we should all know it
 
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.190 align:start position:0%
known we should all know it
also

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
um what's the other thing we may have a
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
chance if we have several bills to work
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
on I might put in the calendar uh
 
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
executive sessions may follow if if
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
there's time available in other words we
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to have a have 45
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
minutes on a bill we had 10 left us 35
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
minutes so okay we just heard two other
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
bills before that um without objection
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
from the minor with the ranking member
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
we we'll ask to have an exact session uh
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
on some bills that seemed fairly
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
apparent how how people felt about them
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to fit in those exact
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
sessions just to kind of save us money
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
when we have an executive session it's
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
just us and normally we're hearing from
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
division one then division two division
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
three because we'll hear we'll have most
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
bills will have a full hearing
 
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
here the subject matter will go to the
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate division they'll have
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
another hearing and they'll make a
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
decision and a recommendation to the
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
full committee then when we come back
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
for an exec session for all the bills
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
that have been before the committee
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
we'll start with division one we'll go
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
through them
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go through division two
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
division three and so on and you will
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
tell us we will know when we sit down
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
what the recommendation was from the
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
division which will help help us guide
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
us to how we'll decide um the people
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
that make the Motions will likely uh
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
write the report and defend it on the
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
floor uh committee report Minority
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
Report uh make sure we know if you're if
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're on the other side and you and you
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure there's a Minority
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
Report make sure that that The Minority
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
Report is known and we'll have that in
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
the in the uh calendar as well so I want
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
to say more about the legislative budget
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
assistant we we have the most work of
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
any committee but we have the most help
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and some of you are used to running back
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
and forth across the street in other
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
committees to try to get an amendment
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
these people know how to do it a lot
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
quicker so I will turn it over to to uh
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant Mike
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
Kaine and he will explain what what you
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
have before you and you have a nice
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
briefing that he's going to go over and
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
also uh another thing that I put on each
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
of your
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
places this is a list of
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
paychecks that the treasurer has given
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
me so when you have a group come before
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
you and you look at the page and the the
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
the uh the numbers in the column will
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
tell you where to look like 02700 for
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
Employment Security Department and how
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
many employees they have
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
because what I've discovered in 16
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
budgets that I've now the 16th budget is
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
that they quite often pad the number of
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
employees and then when you try to ask
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
the question well how many are really
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
working well you know we had a bunch of
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
people that are going to already retire
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
and we got some more people in the
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
pipeline and we're interviewing more
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know this is the number we hope we'd
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
get and you never hear the true number
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you'd say I used to the
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
last budget I had one month of what the
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
real paycheck yeah but we were we were
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
had more people coming so this way we
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
can look back and see how many people
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
you had over the whole year so don't
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
come in and add 10 or 15 more employees
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
to it this is going to be a tight budget
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the money will come from
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
not funding empty position
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing that for years we
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
do our best to avoid it this is the
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism I've chosen the uh Treasurer
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
can give me an accurate account of how
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
many paychecks get issued to that
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
Division and if you didn't have 150
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
paychecks issued over the last year why
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
are you asking for 150 people when the
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
most you've had is
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
135 so these are these are some of the
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
things that I hope will save us money as
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
we go through this budget those are the
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
things that I want each you to have a
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
copy of that division two and three are
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
on the back because they don't have
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
nearly as
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
many departments to deal with as
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
division one does so those are a good
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
guide as you look at their
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
proposal this is how many people we want
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is how many people you had for a
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
whole year so very handy stuff we can
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
save a lot lot of money by not funding
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
vacant positions
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
is thank you for reminding me um any
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions on having laptops iPads on
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
the desk I know some of you use that for
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know taking notes so as long as
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
you're not using it as a
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
distraction then fine because I see
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that for a while so
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way it works that's
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
the way it works and you know you're not
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking phone calls on it or anything
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%

Pam Alis has been with our office for
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
close to 17 years uh we also have um an
 
00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:22.599 align:start position:0%
audit division of 22 Auditors currently
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
we usually run between 22 and 24 uh
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
split almost evenly between performance
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
Auditors and financial Auditors and
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
they're located outside of the State
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
House in the TD Bank building uh across
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
the street from the former holiday
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
in so I'm going to begin um the quick um
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
I call it a quick orientation um we
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
stopped calling it a budget briefing
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
because it is 93 pages but I can
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee you I will not be going
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
through every page this is more of a
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
reference document we do post it online
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
um so you can use this as a coaster or
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
placeholder uh but we do have it online
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
for members of the public and it does
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
have some good information relative to
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
budget terms you're going to be hearing
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the new members and for members
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the public um documents you should
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
get used to seeing as we go through the
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
process um and other things it's
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
probably the smallest document we're
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
going to be handing to you because when
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
the budget comes out uh you'll be
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
receiving an 800 page document of house
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill one for the
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and probably another 100
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
or so pages with a trailer bill so um
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
this is just the beginning we'd like to
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
break you in by handing a an unwieldy
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
document to you right off the start but
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
I I'll walk you through this uh just on
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
page two or page one uh the second page
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
right behind the cover is just a staff
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
directory uh we're located in State
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
House Room 101 and 102 and we also have
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
some basement offices uh but you can see
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
a staff listing as well as our numbers
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
and the new email addresses you may have
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
all been notified that the journal code
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
is moving from an
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
l.n. us to a simpler gc. nh.gov I
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
believe this will be going live um next
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
week um you can still email us at either
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
address and it'll come through to us uh
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
but we did just want to make sure since
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
it is a document online we have the the
 
00:37:18.839 --> 00:37:20.710 align:start position:0%
it is a document online we have the the
new

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
structure on page two are just some
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
common terms to find for those of you
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
who have not been uh part of fin Finance
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
um there are some um some good
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
definitions here I will not going
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
through all of them one of the most
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
important you're going to hear is
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
accounting unit accounting unit is a
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
component of the budget um for your
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
agencies on where a certain program is
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
funded um so there are hundreds several
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
hundred accounting units that you'll be
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
seeing in your divisions uh so as you
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
hear that term uh there's usually a
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
number code that goes along with it that
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
our analyst will walk you through
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
today appropriation being the
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
authorization granted by the legislative
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
body um the appropriation is an
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
authorization to expend so it's
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
basically the you're giving the agency
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
the okay to spend up to a certain amount
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
um Appropriations are also sometimes
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
granted through the fiscal committee
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
which is a 10- member uh Joint Committee
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the general court who approves
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
additional acceptance of additional
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds and other funds in in rare
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
cases in minimal cases for General funds
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
for judicial counsel uh Department of
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
Justice and Department of Corrections
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other agencies
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and just a footnote for the new
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
members what's a footnote you'll see
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
text in house bill one that will have
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how the Appropriations
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
can be spent or how they can be
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
transferred for instance you may have a
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
footnote in the budget which our analyst
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
will go over with you that maybe allows
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
the agency to not lapse the funds not or
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
carry forward any unexpended funds until
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the next year uh May Place limits on
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the funds can be
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
transferred in or out into those
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
particular class lines which are the
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
smaller unit of expenditures and uh laps
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
is a number you're going to be hearing
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh laps is a number is basically
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
unexpended Appropriations uh for the
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
past four years it hasn't received a lot
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
of attention because the revenues from a
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
budget perspective were over budget uh
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
if we go back uh a few years
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
ago this was an item that the lapse
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
number is the unexpended Appropriations
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the legislature assumes will not be
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
spent to allow a balanced budget so it's
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
up to the executive branch to balance
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
the budget which assumes the amount of
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming in the amount of
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
authorized expense and then the the
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
labster unexpended Appropriations and
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
that can occur from things like
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies staff vacancies be uh being
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
one of the big uh portions of laps
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder had asked how much
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh salaries and benefits make up of a
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
total budget usually between 25 and 26 %
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
of your general fund spending is uh U
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
employment um so laps figures uh from
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
estimates that are different from what
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
was projected almost two years ago so
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
even though the the finance committees
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
do the best they can to appropriate what
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
they think will be needed for the next
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
two years things change contracts take a
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
little longer um the economy changes
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
utilization changes for programs and so
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
that lapse does occur and then a surplus
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
deficit statement you'll see in an
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
example later on in here um which is
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
really a document that we prepare the
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
governor prepares and then we prepare
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the House and Senate to ensure that
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
the state passes a balanced budget plan
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
years RSA uh 9 is the uh portion of of
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
the state statute relative to
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh and expenditures uh
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
just a c a couple of um sections out
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
take you to is on page four uh RSA 92 is
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
transmission to the legislature this is
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
a requirement that the governor present
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh his or her budget by February 15th of
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
the um odd number year so this year
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
February 15th falls on a Saturday uh
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
typically the governor will present uh
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
to the Full House and Senate um in joint
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
session my guess is I don't know the
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
exact dates you'd have to reach out to
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
the governor my guess so would happen
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
around the 12th or 13th most likely it's
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
not going to happen on Saturday but it's
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
never happened before but you never say
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
never so um but that is the deadline in
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
statute that the governor must submit uh
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
the operating budget to the legislature
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh in addition that was put in a few
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
years ago RSA
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
992a uh on top of the operating budget
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that goes along with it
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
that is called referred to as the
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill and those are all the
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
statutory changes necessary to implement
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
it didn't effectuate the changes in the
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
budget uh there were a couple years ago
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
we put in uh we being the the state of
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire put into the irsa uh a
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
requirement that the trailer Bill also
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
be submitted by the governor by February
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
15th um for some of you who have been on
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
finance for a while there were years
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
when you wait a good three weeks prior
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
to seeing the language that is in the
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill and it does delay the
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
ability of the finance committee to
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
really look at that budget policy and
 
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:29.069 align:start position:0%
really look at that budget policy and
make

00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
decisions uh within a short period of
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
time uh on page five there's one
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
sentence I'll point out up top that was
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
just added um although there was always
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
a requirement that or not always but
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the last couple years a requirement
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
to submit the trailer Bill uh it was in
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
printed format um in an electronic
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
computer format but it wasn't publicly
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
posted online so members of the public
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
and members of of the legislature would
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
hear what was potentially in the trailer
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill but until it was introduced in
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 um they couldn't see it so
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
the new sentence was added that um the
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
document shall be um available printed
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
format one electronic but and shall be
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
publicly posted on the department of
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services website on the
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
data transmittal um so there's a
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that by February 15th all
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
the text of houseville 2 needs to be put
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
on the department of administrator's
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
website uh so that should help uh the
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
the members of Finance understand and
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
members of the public understand what
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
budget Mr chair yes thank you I just
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
want to ask a clarifying question so
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
what is the delay then are you all are
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
you in your office and uh are you
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
drafting hb2 at that point are you just
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
getting the information from the
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
governor's Budget on the 15th and then
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
you have to draft the actual language
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
like what is that delay yes thank you so
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
we will uh our office will receive and
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services who
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
drafts legislation we receive a copy
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
from the governor's legal council uh of
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the text of House Bill Tu the office of
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
legislative services will then spend
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
usually takes about a week to two weeks
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
depending on how large it is to actually
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
draft and introduce a or draft a
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation for introduction in house
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
bill to so because the trail Bill
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
usually has several changes to statute
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
various stat you uh various effective
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
dates um components that do relate it
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
does take the drafters the legisl
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
drafters usually about a week to two
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
weeks um usually closer to the two weeks
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
to get the final text the legislative
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
text available and that has been the
 
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
delay in the past because the public
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
would not see any of that text until
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
that bill was introduced hopefully this
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
the sentence that was added last year
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
will at least have that text in a non
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
let necessary not a legislative format
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
yet there will be some tweaks to it but
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
the subjects will be there it'll be in
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
the best uh attempt by the governor's
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
office to put it into um statutory
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
language uh and then we'll have the
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
final but that will at least get each
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
division will start to work on their
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
portions they'll have an idea of um what
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
they need to change what they agree to
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
what they need to learn about so great
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you and uh as I understand
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
the tradition the the goal is for hb1
 
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.910 align:start position:0%
the tradition the the goal is for hb1
and

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 to have uh the the chair and the
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
division chairs as sponsors and
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of hb1 and hb2 and then it
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually does become the finance
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee's bill
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct and that it's
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
important to note that the the governor
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
will recommend their budget but it does
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
not become a bill until the legislature
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
makes that introduction of both Health
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
Bill and one two um we go to the house
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
deadlines this year
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
um on page 20 um crossover the last day
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
for I'm going to start with the
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
crossover day last day to act on all
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
house bills is April 10th um that means
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
that all bills including the budget need
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be reported out by this committee on
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
April 3rd um our analysts will go uh
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
work with you over the next uh several
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
weeks uh once we do get the budget to uh
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
provide some deadlines to you to help
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
you to meet that goal typically one or
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
two days prior to the reporting out of
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
the committee uh the divisions will
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
present their uh budget recommendations
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
to the full committee for a vote which
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
will then be after the vote will be
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
compiled into one document so your final
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
vote will be around April 3rd um as
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
representative wer said the workload of
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
house Finance is significant uh not only
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
for the budget but between 50 and 100
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
bills depending on how they go through
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
the policy Committees of bills with
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
potential fiscal impacts on all the
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that you're going to look at uh
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
you'll get them later because the policy
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
committees are currently going to start
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
to work on those bills now you'll have a
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
short time period and on top of that we
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
like to throw the budget into it as well
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be um quite the busy
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
time almost like a holiday season for uh
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
for legislation it's just overwhelming
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
at times but we're here to help you
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
through that to make sure you meet all
 
00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:32.309 align:start position:0%
through that to make sure you meet all
those

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
deadlines page 22 is the um it's an
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
operating budget process agency phase
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
has started sorry yes no I I just wanted
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
to say before we leave this uh house
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
deadlines there's there's sort of an
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
unofficial thing that I I think Finance
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
members may want to keep an eye on and
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
that is that um right now the the
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
speaker is planning to do a winter break
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh the winter break is 24 through 28
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
February and uh in division 3 we're
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
hoping to have gotten our work done to
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
the point to where we can actually take
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
that week and and do something with it
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
but but so for the new people in
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
particular you just want to keep a be
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
aware and stay in touch with your
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
division chair on what you're going to
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
do that week you may have a chance to go
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
get warm somewhere or uh this continue
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
to toil away in a committee room
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere traditionally this committee
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't take the break because we so we
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
just need the time the other the other
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
things are we might end up working
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
weekends or till 10:00 at night so um if
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
the LBA is pretty good at scheduling
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
everything for us and and trying to keep
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
us to five days a week and and you know
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
full days but uh normally we we stay
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
here during that during that vacation
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
time because we don't get interrupted as
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
much by other committees especially the
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we've got some of our
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee members that are doing double
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
duty so that'll be one of the few weeks
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we they won't be called away so do
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
your best not to schedule something for
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
you in our um the analysts working with
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
your division whatever deadlines you
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
want or whatever schedules you have
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that the agencies are in
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
and the topics are addressed in that
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
manner um I'm lucky to have such a
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful staff who does work very well
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
with the divisions to make sure you'll
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
meet your deadlines so there's no
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
question about that uh on page 22 is
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of the operating budget
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
process actually actually started back
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
in March where the agency phase the
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
budget agencies start presenting their
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 budget into the budget system
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh which they have until October they
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
then present a governor uh they receive
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
um instructions from the governor on
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
what what they should present what are
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
the targets what are the what are the
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
goal of the governor as far as where
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
they see revenues at the time agencies
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
and their agency budget request it
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
varied by agency but overall about a 4%
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
reduction uh in what they received in FY
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
25 uh Governor's phase began uh upon the
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the governor's um right
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
before Veterans Day the the governor's
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
budget hearings and then we'll continue
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
through February 15th this is a a a
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget phase those first
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
that we're not involved in we have no
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
access to the budget system or
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
information or what's going on we only
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
hear basically from our agencies no
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
detail but what's happening and then
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
from February to April this year the
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
house will have the budget which will go
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
very quick it's usually even though it
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
looks like two months it's probably
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
closer to 6 weeks when you look at your
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines to report to have public uh uh
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings to have a presentation
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the Full House it's about 6 weeks so
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a tight time frame uh
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
but we'll get you through that when the
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
house passes their budget will'll go
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate who has until the
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
beginning of June to pass their portion
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
which will then come back to the house
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
for either U concurrence request for
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
commune conference or non-c concurrence
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
and then after that will'll go to the
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
governor's office um as far as the
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
governor's phase is involved it's going
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
on right now
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
um we're hearing just from the press and
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
and just looking in the governor had
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
went back to agencies for further
 
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.710 align:start position:0%
went back to agencies for further
reduction

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh so you may have heard during the
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
governor's budget hearings the impact of
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
a 4% reduction or 2% reduction or an
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
agency uh we don't know the exact number
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
but we have heard agencies are putting
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
together additional reductions for the
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
governor uh so we know they're hard at
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
work uh the executive branch right now
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
so that Governor AOK can present a
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
balanced budget by uh February 15th uh
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
revenues is one of the big and kind of
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
going off script here but revenues is
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
one of the big questions uh right now we
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
were almost we being the state almost
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
$50 million under Revenue through
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
December um usually if you are under
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue um in December you'll most
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
likely end the year under plan so we're
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
taking a look at 25 right now um with
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
the revenues and how they're going to
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
perform March and April being the two
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
largest months unfortunately you'll be
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
so deep into your budget process uh you
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
won't have the final numbers but you
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
have a good indication through Midway
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
and March and where you think those
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
revenues Ways and Means Committee will
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
be providing this committee with uh um
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
revenues uh estimated revenues and that
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
timing is depending on discussions
 
00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
amongst leadership agencies are
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
typically hesitant to uh provide any
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
solid estimates until they work with the
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
governor who they do um who who is their
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
um their employer in the executive
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
branch so we know they're working close
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
I would be you should talk to the chair
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
of ways and means but typically around
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning of March you'll have an
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
idea where your revenues are it's hard
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
to predict where they'll go but most
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
likely they will be low um and that's
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
just a just a ballpark estimate but once
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
the governor comes out with her
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
estimates on on the middle of February
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
you'll have a good sense of uh what is
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
the what you have in front of you um
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be different than the last
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
few years those the members who have
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
been on the committee the last few years
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
um um it's
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
it was still hard it's always very hard
 
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
there's always needs out there that the
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
state needs to take care of there's
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
always changes in policy the state needs
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
to aurass uh from a revenue perspective
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues were performing very
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
well over the last few years uh but
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's ended and it's going to going to
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
end and uh that's why you have the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
agencies working so hard with Governor
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
right now um and very very hard to
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
predict for 26 and 27 wayy means house
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
ways means sen ways means it's a very
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
hard task in front of them to determine
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
where the revenues will be for the next
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
2 years um one of the major reasons is
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
business taxes being your largest
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
revenue for the general and education
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund are so volatile and so hard
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
to predict but you do have a great
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Department of Revenue
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
Administration who work closely with
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
both ways and means committee to give
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
them the best estimates where they are
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
and usually at the end of the process
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature does a pretty good job
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
of um coming to an agreement of where
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
up just to uh just samples of what uh a
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
budget looks like um if we go into um
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
the pages are uh basically for the
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
online version but it's about page 25
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's just more numbers uh in code this
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
is a very un non-reader friendly
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
document but this is a copy of house
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill one these are the Appropriations
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
that are put into the accounting system
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
so as the agencies are ready to pay make
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
payments uh payroll bills these are the
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
accounts that they come off of in the
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
event that these accounts are not the
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
proper place to have the money the
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
agencies uh for any transfers over
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
$100,000 has to ask the fiscal committee
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
for approval to make that transfer uh we
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's allowable and then
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
it goes forward but $800 pages of
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
numbers like this is really hard to find
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for this is actually
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
summarized which is kind of funny
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
because there's um object codes beneath
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
the classes uh probably 20 for each one
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that's a very hard document to look
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
at so the the classes the Personnel
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
Services in class 10 benefits in class
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
60 are really uh consolidated into one
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
so if you have a constituent or you're
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
interested in one certain program it's
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
very hard to find in here reach out to
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
us we'll locate that for you and
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to ask agencies and
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
dig deeper you'll have $200 million
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
class lines in health and human services
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
that fund 40 or 50 contracts so but
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to see that
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
from house one nor will your
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
constituents or the public so we can
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
help dig down and provide that
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
information to you ask the agency to
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
provide that detail to you um and also
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
just to um remind everyone we share
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
everything online we put everything
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's handed out in the division online
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
so that the members of the public uh and
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature when you're
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
doing other things can go back and
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
reference those documents um to kind of
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
pay attention to um what each division
 
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
pay attention to um what each division
is

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
doing yes thank you Mr chair I wonder if
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
if you could just um
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
identify uh which of the ite items on
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
this this sample page tie back to the
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
definitions on page two you know uh
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
accounting unit category class line
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
what's an example of each of those thank
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so accounting unit
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
if we look at the example of uh House
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
Bill one um the what we refer to as
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
accounting unit or the on the left hand
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
side of the page the 01 General
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
01044 0410
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
1170 we consider that to be the full
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
chain of the accounting unit as you get
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
into looking at the budget a little more
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
you'll start referring to the accounting
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
unit by the last four for instance
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
1170 um depending on your division but
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
that is the accounting unit um the next
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
the three digits but below that with the
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
the classifications of the
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations those are called
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
classes so class 11 for the Senate
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
Personnel Services unclass classified
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
class 060 is benefits um in class um
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
just another example class 080 is out of
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
state travel uh so there are unique
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
these are all unique classes for each
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
agency so that there's consistency
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
across the agency and the accounting
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
units that the spending is happening in
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
the same account so when representative
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
wer asked a question of kind of how much
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's uh salary and benefits as a
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of the budget we'll use a
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
budget by class because we know it's
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
consistent across all departments and
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
we'll just add the percentages there so
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
and then um the footnote that I
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
referenced previously if you look it's
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
called organization notes you can see
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's an aster um and in this in uh in
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
this case it's president of the Senate
 
00:58:35.789 --> 00:58:35.799 align:start position:0%
designating permanent employees and the
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
benefits that they're eligible to
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
receive so you'll see the aster you'll
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
see the the note the word note uh when
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
those footnotes do come up um and so
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
that's from that page I think those are
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
the the main pieces of information
 
00:58:51.039 --> 00:58:52.789 align:start position:0%
the the main pieces of information
you'll

00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
need sure um
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
a document that we will prepare is on on
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
page 32 it's called a compare document
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
um the governor will present a budget
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
and the house is going to make changes
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
to that budget both in house bill one
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
and House Bill two uh we prepare
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
document called a a compare report so
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
you can see the differences between what
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
the house is proposing and what the
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
governor is proposing we run this on a
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
regular basis back in our office to make
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
sure that we're keeping track of all the
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
ch es so we can present uh estimates to
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the chairs to let them know that excuse
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
me that their budget is balanced and and
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
to track all those changes um so for
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
instance if you were to look at that
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
compare report you can see um I believe
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's under Consultants um the house
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
added $10,000 to the Senate uh and they
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
reduced under Personnel Services $10,000
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
so you can see the class line they make
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
the changes and then the total this was
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
a net zero but uh you'll have this for
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
every account accounting unit uh that
 
00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.789 align:start position:0%
every account accounting unit uh that
will

00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
print page uh 34 if you're wondering why
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's a one andit two and they're not
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
Al together well the Constitution does
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
not allow changes to statute to be
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
included in the budget bill so the
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
legislature and their wisdom has
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
determined that we can just have a bill
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
follow it along call it the trailer Bill
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 2 and that will have all
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
the necessary statutory changes and then
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
comply with um the constitution on that
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
side on page 35 as beginning of House
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh just the um now these are all
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
the a couple examples what does House
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 do that house bill one can't do
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
um well it can't rename divisions of the
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
without making changes to statute so
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
that has to be into house bill too uh
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
authorizing agencies separate from
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
what's authorized in RSA to fill
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions that needs to be made
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
in House Bill too so our analyst will
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
work with you any changes you're
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
proposing in the budget that we believe
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
needs to have a corresponding house
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
build two change we will assist you in
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
drafting those um and it's become pretty
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
large over the last uh couple of
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
years few hundred sections which is a
 
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.029 align:start position:0%
years few hundred sections which is a
lot

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
um I do remember the day the good good
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
old days when there could be 10 or 12
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
sections but it has grown over time um
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
another one of the reasons it's grown is
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of uh changes um
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the budget that do require
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
changes in statute if you're going to
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
require uh Dees to no longer do
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
something you have to make sure there's
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
not a statutory requirement to do so uh
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
but the other reason is bills uh as
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder mentioned this
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
several bills are going to come to house
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
finance there's several bills are going
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
to go to Senate Finance um there are
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
1,00 bills that will probably be
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
introduced at the beginning of this
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
section that uh the session that are
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
going to go through the policy
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
committees and live or die through there
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh over the last couple of years we've
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
noticed uh both the house and the Senate
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
um if there's a major policy that they
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
want uh sometimes they include it in
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill too so it may be something
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
the house has passed or they know that
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the Senate may not want to include in
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
their proposals for legislation that
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
they'll put into house bill too Senate
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
does the same thing watch what happens
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
with their bills over in the Senate
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
maybe put them to the house bill too uh
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
why because then it's a simpler to kill
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
a bill on its own it's harder to kill a
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill when it's part of a larger process
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's what's happened over the
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
last uh couple of years that may or may
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
not continue um but it's something that
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
because that does happen our analysts
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
from the be uh moment it's introduced we
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
are tracking bills that go through the
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee even if they aren't in house
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill one or two we're paying attention
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
because at one time they may come here
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh to finance and make a 20 to the
 
01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.230 align:start position:0%
uh to finance and make a 20 to the
budget

01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
can I just make a point on that sure so
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
the constitution in the in the section
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
just prior to the one you mentioned
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
requires that all money bills start in
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
the house so what the Senate will
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
frequently do when they want to spend
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
money on X they might have a Bill of
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
their own they pass it and then they
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
table it and then they modify House Bill
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
two because it's a house bill to to make
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
that change right so so they can't
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
effective they get around that
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional Thing by changing House
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
Bill a house bill to do it rather than
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
it yes the legislative is very cre
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislature is very creative over the 25
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
years I've seen a lot haven't seen
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
everything and like but uh yes the
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
Senate will table a lot of bills you'll
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
see Senate Finance with a lot of
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
introduced bills with Appropriations
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
that they'll table in the past bills
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
that were tabled maybe they didn't uh
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
they go forward and
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh they die on the table at the end of
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
the two years but with the Senate they
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
will hold out because there will be
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
introduced Senate bills with
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and the Senate just does
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
not know if they can fit it within their
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
budget proposal yet so they'll hold it
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
off to the side eventually put it into
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
house bill two if they decide um on page
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
46 it's uh just a onepage of a surplus
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
statement just to give you an example of
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
what it will look like uh at the end of
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
the process a beginning balance of a
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
year for the general and education trust
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
fund estimated revenues uh from the
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
governor house Ways and Means or Senate
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
ways of means uh Revenue adjustments uh
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue adjustments usually changes in
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 or other policy Bills going
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
through uh the legislature that do have
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
an impact on revenues uh what the uh
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
ways of Means Committee asked in the
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
house is to uh estimate base revenues
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
what are the revenues based on current
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
law not on what's proposed uh but on
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
current law so that's what you'll get
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
from house ways means but there will be
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
sections in uh policy other bills and in
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that may impact revenues uh
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
if there are bills that the house is uh
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
passing and in favoring or including
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
House Bill two those will be the revenue
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
adjustments uh that you'll see on uh row
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
five and so we'll track those throughout
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
the process we want to make sure that
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
yes Finance is proposing a balanced
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
budget based on the revenues and
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations you have but if we are
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
aware of anything going on in the house
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the Senate that has an impact we
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the legislature passes
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
is a balanced budget so uh there's a
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
probably a three-page schedule two that
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
feeds up into this that has all the
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
detail of the different bills and
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and impact on revenues
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
just so we can keep track of all of that
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure a balanced budget um budget
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
Appropriations appropriation adjustments
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
lapses which I talked about um just a
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
couple numbers uh $76 million was the
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
estimated lapse in 24 um the agencies
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
actually came in with a $52 million lap
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
so they missed the lapse for the first
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
time in several years um paying
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
attention on 25 the estimated lapse is
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
$17.7 million of General funds that uh
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature and Governor initially
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
signed say that would not be spent
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that fiscal will start
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
receiving reports on fiscal will receive
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
a report uh in January from the
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services on
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
their estimated laps back in December
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look at it it's only about
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
$30 million cuz it's very early in the
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year there's not an $80 million
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
shortfall um but it is something that
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal is going to be paying attention
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
to and finance is going to be paying
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
attention to uh but chairman wer had put
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
a provision at the house bill to uh a
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago to ensure that
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
Department administrative services start
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
updating the legislature on these laps
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
estimates uh the best held secret up uh
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
before um but to provide that
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
information to the
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and then um we'll have
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
similar Surplus statements in division 2
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
for your Highway fund uh education trust
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
fund and your fishing game fund um just
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out the caer when we
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
talk about beginning balances and what
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
are we going to start the current fiscal
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
year we're in is fiscal year
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
25 um you may have heard the annual
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report that's
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
the Statewide um um annual report that
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
will provide the be the audited
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
beginning balances for the current
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so for 25 so what money was
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
left over in the end of 24 that has been
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
delayed the release of that has been
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
delayed it's typically released in
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
December um that the extension was
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
granted by fiscal committee to push that
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
release date out to January 31st uh due
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
to uh a significant change in the
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
financial systems at liquor uh there
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
will be a further request to extend that
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
through the end of March uh which is
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
pretty late during a budget session it's
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
all related to this big transition from
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
liquor uh over into this new accounting
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
system our Auditors and liquor have to
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
identify every dollar uh to make sure
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
both systems are up to date and there's
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of testing that's required yes
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
representative so that's going to make
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
it a little more difficult for us
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
because we won't even know what lapsed
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
and what was the beginning amount of
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
money we had to start with with like
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
this shows here until after we've
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
finished with the
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
budget yes and the governor even
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't like it even more uh
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
the governor is going to be presenting a
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
budget and making the best most of the
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
other components of the annual financial
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
report won't move you might see a $10
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
million move one way or the other uh
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
liquor hopefully doesn't move any
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
further than it had from the beginning
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
so although not officially the audit
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
version there should be a good
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
there will be a good number that the
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
governor will begin with and the house
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
will have and as that's updated it will
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
swing a few million dollars just through
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
the normal audit activity but you'll
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
have I think you'll have a good base not
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
a final base but a good base where 20 uh
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
25 will be and then I'll provide these
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
snapshots throughout the year I
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
presented one to house ways means
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week of where we think 25
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
will end based on spending based on
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue Etc
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane just to make sure I understand
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
correctly we uh have uh still work to do
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
on the liquor
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
numbers while not an acfr will we have
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
the confidence that the numbers for
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
every other division will be as accurate
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
they as they would have been in a final
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
acfr so is the only uncertainty in the
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
liquor side or are we going to have
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
uncertainties in other places we will
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
have certainty I I work with Dana call
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
who's the com controller to get updates
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
on numbers who provides estimates of if
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's swings one way or the other uh
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
so it won't be audited but it'll be
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
pretty certain and you'll have some
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
movement um with like I wouldn't see
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
significant movement so anything the
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
governor puts out in her Surplus
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
statement and anything that we provide
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the house will be pretty certain just
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
not audited until it's finalized
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure okay um and through no fault just
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
to point out I know fisc will be talking
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
about it why is there a delay there
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't been delay in a while you know we
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
do have to look back uh 15 years or so
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
before there was delay uh in audit but
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
this is a significant change to Liquor's
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Financial system one that've been
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
working on for over a decade that was
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
implemented at the end of April um of
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
the other fiscal year you have to make
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
sure both systems line up and every
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
dollar is accounted for liquor there was
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
a delay getting that information because
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that our Auditors
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
have the right information our Auditors
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
need time to understand that system to
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
give when the final audit is issued
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers so although it is
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
delay it is a necessary delay in my
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
opinion just to make sure we're giving
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh the state and and the public the
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
proper numbers um so there are a couple
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh just two uh charts we included in
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
this and I won't I won't take too much
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
longer but I'll answer some questions
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
but the operating budget for 2425 total
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds about $ 15 uh billion you can see
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
the top green line up there is federal
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
funds almost $4.7 million is federal so
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's on page it's in the staple 49 but
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's up top because we have it
 
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
paginated based on the uh web thing so I
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
do apologize so page 49 uh right after
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
the example of the fishing game Surplus
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
statement you'll see this uh up line
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
chart uh federal funds have about 4.7
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
4.8 general fund the next largest source
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
at about 3.7 uh other funds of about 2.9
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
almost 3 billion ion dollar of other
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
funds those are transfers relative to
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
doit that is agency income restricted
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
for Agency use so that's a significant
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget that you'll all be
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking at and education fund at about
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
2.5 Highway fund about 563 million
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
Turnpike 292 liquor 178 if you look at
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
liquor in the total you'd see it's a
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
smaller number as far as your as your
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
budget figures are concerned uh fishing
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
game about 33 and sweep sakes a little
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
under 32 so we know um that's where as
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
far as the source of funds where that
 
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.750 align:start position:0%
far as the source of funds where that
comes

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
from I I I I do have a question um since
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not in division two could could
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
you just remind me um what the key
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
source is for funds going into the
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
education fund and what the what the uh
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
the current standards are for keeping
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
those money segregated from the general
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
fund yep the largest not a long
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
explanation just kind of a highlight uh
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax is um the largest
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's about 300 over two years this is
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
a two-year chart that's about $720
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
million the Statewide property tax um
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then you have business Enterprise
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
taxes another few hundred million so
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
those are the two main components all
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
lottery Revenue any Lottery profit needs
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
to by Statute and Constitution be used
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
for Education that goes into the
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so we can provide
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
it we'll provide a breakdown and
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
divisions of those components how that
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
money is spent in the education trust
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
fund is driven by Statute what is
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
allowable and and that determination is
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
also made during the budget process
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
there have been items that have been
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
moved to the education trust fund over
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple years uh that the
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
statute was changed to allow that so
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
that will be up to all of you and the
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to make that determination
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the event that something you want to
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
spend education trust fund on another
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
spend education trust fund on another
use

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
Mickey uh in division 2 will make sure
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
that statute is consistent with the
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
actions that you're
 
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.830 align:start position:0%
actions that you're
taking

01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay and if we go um just to the pie
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
chart um the categories on page 50 this
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the pie charts representative
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
wer will do the couple other pie charts
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
you like we've been doing for the last
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
20 years but on kind of where the
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
sources of funds are where the
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
categories are uh Revenue
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh but this one is by category so if you
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
look at the $15 billion of the budget
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
for 2425 you can see a large piece of
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
high down the bottom in representative
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards that's division three uh that's
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so uh Health
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
and Human Services makes up over 50% of
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
the budget pushing close to 60%
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what the governor presents
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the larger followed by
 
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
education education trust fund uh and
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
general funds that's $3.4 billion
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
and then you have other uh category one
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
of General government which Jack Mullen
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
will be working with division one is
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
about a billion uh category two and
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
three not including safety and fishing
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
game which Melissa will be working with
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh is about another 1.7 and8 that's
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
almost $2.5 billion and then category
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
four of Transportation including federal
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
funds including Turnpike is about one
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
and a half uh so um HHS and education
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
your two biggest um sources uh
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
portions of the budget right now and
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
have been uh over the last uh decades uh
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
page 51 is fiscal committee statute the
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee is responsible as I
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to allow agencies after the
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
budget has passed to transfer to
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
transfer funds in between Class lines to
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
accept additional funds that maybe the
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
budget writers were not aware of uh
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant or other additional
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
funds over estimates needs to receive
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
legislative approval again from The
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
Authority designated to fiscal committee
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
to approve that and then the last uh
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
several Pages you can see all the money
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
over the last few years that have come
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
in uh we keep track of that come in
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
through fiscal in a typical uh banian
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic we were probably about $150
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
to $200 million of uh Federal and other
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
funds came in through fiscal um with
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
arpa uh with car's act there were close
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
to a billion dollars in um funds that
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
came in outside of the budget process
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
process uh most recently you're close to
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh about $500 million a year in arpa
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
funds uh that were coming in outside of
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
the budget process the reason those came
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
in outside of the budget process your
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
arpa and caros funds is because it's not
 
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
an ongoing program it's not operating
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
expenses these are one-time uh expenses
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and Governor
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
decided it's best to keep them separate
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
just for when you're doing budget
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
comparisons you're not watching it go up
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
by 3 billion dollars and then back down
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
and wondering what happened this is a
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
one a point in time um one-time use of
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
these funds and that's what you'll three
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
actions just to uh wrap up I've I've
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
included a couple of pages examples of
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
what you'll see in the cafer uh there'll
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
be a surplus statement that will come
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
out an official audited Surplus
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
statement what we'll provide to the
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee is not an audited Surplus
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
statement it's a surplus statement for a
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget plan uh the CF rle also when
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's finalized provide you a great
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
10-year history of fund balances for the
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
general education fishing game and all
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the other funds it'll provide you with a
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
history of employees uh representative
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
wer mentioned paychecks over the last 12
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
months that are issued uh the caer will
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
also provide you with a 10-year look
 
01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
back a number of employees uh by
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
agencies that each division kind of see
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
the trend or or or what's growing um and
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
then I just left put a couple of
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
examples of what are we going to provide
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
the divisions we provide uh we'll help
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
draft uh amendments that are necessary
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
to H Bill one or two will keep track of
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
the financial uh changes that each
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
division is making um work with your
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
analysts in your Division and come up
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
with a format that you think will be
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
most helpful for your division um and we
 
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
can prepare anything you need and then
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh finally we'll do a detail Change
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
Report to kind of provide a similar to
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the compare Report with a little more
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
description of what's going to happen or
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
what was behind some of the decisions um
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know just so the public may see a
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
reduction of $100,000 but it doesn't
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
tell you anything we like to do a detail
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
change document which is an example um I
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
think there's on page 91 near the end of
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
kind of what we like to provide uh out
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
to the public um and that's kind of the
 
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
to the public um and that's kind of the
process

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be a tough budget and I
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
I think everything you've heard over the
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
last week everything you've it's going
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
to be a tough budget but
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
um it's there are no easy ones even the
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
ones with significant there were no easy
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
budgets I think ask representative wer
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
and ask representative Wallner if
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
they've ever seen an easy budget the
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
answer will probably be no for for many
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
different reasons um but you do have a
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
great staff Financial staff out in the
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
agencies that will assist you and
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
provide you any information you need uh
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
our staff is there to help coordinate
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
that and get that for you and put it in
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
a format uh that is uh that will be most
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
helpful to you so we're here for you and
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to working with
 
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
you over the next several weeks thank
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
you and uh the work we've had from from
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
the LBA is is the only thing that
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
enabled us to do our job these These are
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
people are very good at this we'll sit
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
there all day doing stuff and then we'll
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
go home home at 4 or 5:00 at night and
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
the next morning we're ready to start
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
again they've been up all night making
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
sure everything that we we did during
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
that negotiation got put in a format
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we can look at the next day and say
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
okay otherwise one of us would be up all
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
night doing that stuff so got to hand it
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
to them they don't take vacations during
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
the budget time they maybe have a little
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
time off later on in the year one of the
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
other things that that came to mind when
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
I did the paycheck count there were
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
there are things that come before fiscal
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
that will be a um a temporary thing and
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions we might ask
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
where we see a change in in uh paychecks
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
that lasts for a period uh was there a a
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
grant that gave you this because those
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
people would still be in that department
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
and they would still be getting
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
paychecks that wouldn't deduct the ones
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
that were ontemporary or there as a
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
result so if we if we do see some
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
numbers like that follow on question is
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
are there any um grants that have
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
expired because along when when we do
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
approve those those um grants at fiscal
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
and five of us here are on fiscal and
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
couple others that are alternates so
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
when we do see a grant go come in and
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
it'll say We'll hire these people and
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
it'll say in the fine print that when
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
they when the grant expires the jobs go
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
away so we have to ensure that that in
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
fact happens and see so one of the
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
things as we look at paychecks is how
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
many grants have expired during this 12
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
months and see if in fact the jobs went
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
away so just something that came to me
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
as we were having this discussion that I
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
hadn't mentioned earlier so any further
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
LBA representative Edwards uh thank you
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I just want to uh share a
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more of my experience with
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
working with LBA with specifically with
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple the last two terms and um and
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
this may be I'm saying this because I
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
think it's beneficial as an orientation
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
issue um uh I I have found uh Mr Ripple
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh extremely capable of talking um to
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
the uh Democrats and to the Republicans
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
about what uh kind of analysis we want
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
to have done and what sort of
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
information we need so that we can have
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
a debate and committee and uh and he's
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
exceptionally trustworthy and I'm sure
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
that's true of all the lbas to maintain
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
discretion so that the members are the
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
ones controlling the information and
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
controlling the debate and so I think
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
that discretion is extremely honorable
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and useful for the effective functioning
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
of the Committees I appreciate that um
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
also uh when we take up bills um and we
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
have have um some amendments that we
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
would like to debate and consider um Mr
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
Ripple uh is exceptionally good at
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
working with OSS to get the Amendments
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
turned around and that's a that's a
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
vital function for us to get those
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
things done quickly and correctly so I I
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
I I just want to point that out as a as
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
an LBA service that I don't think you
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
you headlined today but but it's vital
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I also think that um the fact
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
that our LBA works with the house side
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
of finance and the Senate side of
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
finance and while he uh the that
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
discretion that I talked about is
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
maintained I think the situational
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
awareness of what the Senate is thinking
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
and talking about is uh is extremely
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
useful to us too so so there there are
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
many more layers to how great I think
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
the LBA is and and we simply uh you know
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
from my perspective we we could not do
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
this job without the LBA it's it's vital
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
they're vital team members and um and I
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
just appreciate the four years of having
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
worked with them so uh thank you I hope
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
that was useful thank
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman so um there
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
are some cases in the budget of double
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
counting particularly for the best
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
example is probably doit right because
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
one agency uh puts in their budget we're
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
spending so much on uh Information
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
Technology then doit gets that money as
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
income and then spends it on salaries
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
and so on so how do we how do we sort of
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
find these kind of numbers and when we
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
see things like your big pie chart do
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
that include double counting or is it
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
already taken out
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
somehow uh thank you representative so
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh the pie charts are gross so it's
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
everything double counting and
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
everything uh but as far as um how much
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
double counting there is between
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
transfers because both the sending
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
agency and the spending agency need to
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
have that authority to actually make
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
those expenditures on page 26 of of this
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
document it um which was this was just
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
added probably about um three budgets
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
ago if you look at the totals you can
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
see that uh the total funds uh they have
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the various sources the total funds
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
about 7.4 billion in 24 7.6 billion in
 
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.590 align:start position:0%
about 7.4 billion in 24 7.6 billion in
in

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
25 less funds for Budget Revenue
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
transfers other funds about $289 million
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's the double counting in 24 and
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
about 289 290 in 25 and so in total the
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
budget is closer to a 14 if you take out
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the double counting is closer to a 145
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
every accounting unit that has a
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
transfer uh to another agency or
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
receives a transfer from another agency
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
you will see that line less funds from
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
budgeted Revenue transfers so as you go
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
through the budget you'll see the total
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
the gross total plus the net total after
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
you get rid of the transfers so you'll
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
be able to monitor that for every
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
you okay here we are drinking from a
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
fire hose any further questions
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Mo thank you very much Mr
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Kane for all you
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
do I'm glad to see on page 90 you have
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
an example of an appropriation bill and
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
there's curious language that repeatedly
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
comes up that I thought maybe you could
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
just give some insight to and let us
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
know how often it happens and that
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
appears on lines seven and 8 on page 90
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
the governor authorized to draw a
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
warrant a very little discussion ever
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
occurs with regards to that line but we
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
see it over and over could you expand on
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
that and let us know how often that
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
occurs thank you sure thank you
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney um any general
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh through a a section requires that
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
language it has to the government needs
 
01:27:00.639 --> 01:27:02.030 align:start position:0%
language it has to the government needs
the

01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
um the the authorization from the
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to draw a warrant it's
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
obviously up to the governor legislature
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
can't force the governor do anything so
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
the languages May draw a warrant uh what
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
a warrant is is an authorization from
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
the governor that he provides in a
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
letter to the Department of
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services that sets up
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit uh you'll only see
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
that if you do see that language in that
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that's a general fund uh that's
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to be hit on the general fund uh
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
Department if it was a highway fund
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation it says shall be a charge
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
against the highway fund fishing game
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
Etc uh so that warrant language is
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
required and as we're looking at any
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill that's being introduced the 1100
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
bills uh we're looking for draw warrant
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
because that means that's a general fund
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the necessary language for
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
the governor to actually provide that
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
letter to Department of administrative
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
services to draw that money from the
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
general fund and they do have that
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
warrant Authority in the beginning of
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
house bill one for the major House Bill
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
one but any appropriation in House Bill
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
2 from the general fund needs that
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
language and that's something we'll
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
check to make sure it's there
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
