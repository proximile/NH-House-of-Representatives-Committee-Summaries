00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
hey yes sir this proposal makes changes
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
to the licensing rules for these types
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
of practitioners
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of issues to bring to
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
the committee's attention
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
the first one is on page 10 of the
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
linked pdf
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's a comment regarding the fact
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
that the rules have been expired since
 
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
that the rules have been expired since
2018.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
authority for the
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
administration of these professions
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
transferred from the department of
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
to the oplc in 2015 and like i said the
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
rules expired
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
are get transferred in 2015 and the
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since 2018. so
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
the committee may have some questions
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
about how licensing applications and
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
fees have been handled during that um
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
time period
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
um if you want i can go ahead and go
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
through uh the remaining comments or we
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
good morning lindsey courney executive
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
director office of professional ace
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
insurance certification
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think as the committee is no doubt
 
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
i think as the committee is no doubt
aware

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
the oplc has had some deficiencies in
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
the rule making process
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
that i think we've corrected with the
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
addition of staff and trying to
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
establish internal controls which
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
is why we were able to promulgate rules
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
for reflexology recently through this
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
proposal i will say i think there's
 
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
proposal i will say i think there's
about

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
about
60

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
60
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
licensed reflexologists
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of recent applications
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
that we've received that we have
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
attempted to enforce rules obviously
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
without rules in place those are not
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
enforceable so we would just adhere to
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you mr chair uh do you
 
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you mr chair uh do you
haven't

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
could you report on how many rules
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
expired rules you're suffering under at
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have a tracking sheet in place
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
and tina can correct me if i'm wrong um
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty up-to-date right now
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of rules for various
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
boards slated to expire in june but i
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
think they are um
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
they are underway
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
with regards to expired rules we do have
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
a couple of boards that have expired
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
rules that we're working on to get
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
before jail car as soon as possible and
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're working with the boards as quickly
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
well one of the concerns that that uh
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
those senior members of gelcar have and
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire and i and senator
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
reagan uh have
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
worked diligently to make the agencies
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
aware that their expired rules are not
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
rules they don't mean anything uh
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruled that way and then
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
there was a statute passed about what
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
six years ago or so to
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
make the stains same statement in
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
statute that they we can't be having
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
situations with expired rules out there
 
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
situations with expired rules out there
so

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
we are very concerned about what has
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
happened i hear this about since 2018
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and so we're very concerned about
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
what has been going on with those with
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
those uh agencies and and departments
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
that have expired rules
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i i completely
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
share your concern and i will give you
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
an example something that came up
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
recently with the vet board um the vet
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
board has been working on rules since it
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
was transferred from agriculture
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
back in i think 2018 when i first came
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
on board
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
they had a rule making proposal in
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
process never finished it in part
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
because i think they couldn't make any
 
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
because i think they couldn't make any
decisions

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so therefore their rules expired
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
related to continuing education we had
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
advised them very recently that they
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't enforce those continuing
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
education requirements which they're
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i understand a proposal is before
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
you but part of the issue is that while
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
oplc can provide administrative support
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
which obviously has been deficient in
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
the past we cannot require the boards to
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
make decisions and we cannot require
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
them to convene a quorum to actually
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
move the rules forward
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
reflex reflexology is different because
 
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
reflex reflexology is different because
it's

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
an advisory board and it absolutely
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
should have been done sooner than than
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
today but um
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
but i do think that we've made the
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
necessary corrections in in internally
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that doesn't happen
 
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that doesn't happen
again

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
so now is the time of year to start
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
the next issue to bring to your
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
attention is on page 13 of the linked
 
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.629 align:start position:0%
attention is on page 13 of the linked

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
pdf
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a note regarding the fact
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the oplc has filed some rulemaking
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
to address fees in a plc 1002
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
you rain you may recall that um this
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
issue has come up previously
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
that um some of the rules some of the
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
board rules have been citing to
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
non-existent fees at plc1002 and so this
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
was just to let you know that um the
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
oplc has filed rulemaking to address
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
the next issue is on page 15 of the link
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
pdf and it's a minor editorial issue
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's just where the forms and the rule
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
texts aren't really lining up
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
like i said they're very minor
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
the form says mailing address whereas
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
the rule text says billing address
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
and there's just a minor difference in
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
the attestation where
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
here in the rural texas says rules but
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
on the form it says regulation
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
so um and then finally there is uh one
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
more issue on page 19 of the linked pdf
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
just scrolling down there
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
this one is around the cap
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
so there is um
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
this is about the fees and the fines the
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
statute has a cap of two thousand
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
dollars and some of these fines would
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
hit that cap during the first month of
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
non-compliance uh the rule doesn't talk
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
about the um doesn't address this
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
concern at all doesn't talk about the
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
cap so this could be fixed by having
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
some language in the rule that clearly
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
states that there is a two thousand
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
dollar cap
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
um other than that those are the
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think that the
 
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think that the
clarifying

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
clarifying
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
statutory limit of two thousand dollars
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
you could even put that up under under d
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
as part of the top
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh heading for the whole find schedule
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
in fact i would move that we
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve it provided that
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's out and said the semicolon
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
say come up to a limit of two thousand
 
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
say come up to a limit of two thousand
dollars

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
or not to exceed two thousand not to
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
has has no objection to that
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
motion for approval by mcguire second by
 
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.990 align:start position:0%
motion for approval by mcguire second by
gray

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
gray
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye aye
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the rule carries
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay so this proposal makes changes to
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
the standards of practice for
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacists pharmacies manufacturers and
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
distributors licensed by the board
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
this item was postponed from the
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
previous meeting
 
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.029 align:start position:0%
previous meeting
and

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
that was to allow
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
the oplc to work with the board on a
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and one has
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
been filed and it does address the
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the issues
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are a few still left to discuss
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
the first one begins on page
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
5 of the linked pdf
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's a note here down at the bottom
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the page
 
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
of the page
that

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
there's a large section here that's
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
being repealed
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
i have i don't think that they've
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
entered into any rule making um
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
to put this
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know section somewhere else in
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
another pharmacy rule
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
but this was to bring to your attention
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and because once repealed
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
that section can't be enforced and so
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
the committee may have some questions
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
about the reasons and intent behind
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
repealing this section
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
um i can move on to the other ones if
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
you like
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next one i'll just scroll
 
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:41.350 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next one i'll just scroll
down

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is on page um
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
10 of the linked pdf and here this is
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
just a clarity issue
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
the website there doesn't actually have
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
the control drug loss form
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why the comment is there
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's also a note down at the bottom
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the page to let you know that the
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
agency deleted a section on autumn
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
automated data processing systems but
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
that section is now part of another rule
 
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.029 align:start position:0%
that section is now part of another rule
making

00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
the last issue involves comments
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
and on page
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
i believe 20 of the linked pdf
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
and what this is about is that the rule
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
says that um permit holders need to have
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
a current
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
written break policy for when the
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge goes on break
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the statute also requires that there
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
be rules in place to en
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
around that issue
 
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.590 align:start position:0%
around that issue
um

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
to specifically have a policy for the
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
super supervision of interns as well as
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
policy and procedures for when a
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacist goes on break but the
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
proposal has repealed that section
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not entirely clear why that's
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
being repealed or whether or not that's
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
going to be part of
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
another rule making uh to address that
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement and
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm tina kelly with the
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
certification

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
so to address the first issue on page
 
00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:13.110 align:start position:0%
so to address the first issue on page
four

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
um the repeal of the larger section
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
that those rules are actually been moved
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
to institutional pharmacy practices
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
under ph 2300
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that has been
 
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.630 align:start position:0%
and that has been
adopted

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
so everything from area sinks water size
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
of facility all of that is addressed
 
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.669 align:start position:0%
of facility all of that is addressed
there

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
on page on the next one is the issue of
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the website the form will be put on the
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
website as soon as it's approved and the
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
board adopts these rules because it i'm
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.789 align:start position:0%
not sure
with

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
the first forms but we're trying to get
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
all the forms into rule know that those
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are being used so the
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
one that you've got is the one that will
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
the next um one is um
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh supervision of interns and breaks
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is all addressed in ph 303.02
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
what the pharmacy board is trying to do
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the changes to all of these roles
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
was to move things into different places
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
address things in the appropriate areas
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
so that is why you're seeing entire
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
sections being removed put other places
 
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
sections being removed put other places
um

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to address
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
most of the time these rules were old so
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
they addressed pretty much sole
 
00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.310 align:start position:0%
they addressed pretty much sole
proprietors

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
proprietors
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
now we have a lot of ins
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
corporations and that type so they're
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
trying to make these more inclusive so
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
anybody whether it's a sole proprietor
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
or a corporation can all follow the same
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
set of rules
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the goal but that is addressed
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
all good
 
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
all good
motion

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh we had a situation four or five years
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
ago uh which um
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think you're probably aware of tinder
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
you've been around that longer than that
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
even uh with regard to breaks especially
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
for chain pharmacists uh and
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
we know we had a lot of testimony with
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
regard to error rate going up uh the
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
longer people don't have a break
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
especially a lunch break and people
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
working sometimes 12 and 13 hours with
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
no breaks
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
and that was you know the pharmacy board
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
was trying to do something about that
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of pushback of whether
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
they had the statutory authority whether
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
the you know pharmacy board did or not
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
so what is the current situation there
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
so i believe under 303.02 which i do not
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
have in front of me so i'm i'm speaking
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
from what i've talking to the board
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
member yesterday
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
was that those types of things are
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
addressed there so that there are
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
limits on the amount of hours a
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist can work without a break or
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
um and things like that that's all in
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
303.02 so
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
even though it's been removed from here
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
it has been put into another section
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm okay yeah yeah okay you're still on
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
your microphone's stolen
 
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
your microphone's stolen
sorry

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes yes um i see that in 70301 it does
 
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.630 align:start position:0%
yes yes um i see that in 70301 it does
require

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
eight no
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
arrests every no more than eight hours
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
compatible with stricter than or less
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
strict than the rules in
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
um i believe they stayed tried to stay
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
consistent put in but put it in areas
 
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
consistent put in but put it in areas
where

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
it would be more applicable and without
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
looking back in that i
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
can't give you a different definitive
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
answer okay
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me um tina you said it was in 303
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's what the board member
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
that i spoke to yesterday yeah i don't
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
see it and i've looked in our database
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not seeing any recent
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
rule making around the issue so
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
tina when was the other one adopted
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure of like i said i i
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
talked the board members do a lot of
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
their drafting so i talked to one of the
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
board members yesterday who provided me
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
with the information as i brought it up
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
we can look that up and and find you the
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
answer and give you a comparison of the
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
two rules
 
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
two rules
okay

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
fine i i moved to approve the rule
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
with the proviso that the
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
agency and the staff confirm that this
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
is compatible with other rules
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
second okay motion by mcguire second by
 
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
second okay motion by mcguire second by
schmidt

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye aye
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay um this proposal makes changes to
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
the rules for licensing of occupational
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
therapists and the proposal was
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
postponed from the last meeting because
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
the rule contains a citation to an
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
allied health rule for the fees
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
but the allied health role indicates
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the introductory section of that
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
rule that the schedule of
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
fees is for speech-language pathologists
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
and not for all allied health
 
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.789 align:start position:0%
and not for all allied health
professions

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:11.669 align:start position:0%
professions
so

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
because the issue has come up several
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
times the committee wanted to postpone
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
oplc to work with the board to find out
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not the board intended into
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
to enter into rulemaking to address that
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
so the board of directors of the office
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
of licensed allied health professionals
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
met on
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
5 12
 
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.230 align:start position:0%
5 12
and

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
i gave them proposed language to list
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
all of the boards within allied health
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
so that was very clear that the
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
fees applied to all the boards and they
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
have approved that
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
um there is one other fee that they
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to wait and that's that's
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
something completely different
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
and it's pending the addition of sp
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
hearing care providers so we just have
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
to get that on that one rule um
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
one fee the approval of the speech board
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
once that's done i'll be filing rule
 
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
once that's done i'll be filing rule
making

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's everything that's everything sir
 
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.830 align:start position:0%
that's everything that's everything sir

move to approve
 
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
move to approve
that

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
occurred that was a conditional approval
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is passenger tramway's safety rules
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
um there are several clarity and
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comments mainly with
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
regards to the forums mentioned in the
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
rules because they've not been filed yet
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the committee staff for review
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
and there was a issue
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
there was an issue
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
brought to the committee staff attention
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
after the comments were finished
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the possible creation of
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
licenses which may cause a lack of
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
authority comment um however um
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
i believe the agency is prepared to take
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
a preliminary objection so that we can
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
have time to work these issues out
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
fine in that case i move to object to
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
the rule on the grounds that it
 
00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
the rule on the grounds that it
creates

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
creates
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
actually two new licenses at least i'm
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
not sure there's if there's more but
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are at least two new licenses that
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
are defined in the rule
 
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.190 align:start position:0%
are defined in the rule
second

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
so your um objection would be based on
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
staff comments and on the possible lack
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
of authority for the licenses
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes 541a requires explicit authority to
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
create a license
 
00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:01.029 align:start position:0%
create a license
and

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they have it
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
no i was just asking if you wanted to
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion in a second
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
are you clear on
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
sorry good good morning my name is march
 
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.350 align:start position:0%
sorry good good morning my name is march
multiyani

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
multiyani
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
i've been working with the passenger
 
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:32.990 align:start position:0%
tramway safety board
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.630 align:start position:0%
tramway safety board
[Music]

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
with their rule making
 
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.590 align:start position:0%
with their rule making
um

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
the forms we did provide to ols and i
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of the comments we can
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
address the board is next meeting in
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
june so i believe that most of the staff
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
comments can be addressed satisfactorily
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
to the board with regards to the most
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
we don't i don't believe that we
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree that the board is
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
creating a license because the
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
board is given the authority to
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate the the standards in order
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
to regulate the ski
 
00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.230 align:start position:0%
to regulate the ski
areas

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
the board has incorporated by reference
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
the ansi standard
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
which you have in your meeting packet
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
which does
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
um reference the qualified wire
 
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
um reference the qualified wire
inspectors

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.549 align:start position:0%
inspectors
um

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm not sure that we'll be
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
able to address it satisfactorily to to
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
the committee but we might be able to
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
i would i have to agree with the agency
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
martyrs correct it's unclear if there is
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
a license to to committee staff as well
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
but the preliminary objection will give
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
us time to to look into that and
 
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
us time to to look into that and
determine

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
if if it you know explain the situation
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
to you and make sure that there isn't a
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
license being created if you look at the
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of page seven it says qualified
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
wire rope inspector means an individual
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
who is acceptable to the board to
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
inspect wire ropes that says that any
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
person who is inspecting wire ropes
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
must be given
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
approval by the board
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to say that it's a person
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
who is
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
has been qualified
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
according to
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
federal standards or national or
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
national sin that's something different
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
but you're changing from the
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
owner of the wire as picking somebody to
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
do the inspection to saying that the
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
board has to approve
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
such a person and that means it's a
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
license yes i agree the um
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
the rule does incorporate some some i
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
believe it's federal
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
information and the statute is quite
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
vague so um
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
i that's what i'm saying i need some
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
more time to
 
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
more time to
to

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
look through that so i can explain it
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
better okay
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
i'm agreeable with that
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%

speaking about but um
 
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.909 align:start position:0%
speaking about but um
the

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
the standard that we've adopted for
 
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.190 align:start position:0%
the standard that we've adopted for
years

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
a a y rope expert
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
inspects the wire ropes annually and
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
since the beginning
 
00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
since the beginning
when

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first
 
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first
made

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
had an rsa that was passed in 1960
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire is required
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
that the person who claims to be an
 
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.669 align:start position:0%
that the person who claims to be an
expert

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
expert
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
shall submit their credentials to the
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
board and the board would approve them
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
and put them on a list so that as far as
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
i know there hasn't been any change to
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
to the way
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
since the early days before my time so i
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
think what i'm not sure i understand
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
what the question is
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
procedurally but i think it nothing
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
seems to in my view has changed we still
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
require that if a person wants to be
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
considered an expert to inspect wire
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
ropes in new hampshire they submit their
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
credentials the tramway board reviews
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
them approves them and puts them on a
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
list and who issues the credentials
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
the person brings those uh there's a
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
list of requirements in our rules that
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
say if you
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the board shall approve them if they
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
bring in if you've got i know the rules
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
in front of me the
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
two five years experience or there's a
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
so many inspections completed uh how
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
many years experience a letter of
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a wire rope
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer a person brings those to
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
the board reviews them and says yep you
 
00:34:59.119 --> 00:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
the board reviews them and says yep you
you're

00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.829 align:start position:0%
you're
on

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
mike

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
in 1985 and 86 i was a legal intern at
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and reviewed
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
rules in including passenger tramway and
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i believe at that time 541a did not
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly require that every license be
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
statutorily authorized i believe you're
 
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:36.230 align:start position:0%
statutorily authorized i believe you're
correct

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes it seems like we've defined the
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
issue and with the preliminary objection
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's time for the
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
department to take action during
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
the period of time until this comes up
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay in the interim
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody that even issues
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
a license
 
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.230 align:start position:0%
a license
to

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's no other entity that i know of
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh we could do it ourselves as a state
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think well that's what we're
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
questioning if we need to establish the
 
00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
questioning if we need to establish the
license

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.150 align:start position:0%
okay okay
so

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
you have a motion for preliminary
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
objection and i believe there was a
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
second although i don't know who the
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
second was it was representative lange
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion
 
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:52.870 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion
edith

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that as we're
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
looking at these we are aware that there
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
are more tramways now unless
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is defined as at cannon mountain
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
there seem to be
 
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.310 align:start position:0%
there seem to be
trams

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
trams
 
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
trams
at

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
omni mount washington other places right
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think that total no we're talking
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
about all ski lifts when we tall tramway
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
so all ski lifts right so the number is
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
pretty stable you know um
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's construction seasons like this
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
one that are um pretty busy
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
if you looked at it over a long period
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
of time i think
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
we we aren't seeing a big increase but
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's 175 or so
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
of them right now it's been that way for
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
a while
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay you've heard the discussion all
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
all right this rule is an interim rule
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
regarding ems letters of concern
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it was filed as a result of chapter
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
205 of the laws of 2021 which allows the
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
commission the commissioner excuse me to
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
issue a letter of concern in lieu of a
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
license suspension
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
um the only
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
substantive comment is on page four of
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
the rule text
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that the text states
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
that a suspension may be deferred or may
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
be rescinded and this language allows
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
for oral rule making
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of criteria for when
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
these would or would not happen
 
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.069 align:start position:0%
these would or would not happen
however

00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
even though the court current language
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
is unclear um
 
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.870 align:start position:0%
is unclear um
and

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
causes a legislative intent issue this
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
is an interim rule and so these issues
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
issues could be fixed when the agency
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
goes to regular rulemaking
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
that process because interim rules only
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
motion by laying second by mcguire to
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
approve the interim rule
 
00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
approve the interim rule
discussion

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor aye any
 
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:12.069 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor aye any
opposed

00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay so this is air related standards
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
for new and modified facilities for air
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
pollutants the proposal makes changes to
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the rules for those standards and it
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
impacts municipal solid waste landfills
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
there is a one issue to discuss
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
which you'll see on the top of the page
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
on page seven of the linked pdf
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
the state has a delegation agreement
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
with the apa and the rule is being
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
updated to incorporate new and revised
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
epa standards palmergated since 2017.
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
there should be also a linked
 
00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:55.829 align:start position:0%
there should be also a linked
agency

00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
response to comments and in that
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
document the agency states that the
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
standards are already in place
 
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.670 align:start position:0%
standards are already in place
and

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
essentially that
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're already in effect and so the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
proposal doesn't impose any new
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirements on any existing sources in
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the issue and
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
the department you know may be able to
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
explain that a little more
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i i find it disingenuous of
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
the agency to say that we've been
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
incorporating these standards for the
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
last two years and therefore it's not a
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
new requirement it's a new requirement
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
since the last time the rules were
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
updated if i understand you correctly
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's a new requirement
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
like i said i think that the agency can
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
explain a little more my understanding
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
is that um it's uh already a standard
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the standards were already
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
industry-wide but like i said pam monroe
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
is here and can probably answer your
 
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:56.710 align:start position:0%
is here and can probably answer your
questions

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
pam monroe for environmental services
 
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
pam monroe for environmental services
so

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
what happens is epa promulgates these
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
what are called the mission guidelines
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the the 2014 date is is the
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
date of the promulgation and so any
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
source that is
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
is in existence at that time is an
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
existing source
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
then there's a process by which the
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
the epa promulgates a federal plan
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
the federal plan then makes those
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
emission guidelines enforceable
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
that federal plan was litigated at the
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
and it went into effect in june of 2021
 
00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:40.390 align:start position:0%
and it went into effect in june of 2021
so

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
in order for the department now so the
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
existing sources are subject to the
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
federal requirements now the department
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
has always taken the approach that
 
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
has always taken the approach that
we

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to regulate new hampshire sources
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
instead of them having to deal with epa
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
so the plan went into effect in june of
 
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
so the plan went into effect in june of
2021

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
this action will incorporate by
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
reference the federal standards the
 
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.430 align:start position:0%

federal
um

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
the federal plan so that the state can
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
now enforce the requirements
 
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.710 align:start position:0%
now enforce the requirements
against

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire sources to work with
 
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.430 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire sources to work with
them

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
to comply with the standards
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
and i apologize if our papers weren't
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
clear enough on that
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
well if you want to say that the
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
it it's a new requirement in the rule if
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
you say it's due to the
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
federal requirements which you have
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
our constitution forbids us from just
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
casually adopting
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
federal rules or regulations that have
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
not been approved by
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the the legislature or its delegates
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
namely jail car so you can't just say to
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
everybody okay the fed
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's a new new federal um federal
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that everybody has to
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
has to agree to you have to come to it
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
with rulemaking and and it is
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the rule it's a new requirement
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why we're here
 
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why we're here
it's

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
this action so currently
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
these sources are subject to federal
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
requirements epa can enforce those
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
federal requirements against
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
sources in new hampshire that are
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
subject to them this action
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're coming before you to adopt those
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
standards so that the state
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
can enforce them you're correct we
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
cannot do that now
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%

excuse me
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request for
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
this proposal has eliminated all but one
 
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.430 align:start position:0%
this proposal has eliminated all but one
comment

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the comment appears on the last page
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
and deals with text on page 8 of the
 
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.589 align:start position:0%
and deals with text on page 8 of the
rule

00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's edie
 
00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.870 align:start position:0%
it's edie
1407.02

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
1407.02
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
a the text reads as follows says
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding ed 306 schools shall
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
accept at least one third and may accept
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
as much as 100 percent if approved by
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of the total number
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
of credits required for high school
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
graduation if requested by a student
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
pursuant to see below
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
now this some of you may remember has
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
come around before
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
2019 the gel car voted six to four
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
to do a final objection to what was then
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
2019 5 on the same rule
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
the objections were based on
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and uh
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
a lack of authority
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the board the jail car also
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
voted to do six to four voted for a
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
joint resolution which went
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh back to the senate
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify the authority of the board
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh that was senate uh joint resolution
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
one during the 2020 uh legislative
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
session it was voted ought to pass in
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
the senate and it was laid on the house
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the table in the house where it died
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
after that the
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
the agency was allowed to promulgate the
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
rule which they did over in
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
august of 2020 it was adopted over a
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
final objection which means that the
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
currently the burden of proof is on the
 
00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
currently the burden of proof is on the
board

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to establish that the part objected to
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
is within the authority delegated
 
00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
is within the authority delegated
um

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
at this time that final objection still
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
stands and as far as gel car staff knows
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
there have been no challenges um in a
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
court or um in any way of this uh rule
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
that was objected to and so
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
essentially it's the same the same
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
language and as i maintained the last
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
time this came around um
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
there may be an issue of lack of
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
authority and there may be an issue of
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that is up to the gel
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
card to determine
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um you can now at this time either
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary do a preliminary objection
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
issue a conditional approval if you have
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
specific language that you want to
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
change or you may vote to approve
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
the rule if you approve the rule this
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
would take away the final objection from
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
before and flip the burden of proof back
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
onto the plaintiff
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
which is what your objection and
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
approval does
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
so if the agency
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
would like to to discuss as well but i
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
know some of you remember this was the
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
same issue from before so if any if you
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions you want me to
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
explain more i can um because i know not
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
all of you were here last time mr chair
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
i i want to move a preliminary objection
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
because of the uh all the issues that
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
were just raised nothing has changed
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
since 2019 so
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
um i would i would you know be
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
interested to hear why nothing has
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
changed since 2019 but i want to move a
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
preliminary injection objection based on

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
and identifiers
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
great so
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
did you want me to respond to the
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
comments i wasn't sure if there was a
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
question specific question in there no i
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
just made the motion thank you yeah
 
00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:10.230 align:start position:0%
just made the motion thank you yeah
okay

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
so you heard the staff comments
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
is there a motion that you're responding
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
to or do you want me to respond
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
so i made the motion based on the fact
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
that what we have in front of us exactly
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same as what we saw in
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
2019 and you know the procedural
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
things that happened after that so i'm
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
curious even though there was a you know
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
a final objection and everything that
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
happened why there isn't anything
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
different about the rules that are
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so we made excuse me commissioner
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair we have a motion with no second
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
and without a second the motion dies
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
great so thank you so what has happened
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
since we um were here before jail car
 
00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:01.829 align:start position:0%
since we um were here before jail car
previously

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
is that we have implemented the program
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we now have 15 learn everywhere
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
programs that have been approved in the
 
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
programs that have been approved in the
state

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
and you have students who are engaging
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
in instructional materials in fact i was
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
on a phone call before i came in
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
of students who have completed a program
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire institutes of
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
science in order to
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
earn credits
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so we are moving forward with the
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
program as it is and as we began the
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
implementation of that program we saw
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
there were some technical fixes in the
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
rules that we wanted to do so we're
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
bringing this rule before the body for
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
we believe in the letter that was
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
package of information that we have
 
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
package of information that we have
addressed

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
the jail car concerns that have been
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
raised and you will notice that um
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
the gel cart attorneys were very precise
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
in their language i said there may have
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
been a concern we believe there is not
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
a constitutional problem there is not a
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
rule problem associated with this and
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask the jail car staff
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
if you believe that all the concerns
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
so my
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
purpose is not to make the determination
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
of a
judge

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
in a court of law so
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
i can say that there may be
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
a lack of authority and there may be
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
um issues of um legislative intent
 
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.630 align:start position:0%
um issues of um legislative intent
issues

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
but i cannot definitively
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
answer that it's it's up to the gel card
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
to determine that
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes thank you i'd
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
like to ask
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner if he has taken any
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
steps to obtain legislative
 
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
steps to obtain legislative
clarification

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
of this issue
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
um so there was a bill that was in the
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
house i don't know what the status of it
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
is right now that was continuing to
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
further clarify the legislation towards
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
i do know that representative ladd was
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification i
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what we're talking
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
about the issue resolve revolving that
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're discussing right now is basically
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not the board of education
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
has the authority to say that one third
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
of the credits shall be granted thr can
 
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:30.250 align:start position:0%
may be granted through
 
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.549 align:start position:0%
may be granted through
[Music]

00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
at a request of a student may be granted
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
towards graduation and whether or not
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
they have that authority if that
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
authority or granting credit solely and
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
strictly relies with amongst the school
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
board or school district is that my
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of this conversation
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct the
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
the issue was whether or not um the
 
00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
the issue was whether or not um the
board

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
could mandate
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
one-third be taken by
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
um be accepted by the
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
the schools because the statute
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
appears that it may have
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
separated out those those authorities um
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
part of it to the school board the
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
school boards and part of it to the the
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
agency the the board of education um and
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
that was the the question of where does
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
that line lie
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so we had addressed that issue and
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
we continue to assert that when you read
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
the statute where it talks about uh
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
relative to the approval of alternative
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
programs for granting credit leading to
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
graduation that
 
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.390 align:start position:0%
graduation that
that

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
ability to grant credit leading to
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
graduation does the best the authority
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the board as well the letter that was
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
laid out to you as well as the testimony
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
that was previously provided and
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislative history on this
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrates in fact that uh that was
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
the original intent of that bill and is
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
receiving further clarification through
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative process
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i um just going
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
back to jack carr's
 
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:02.230 align:start position:0%
back to jack carr's
staff

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
comments it's more than just the
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
authority if you look on um their
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
comments there's a a problem that they
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
have a a potential problem they think
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um it's contrary to legislative
 
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.030 align:start position:0%
that um it's contrary to legislative
intent

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.829 align:start position:0%
intent
um

00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh in two different ways so it's both um
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know i the my motion for preliminary
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
injunction is based on two different
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
potential bases i mean we only need one
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
and there are two here um the fact that
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
and there are two here um the fact that
the

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
authority was exceeded and that it's
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to legislative intent so we
 
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
contrary to legislative intent so we
have

00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
two out of the potential four bases in
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
fact we only need one so that's the
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
basis of my motion thank you
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
well so what i would tell you is that
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've uh responded to the other
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
objection as well i was responding to
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative lang's uh question
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
specifically but we have addressed both
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.790 --> 00:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
god yes i noticed that was house bill
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
1329 which was voted
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh on the consent unanimously by the
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
education committee to be killed because
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
the state board has rules
 
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.510 align:start position:0%
the state board has rules
which

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
says that they aren't going to yeah well
 
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.309 align:start position:0%
says that they aren't going to yeah well
that's

00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's the legislative intent we don't
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
need the law because we have rules which
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't notice it at the at
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
the time but it was
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh if i man
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate that you know the department's
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
position is that this the legislation is
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
clear and the intent is clear obviously
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we don't agree with the ols
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
staff on that point but i just want to
 
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.069 align:start position:0%
staff on that point but i just want to
read

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
the the language of rsa 193 e2a
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 5b
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
it says the state board of education
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules pursuant to rsa 541a
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the approval of alternative
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
programs for granting credit leading to
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
graduation so um i assume hearing that
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
the the reference to the state board has
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
rules might have been a reference to
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
that statutory authority that gives the
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
board the authority to do that
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
right and the original
 
00:55:11.359 --> 00:55:12.789 align:start position:0%
right and the original
confusion

00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
was because of the paragraph before that
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
and reading the language of the statute
 
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
and reading the language of the statute
together

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.069 align:start position:0%
together
again

00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
greater minds have differed over clearer
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion from senator
 
00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:32.549 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion from senator
whitley

00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
whitley
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
would you restate your your object
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair yup so i move a
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
preliminary injunction based on the
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
significant uh issues raised
 
00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
significant uh issues raised
by

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
the oll staff who as we all know are you
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
know the most conscientious
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
folks i believe in the state house and
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know i just want to say you know um
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
of course i you know i recognize that
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
students learn differently and but i
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
also think that it's important for
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
schools to
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know retain local control over what
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
learning counts um towards graduation
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
credit so
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully the department will work with
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
ols staff
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns that have been
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
raised you know
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's been ample time to to do that so
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully this this preliminary
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
objection based on two different bases
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
again there are four potential bases we
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
have two here so i do feel like it is
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
our obligation um under our authority
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
the gel cards authority under under the
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
statute to to issue this preliminary
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
injunction and let them you know work
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
together to get a product that really
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
works for everyone thanks further
 
00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:38.470 align:start position:0%
works for everyone thanks further

tim
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair again i think
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
section 5b is extremely clear when it
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
says the word shall adopt rules
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
relative the approval of alternative
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
programs for granting credit leading to
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
graduation so that clearly gives the
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
agency rulemaking authority to set some
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
parameters i think they were
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
conservative in choosing one-third as
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
the as the minimum standard so i i'm
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%

okay the motion fails mr chair
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
move to a proof
 
00:57:57.359 --> 00:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
move to a proof
second

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%

00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you i mean i think this
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
is doing a big disservice to the many
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the jail car staff i mean i
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
respect your analysis but i i would
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
always defer i'm a lawyer myself but
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
even in this case i would defer to our
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
our staff um
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
all lawyers all went to law school are
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
telling us there's problems so i'm
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
really sad to see this i think this
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
really uh interferes with the
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
credibility of gel car that we're doing
 
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.549 align:start position:0%
credibility of gel car that we're doing
this

00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.549 align:start position:0%
further discussion
later

00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that it has not been
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicated i think uh leaves the matter
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
up in the air in my mind as well
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that it hasn't been
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
challenged uh uh is you know
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.190 align:start position:0%
the the
the

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
senator whitley
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
annunciated a while back uh has merit in
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
this particular situation i think uh
 
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.349 align:start position:0%
this particular situation i think uh
because

00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the degree that there was an
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
objection to begin with
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
it has not been adjudicated leaves it up
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the air and i would have preferred if
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee uh sorry if the head board of
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
education had come back to us with
 
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.069 align:start position:0%
education had come back to us with
uh

00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
the department of education had come
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
back to us with some
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
recognition and and acceptance of that
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
and some change
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
so i think it's still leaves up in the
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
air and it has not been adjudicated so i
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it's resolved
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
and jacquard staff is a combat legal
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
authority uh i'm going to go with that
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes thank you i'm
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
agency apparently was
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
working with the chair of the education
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee to clarify this so that it's
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
not conflict
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they decided that it wasn't
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
necessary because it's in the rule and i
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
think we need to train our committee
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
chairs better so that they know that is
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
that the rule does not trump the law
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee staff is actually working on
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
some of those trainings
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
to do just that thank you

next month's meeting
 
01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.309 align:start position:0%
next month's meeting
okay

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
mike uh that was what i was going to
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
speak to uh for the newer committee
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
members traditionally gelcar has met on
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
fridays the third friday for the first
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
half of the year during session and then
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the third thursday the remainder of
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the year uh this year session is ending
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat early so
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
and there should not be many meetings in
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
june so there was interest in moving the
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
june meeting to thursday however since
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
the committee had voted on its schedule
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year i think it
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
second motion is to move the june
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
meeting from
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
friday to thursday
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll cancel the continued meeting
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that will make the next meeting on
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
