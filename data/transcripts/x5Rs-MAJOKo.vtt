Kevin avard representing District 12 and

I'm here today to introduce Senate bill
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
um 555 which strengthens annual
 
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements regarding
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical rebates and requires at
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
least 50% of the rebates to be shared
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
consumers I'd like to start off by
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
providing a brief history of this issue
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that the legislator has
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
recognized the importance of this in the
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
past in 20120 we re we enacted RSA 415
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
A7 which requires rebates to be shared
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
in one or both of the following ways one
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
providing direct directly provided
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
directly to covered persons at the point
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
of sale to reduce the out of-pocket
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
cost secondly retained by the insurer to
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
reduce premiums the statute also
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
requires insurers to file an annual
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
report with the insurance department to
 
00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.150 align:start position:0%
report with the insurance department to
verify

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
verify
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
compliance initial report from the
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department shows that insurers
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
are complying with the verification
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions by filing an
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
adapation but no details of proof of
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
compliance is part of that which is not
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
what the legislators contemplated when
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
they passed the law and acted and
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
additionally the statute sunsets July
 
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.110 align:start position:0%
additionally the statute sunsets July
1st

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
2024 Senate Bill 555 makes minor
 
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
modifications to the current law which
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
comes to us after discussion with the
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department the governor's
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
office this bill um provides uh New
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department with the
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
tools appropriately uh with the tools to
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately verify the rebates held by
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
the insurers and which are being red
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
which are to reduce the premiums and yet
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
as it is drafted to ensure that no
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
proprietary information is made to the
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
public in doing so additionally this
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislation requires that at least 50%
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the rebates that the insurance
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
companies or the PBM negotiates with the
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
drug manufacturers to lower the actual
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
price shall be shared with the patients
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy counter to help
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
consumers with they're out of pocket
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
expenses and why should consumers have
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
to uh why should have consumers have to
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
use the the list price when many of
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
these cases that are not in actual
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
company I would like to highlight that
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation also requires 50% which
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
in my belief is already a significant
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
compromise other states have adopted
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
laws requiring 100% of the rebates
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
shared at the counter and at least eight
 
00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
other states are considering similar
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
legislation this year however this
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
proposal strikes a balance of
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
controlling premiums and helping
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
patients with their needs in in the most
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
at most in the pharmacies when they are
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
faced with out of- pocket deductibles
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
and co-pays imposed by insurers New
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers are paying more of
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
their out of pockets uh because of the
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
actual drug prices is not being used
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
when the calculation takes
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
place I want to provide you with an
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
example of how this would work and why
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's so important for our constituents
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
take Francis for example she has
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes and a chronic respiratory
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
disease she's enrolled in high
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
deductible plan with co-ace for
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
medicines and once her deductible is
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
reached let's assume she takes the
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
medication with the list price of $200
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
but for which her health parent receives
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
a rebate of 100 without this bill during
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the deductible phrase Francis
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
will pay $200 of her medicine even
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
though her Health Plan only pays
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
$100 if this legislation passes at least
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
50% of the rebate received by Francis
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
Health Plan would have to pass to her
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
when she buys a prescription which would
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
save her
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
money I'm in houses every
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
week I clean for a
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
living I see rich people people and I
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
prescriptions sitting on the
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
counter and I'm sorry to interrupt my
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
own testimony but you know there was one
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%

asking for
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%

a result instead of paying the 200 for

her medicine she would pay no more than
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
150 and with the lower out- of- pocket
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost Francis may be more likely to take
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
her medicine prescribed by her doctor
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
potentially resulting in a better health
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
outcome and potentially avoiding
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits hospital
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
stays and other costly Services you'll
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
likely hear that the passing of the this
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will drastically increase
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
premiums and I'd like to point out to
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
West Virg that West Virginia whose law
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
also requires uh uh insurers and pbms to
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
share 100% of their savings uh they
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the medicine
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
directly to the patients in 2023
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
insurance rates finally indicate that
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
the premiums increased in West Virginia
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
are uh in line with national premium
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
increases in 2023 and did not
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase there is also um
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
Millan report which shows that in
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
Arkansas who also passed 100% that there
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
was no meaningful impact on
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
premiums again the proposal before you
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh allows the insurance of the pbms to
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
Ain 50% it's a
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
compromise of the savings of the premium
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
reductions and allows inure P of pbms
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
and of the higher percentage of savings
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
to reduce the premiums uh than uh than
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and Arkansas mandate you
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
may also hear about the rebates that a
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
pass through would be a difficult to
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
implement however it should be noted
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department filings
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
did require under current law Anthem
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
indicated that beginning in 200
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
21 they've implemented 100%
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
rebate in New
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they share it with their
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
consumers at the counter for uh uh for
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
their individual and small and large
 
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:44.069 align:start position:0%
their individual and small and large
group

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
markets for some reason this never came
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
to our our test our our Hearing in in
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
HHS not sure why but it wasn't there uh
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
but I think it's significant that there
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
are people that in New Hampshire that
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
are are getting it at 100% but there are
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
not and I'm a little excited because I
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
also know that there's there's a lot of
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
resistance to this
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
bill and I find that objectionable
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to put money back
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
pockets um I think this is a very
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
important bill I think this helps people
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
that are on fixed incomes who do not
 
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
that are on fixed incomes who do not
have

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
Anthem additionally when considering
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation the Senate adopted an
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
further uh in further consultant with
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
several departments to exempt Medicaid
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
Medicare management programs and the
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
Ryan White uh HIV AIDS program and
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans such as the state
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
employees health benefits these changes
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
would result in no fiscal impact and I
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
emphasize that because somebody handed
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
me a fiscal impact that said it was
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
going to be $30 million out of the
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
state's pocket it wasn't true and I take
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
great offense to
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
mind the New Hampshire legislature has
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to truly help Granite
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
Staters afford their medications where
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
they need it most at the counter where
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
we recognize that four years ago we
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
passed the current law uh and S sp555
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
will help extend improve the drug
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
affordability for thousands of our
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
constituents and I ask this committee to
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislation there are some very smart
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
people in this room that are going to be
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
talking to you that will have point and
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
Counterpoint I have to get back to
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
committee because I still have other
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
bills that we're we're uh trying to uh
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
exec so I'm going to ask you to hold
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
your questions and and answer have them
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
and I know the insurance Department's
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
here and uh and others so um I'm asking
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
you to pass this
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's a good bill I think
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
this puts a little bit of extra money
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
back into the pockets of people that I
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
them and I I know this would help them
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
that little bit will help
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
them and so with that God bless you all
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you Senator avard
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh if you have written testimony would
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
you mind giving it to the clerk just
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
passing it
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
you uh Senator Susi did you want to
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill and you support the
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
Susi I represent Senate District 18
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
comprised of the town of Lichfield and
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
five boards in the city of Manchester
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to repeat the points
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that Senator avard has already raised um
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
but I am a co-sponsor of the bill and I
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
do think that as complicated as many of
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical issues are this is
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
one of the few pieces of legislation
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
that's distinct and that provides direct
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
consumer savings um we've talked a lot
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
about the cost of insurance and the
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
effec of Pharmacy benefit managers on
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
the system and the process of retail but
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually at the point a
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
consumer makes um their purchase uh
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
would realize the savings for those
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
consumers and for that reason I support
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation um I'd be happy to
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
spear thank you for answering my
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
question we were given from the uh
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department their analysis it
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
was a 2023 December analysis of the
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
insurance Market Market mhm and on page
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
49 of that market it says that in that
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
without rebates premiums go up
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
approximately $40 per person per member
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
per month now in the previous testimony
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
we talked about impacts to people at the
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
at the counter
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
MH we have finally made a dent in New
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with respect to getting more
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
people insured than we ever have in the
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
previous years we didn't have Medicaid
 
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.470 align:start position:0%
previous years we didn't have Medicaid
expansion

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
the single biggest reason people say
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
that they are not insured is the cost of
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
premiums according to the insurance
 
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.830 align:start position:0%
premiums according to the insurance
department

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
analysis the costs for premiums are
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to go up $50 $40 a month so we're
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to be dropping people off the
 
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.430 align:start position:0%
going to be dropping people off the
insurance

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
roles in order to give this in order to
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
give the benefit
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
which many people there are ways to get
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
some of these benefits other ways
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
question i' admittedly oh my question is
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
this are you're right I should asked the
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
question part have you when in making
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill was any analysis done to see
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
what was going to how this was going to
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
impact the cost to the insurance base
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we have in this
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
state um thank you representative um I
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know I based um my testimony on the
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the fiscal note was
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
certainly what was considered when the
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was introduced uced um I I
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
think I would answer it in two parts as
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
well that when we're talking about this
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about every single
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
insured individual because as you know
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
the commercial Market is a segment um
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
there is Medicare there is Medicaid
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are different plans that are
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
self-run I'm sorry this analysis is only
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
on those groups that are covered by our
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
insurance department okay I I'm I'm
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
trying to answer your question
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative um so that that's the
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
first part of the question is that we're
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
looking at different segments of people
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
that are that are insured um the second
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
part that I would say to you is that
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
um there are major there is a major
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
insurer in this state that's already
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
giving 100% of the rebate so to suggest
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
that every premium is going to go up by
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
$40 um I don't agree with I I don't
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that's accurate that was not
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
information that was provided to us and
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
I just respectfully
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
disagree okay follow on follow
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I've talked to
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
Anthem and yes this year they do that
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean every year they will be
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
able to remember insurance companies are
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
regulated mhm 85% of the large market
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
and 40 and 80% of the small Market has
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
to go so my question
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
is I'm trying to put this in a in a
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
question format so my question is the
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
analysis has to be done over time and
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the analysis has come from the insurance
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
department it's not like we made it up I
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
mean this is official information that
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
we were given uh it's very difficult to
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
find the basis on which you are
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with it on so can you
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
explain that by representative as I said
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
that analysis was done after the fact I
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
did not get the opportunity to review
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
the analysis before I was here I'm told
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm basing my testimony upon the
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
information that we had at the time we
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
voted in the Senate I do recognize that
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
it's a snapshot in time but I would
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
suggest that analysis is probably an
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
analysis that's a snapshot in time I
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me so I I
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't think going back and forth I I'm
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to read 49 Pages
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
between now and um the time the next
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
person is able to testify but certainly
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look at it afterward I'd be
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
happy to all right any other questions
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you Mr thank you
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Senator welcome to
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
Congress nice to see you um your
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
constituency is a little bit similar I
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
think to some of senator avard in that
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
you have um some City constituents so I
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could speak to a a
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about the impact of
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
constituents who have uh multiple needs
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
for pharmaceuticals and prescriptions
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
and potentially as he
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
described uh high costs and scrimp and
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
save to pay for those and potentially
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to take their prescriptions every
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
other day or ration or just are unable
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
to comply with the prescription
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
orders and the longterm impact of going
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
off those prescriptions and the impact
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
on the health care costs
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
therefore thereby you know dealing with
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
the health problems caused by not being
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
on those prescriptions just say for
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
example uh a diabetic who goes off their
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
sugar management pills or injections or
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatever and then that drives higher
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare costs do you think that this
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill if it helps people stay on those
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
medications could that actually Drive
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare cost savings is that has
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
there been any discussion or talk about
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
that well that type of
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
issue thank you representative um the
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
issue of insulin is something that you
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
know we've dealt with here in the state
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
to reduce cost it's been dealt with at
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
the federal level but you are right many
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
of my constituents do have to make
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
choices of whether or not to pay a bill
 
00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:52.789 align:start position:0%
choices of whether or not to pay a bill
buy

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
buy
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
groceries pay for certain
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals that are costly there
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
are instances where people people are
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
making choices some of them for their
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
own health are bad choices because they
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
were prescribed medications that they
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
need to the extent that they're not
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
using them appropriately then you're
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
right there is a potential for greater
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
impact on cost um because it may create
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
more chronic conditions that lead to
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
other health care issues down the
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
road all right thank you looks like the
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
Chairman's back um I was going to call
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
Representative Leon next so I'll suggest
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
Senator good
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
morning good good morning for the record
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
I am representative Erica Lon
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
representing the town of dairy and uh
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
one time offered a position of providing
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
Wall Street an analysis over pbms uh
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
back in their early days I decided to
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
stay with medical implantable medical
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
devices because I thought those had a
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
larger net overall benefit to um to
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
society and to patients uh so looking at
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
this the whole intention of pbms and
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
these rebates is to be able to make sure
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
that when there are these choices the
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
the cost and the rebates are shared with
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
the people who are taking these
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
medications the cost of these drugs is
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly high and we discussed on
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
another bill the issue of Financial tox
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
toxicity if somebody's not able to
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
afford the medication that they should
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
be taken taking then that leads to worse
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes especially if they are taking a
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
lower dose or for goinging doses because
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're unable to pay for those
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
medications um drugs are expensive
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
because the approval process is
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
expensive but the process of having
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
rebates in order to help people pay for
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
their drugs is a good way to mitigate
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that it's absolutely
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
crucial that we pass this along to those
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
people who are taking these expensive
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
life-saving life improving or life
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
prolonging medications um so that the
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
cost to them is uh is mitigated as
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to having people within the
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
whole Healthcare ecosystem sort of suck
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
up those rebates instead of sending them
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
to the end users as they're intended so
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
um I I support this bill and uh with
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
that I'll take any questions but I I
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
have to say I haven't gotten quite as
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
deep into all those details of the
 
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
wording as uh the Senators so um keep me
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
at the surface for my questions please
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
buros hi representative thanks for
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know where
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
this disconnect may be between what
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative spear was talking about
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
that this will increase premiums and the
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate that said that that's not
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen do you have any insight
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
as to that um thank you for the question
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal node and how it
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
impacts Medicaid in Medicaid they use
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
that in order to offset the costs um we
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
may have insurers that are doing the
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
same thing but when you look at it um
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
individuals have individual needs and
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
right now the difference that you would
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
have on one of these private insurance
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
plans I'm really not sure I really don't
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
see how that would flow through to the
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
people who are the higher users of the
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care System who need these
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
expensive drugs in order to live or to
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
thrive and while that sort of spreads
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
the good amongst everybody these are the
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
people who have to pay this higher
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
co-pay and this higher out of pocket for
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
their need for the medication and to me
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to make sure that
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
those individuals are able to continue
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
um to afford and continue to take the
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
medication as prescribed um as opposed
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
to looking at the overall overall cost
 
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.789 align:start position:0%
to looking at the overall overall cost
of

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
insurance chairman
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
hun uh yes right representative Herbert
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
did ask before um you used the phrase uh
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
I think you said medical
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
toxicity and and and to me I immediately
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
said if that's if that's a real thing
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I suspect it is then what is the uh
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
are we holding
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
harmless those people who
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
are producing medical toxicity I mean is
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
it as if we're representing a a huge
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
constituency some are wealthy some are
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
not some are healthy some are not
 
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
and when you say something like that to
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
me that sounds to me as a uh a
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
litigation uh opportunity if the uh if
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
if some of the players here decide that
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
they want to or don't want to uh reduce
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
any prices or do any rebates U well
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I was
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
talking about financial toxicity not
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
MediCal toxicity because any drug has
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
has an overdose rate you can overdose on
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
drinking too much water um so there are
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
risks with any treatment um yeah because
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
it it it distills your electrolytes um
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
but when you look at that there's the
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
medical toxicity and the dose makes the
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
poison that's part of the risk that you
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
take when you're taking drugs the
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
financial toxicity is making sure is
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
helping to do what we can without
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
undermining the whole process of
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
bringing new drugs to Market to make
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
sure that people are able to afford the
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
medications they need because if you
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
were cutting your pills in half or only
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
taking them half as frequently um
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
because of that non-compliance with your
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication you will likely
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
have worse outcomes there's other people
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
that just don't do the treatments they
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
may not take um a medicine that deals
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
with their side effects because it's
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
more expensive and because they don't
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
take the drug that helps with their side
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
effects they can't treat their condition
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately so um the whole idea of
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
rebates was to be able to push some of
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
that back to those end users those
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
people who were taking these medications
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe that having this drive
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
that back through to where should be um
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
is is a good step from us um you can
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
never remove any potential litigation
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
from the world of medicine but I don't
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
see this creates any new or unique risk
 
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.350 align:start position:0%
see this creates any new or unique risk
for

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
spear I'm trying to form this in a form
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
of a question and I don't want to say
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
would you believe but
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
in investigating this which is in that
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
way that I typically
 
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.269 align:start position:0%
way that I typically
have

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
rebates are a negotiation carried on by
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
pbms on a volume
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
basis to be able to put insurance uh to
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to put drugs on a lower level
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
in a formulary it is not nothing to do
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
with patients it has to do with where it
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
is in the formulary so that the patients
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
can have a lower
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
co-pay but if we're going to be taking
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
that bulk of money that was negotiated
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
out at the risk now right now anybody
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
any drug company any I'm sorry insurance
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
company is allowed to put the rebates at
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
whatever level they want and use them
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
how they can feel with their business uh
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
plan in order to meet their legal
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirements if we force them into one
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
segment and if we give those rebates
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
take those rebates away from the C cost
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
of premiums aren't we also just throwing
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
more people off the insured
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
roles which has no benefit to anybody
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
and is a very bad impact on the state as
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the years do you
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
see do you not see that I don't know how
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
to ask this question no thank you it's
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
an incredibly complicated process and
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
it's one where the insurance companies
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
the drug companies and everybody else
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
involved are continually responding to
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and rules at both the
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
federal and state level there are a lot
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
of things that we have done here and
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
that we've done in the state and we have
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
done federally that make Insurance more
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
expensive than it needs to be so I'm
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
highly sensitive to all those times when
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
we do things that make exp Insurance
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
more expensive than it needs to be um
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we need to address those when you
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
look at the use of these rebates to put
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
it in a different tier on the formulary
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
um there is there is some argument that
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
if you have something that has a co-pay
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
for $10 instead of $20 or $20 instead of
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
$100 that that's in effect getting a
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
rebate uh because it's on a lower
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
formulary but the question becomes is
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
what is the discount that they are
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
getting from the drug manufacturers in
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
order to shift into that formulary
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
because there's a benefit to the drug
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
manufacturers as well to have those
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
volumes um when I was an analyst
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
covering companies I also we they some
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
of those companies were device companies
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
but they also had drugs so the more
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
consistent of sales that they had even
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
if it was a lower price price point is
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
rewarded by investors so there's a
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
benefit to those drug companies from
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
having those consistent sales even if
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
they are at a lower price point so that
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
helps them and the pbms there's the
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
benefit to them in order to capture as
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
much of the rebate as they can what I'm
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
looking at is you know my neighbor who's
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
going to the drug store and trying to
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
make sure that she can afford her
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
medication and making sure that she is
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
getting some of that rebate not just in
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
changing what tier it's in because
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
they're not required to change the tier
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
in order to pass it along but just to
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that those people whose lives
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
depend on expensive medications get some
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
of this because drugs are expensive
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
because it costs over a billion dollars
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
to bring a drug to Market um and a lot
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
of the other efforts in order to give
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
lower cost drugs to patients um some of
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
the Compassionate Care some of those
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
have been short circuited because the
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
way that that the Medicare and Medicaid
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
payments happen if you give drug to free
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
somebody then you're going to have to
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
give it to free to everybody on Medicaid
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
or on Medicare so it's highly complex
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
but I think that given even all the
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
complexity this is a way we can help the
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and I don't
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
think it's going to have a have a
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
premiums thank you very much thank you
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the chair will call in DJ beton Court
 
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
uh the chair will call in DJ beton Court
from

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
Insurance good morning Mr chairman
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee as you well
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
know by now my name is DJ bport and I
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of serving as the
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
insurance department I joined this
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
morning by Michelle Heaton the
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
Department's director of life and health
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be candid with you with the
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
exception of Senate Bill
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
173 no piece of legislation has absorbed
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
more of the Department's time and focus
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
than Senate Bill 555 not that we are
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
complaining we enjoy working on
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
significant legislation and we realize
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
that it is an important part of what we
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
do uh but the consequence of that is
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
that this will be some of the lengthier
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that I have provided to
 
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that I have provided to
this

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee so with that as it pertains to
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
where rebates should be applied be they
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
at point of sale or integrated into
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
premiums that is a policy decision for
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
decide as has been mentioned you're
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lot of competing
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and you will have
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
to determine what direction is best the
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
the only comment that I will make
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
because you are going to hear and in
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
fact you have already heard reference to
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
the Department's annual hearing report
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
that does touch upon prescription drug
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
rebates uh that uh piece of it of that
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
annual hearing was conducted by the
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm of oliv Oliver Wyman and
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
they reported that the Actuarial value
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
of prescription drug rebates in 2022 was
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
$38 per per member per month which
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
represented an 11.7% increase from
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
2021 the $34 expressed as a per capita
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
annual cost with that all equates to
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
$456 per person in 2022 up from
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
$48 in
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
2021 across commercially insured markets
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
the total value of rebates again
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
according to Oliver Wyman was estimated
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
to be approximately $90 million in
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
2022 so along that line of logic if this
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislation were to pass with the 50%
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
rebate at point of sale provision
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
approximately $45 million could
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be absorbed into premiums or
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
applied as upward pressure on
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
premiums now the question that has been
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
asked I'm sure the question that perhaps
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
is on your mind is is that likely to
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
happen and I have a wholly unsat
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
satisfying answer for you I don't know
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain how the commercial
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
Market will respond to the 50% rebate
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
remit requirement at the point of sale
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons why for example are a person
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
has a $15 co-pay for a drug that costs
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
$500 if the rebate on that specific
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
prescription is $400 the co-pay is still
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
$15 and even if the $15 co-pay is w CED
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
to reduce the outof pocket cost only $15
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be credited at point of sale
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
despite the $400 rebate beyond that we
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
do not know how the market will
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
implement the systems to guarantee the
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
50% rebate some may try to work around
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the requirement While others may choose
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
to eliminate rebates entirely
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
perspectives and opinions vary on that
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
point as you will hear and as you've
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
already heard uh but I just cannot tell
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
you with any certainty how exactly this
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
will play out as I have said how you
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
choose to proceed is your decision and
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
we will execute whatever decision you
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
make but because the actual anal
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
analysis was essentially work uh was
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
essentially Department work product I
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
did want to address it with all of that
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
said I am here to advocate for the
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the uh proposal before
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
you when the legislature established the
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
current Arrangement a few years ago the
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
department was tasked with collecting
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
reports from carriers on how things were
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
unfolding with rebates and premiums
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we discovered that those
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
reports the reports that we got and for
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
those of you who have gotten them and
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
have reviewed them I think would agree
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
that the law did not provide us with the
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
Authority or the tools necessary to get
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
get data uh that was of value that could
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
give us a comprehensive understand
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of how things were playing
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
out and frankly uh my team was a bit
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
frustrated that we lacked the ability to
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
provide something to you of high quality
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
we always try to do that when given a
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility or a charge from the
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislature so this amendment or the
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
proposal uh attempts to address that
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
issue by specifying more clearly the
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
data information and methodologies that
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
the carriers and pbms need to provide
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
the department so that we can adequately
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
report back to
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
you it strengthens our ability to
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
provide oversight to this important
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
segment of our healthc care delivery
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
system and this will better as I said
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
allow us to understand how things are
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
playing out and make public where
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to avoid disclosure of any
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
proprietary information a much more
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis to uh policy makers
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the public so we do support as I
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
said those transparency and
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
accountability provisions of the
 
00:39:55.319 --> 00:39:57.470 align:start position:0%
accountability provisions of the
proposal

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to sections D and E of The
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
Proposal those sections are related to
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
anti- steering initiatives that some
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
other states have created uh to prohibit
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
our position is that laws prohibiting
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
steering by pbms to their male order
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacies inhibit the economic benefits
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
integration in terms of what we would
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
suggest you to consider as you go
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward is to try to find a legislative
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
approach that balances the importance of
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
transparency with financial incentives
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
to promote efficiencies in prescription
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
drug delivery we believe that that can
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
produce the best result for
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
consumers finally I do want to address
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh a bit of a misunderstanding of sorts
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
U the claim has been made and I've heard
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
it in a couple of different forums that
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
wrote this bill I want to clarify that
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
this is not a department initiative uh
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
this was not something that we want
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to wait into as I said at the
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
outset we believe that this was a policy
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
decision for all of you to make now that
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
being said in the fall we were engaged
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office uh he was
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
conceptually thinking about uh trying to
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
bring some ideas and proposals forward
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
on this topic uh he asked us to put
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
together a proposal that would uh
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
reflect a 50% uh rebate at point of sale
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
we provided him with language as we
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
would do to any of you that asked for
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
our assistance uh but this was not an
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
initiative of the department as I said
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
we simply provided uh the governor's
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
office with functional language uh to
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
carry forward uh what it is that he
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to put before you for
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
consideration so I did want to clarify
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
that and with that said Michelle was
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
there anything you'd like to add that
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
I've missed no Michelle says no so I'm
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
happy to take your questions okay all
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I I read the report in quite a
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
bit of detail and I thought it was very
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
informative but one of the things that I
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
saw was that for the last three years
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
four in the report it keeps showing
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
rates going up little by little by
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
little by little so the pressure is
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
already there to raise
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
4.9% uh uninsured rate in this state
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
which is probably a record I don't know
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
you could answer that but it was down
 
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.710 align:start position:0%
you could answer that but it was down
from

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
6.1% a few years
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
ago do you envision that if rates hit a
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
certain point that people are going to
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
start dropping out of the
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
rols sure that's always a risk and that
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
is always something that we're very
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
sensitive to one of the biggest
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
roadblocks to Consumers being able to
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
get access to care is cost and it is why
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
this state and the federal government
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
have spent so much time and effort and
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
resources into trying to bring down
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
premiums particularly in our individual
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
Market I'm proud of the fact that the
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
state moved forward with a 1332 waiver a
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
few years ago that has helped bring uh
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
premiums down at individual Market
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
dramatically and the combined efforts of
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
the state and the federal government
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
have resulted in New Hampshire having
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
some of the lowest premiums in the
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
Northeast and I think that's something
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
that we can all be proud of uh so we are
 
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.710 align:start position:0%
that we can all be proud of uh so we are
sensitive

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
when we see proposals that could begin
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
to erode or undermine uh those efforts
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of why premiums are going up
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different reasons
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
for that uh it's the reason why you all
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
many years ago put it in statute that we
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
have to conduct an annual hearing every
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
year to disclose the analysis of what we
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
are seeing that is driving health care
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
costs and premiums we do that every fall
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh we encourage enourage all of you to
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
attend but if not those sessions are
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
recorded and you can take a look and
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just the Department's work
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
product we do bring in Actuarial experts
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh to do that analysis as well Michelle
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything to add uh the only
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
thing I'd add is in the individual
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
market with the um expanded subsidies
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
under the um arpa as well as our 1332
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
waiver from in 2020 we had about 45,000
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
in the individual Market as of March of
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
this year that's up to
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
76,000 so we've had've seen large growth
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
in our individual market and as the
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we have the some of
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
the lowest premiums in the individual
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
Market in the country not just the
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast so I think um there's a lot of
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
different factors he said that can
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to premium growth but right
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
now we have some of the lowest premiums
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the country and we have um record
 
00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh we do have
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have a I have a question
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner uh I don't know
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
if it's a Germaine question or not uh
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
how many markets do we have I have uh
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid small large and
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
individual is that the market that we
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
have that's our insured
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
people so in terms of how individuals
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
get coverage there are a number of
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
different ways they can do that as
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
you've identif ified so obviously you
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
have your government sponsored program
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that's your Medicare Medicaid that's
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
not something we oversee that's done by
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
the State Department of Health and Human
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
Services in the federal
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
government you then have fully insured
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
plans that are established under Arisa
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
which is a federal law um most of your
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
large employers are self-funded again
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's outside of our regulatory purview
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
although we do try to leverage our
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
relationships with the carriers to
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
address consumer issues uh in those
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
plans what we oversee are the fully
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
insured individual small group and large
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
group market so that's kind of the full
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
Kaleidoscope of coverages that people
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
can access in New Hampshire okay follow
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
up just for a second further question
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could you let us know
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
approximately the percentages of each
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
one of
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
these we got that chart last week oh
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
okay yep you've got the chart but in
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
terms of what we oversee which is again
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
is the fully
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
insured um individual small group large
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
group Market that represents
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
approximately 30% okay of health
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
coverage in New Hampshire thank you I'd
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
also refer you to um our annual report
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
that breaks down in a lot of detail all
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the different markets the numbers
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
ratios and it also includes um some
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
stuff about the self-insured market as
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
well okay it's my stack ofil
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere okay
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
to ask a higher level
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
question if the department is a supports
 
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
supposed or is taking no position on on
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as part of your answer but as a
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
policy question does the department in
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
general support reducing prescription
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
costs at the point of sale for
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare consumers and and if so do
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
you think that might help people in
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
their decision of whether they fill
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
their prescription or don't fill their
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
prescription and and in general help
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
them take those medications they need if
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
they have to make that tough decision to
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
walk away when the pharmacist says it's
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
50 hundred $20 or whatever sure and
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately would that drive better
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
patient outcomes so as a policy decision
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
support lowering prescription costs at
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
the point of sale as a way to improve
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
patient outcomes well as a fundamental
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
matter obviously we want to see healthy
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
proposals that bring down the cost of
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
medications that people need how best to
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
do that as I've mentioned a couple of
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
times at this point as it pertains to
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
this proposal is a policy decision for
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
you to make again I don't know exactly
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
how this plays out so
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
could you potentially see lower costs at
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
point of sale perhaps but is there a
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
cost shift into premium that either
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
negates the saving or causes the saving
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
to be overwhelmed and and ends up being
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
a net negative to to the consumer again
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how that plays out
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh Dr AZ is here also works for our
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
department spends a great amount of his
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
time uh looking at those very very
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
issues issues uh and it's complicated
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
Michelle Dr anything to
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
add the only thing I would add is the
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of insurance is to have a
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
large number of individuals come
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
together to share that risk so by doing
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
that you're pulling you know the risk
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
that you get stuck with a high cost
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
prescription drug and have to you know
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
someone has to cover that is spread out
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
among everyone if you do point of sale
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
that risk is not not necessarily being
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
spread out among everyone so I just keep
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
that in mind too a big picture of how
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance works but there's a lot of
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
nuances here there's a lot of you know C
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
but that's dead on what the issue is
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
because it let's face it rebates are
 
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
because it let's face it rebates are
adverse

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
selection in the insurance market right
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
now the biggest problem is the high
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
deductible plans that an employer
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
chooses that
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
deductibility so theoretically you
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need these baates if someone
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
chose a very low deductible you know
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
very high you you know coverage and then
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need this rebates at all
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
but that if you choose the the the
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
problem is that by the rebate is you're
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
now mudding the
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
waters in terms of that choice that that
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
person made or their employer made in
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
terms of what insurance plan they chose
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of deductibles in co-base yes
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
represent MCU follow up yeah thank
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for the quick overview on risk
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
pooling and insurance which I think
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee understands
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
risk pooling and the basics of insurance
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's car or health but thanks
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
for the quick overview but I guess the
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
opposite applies right when you when you
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
have uh you know healthy patients and
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
you pick off some of them least healthy
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
or unhealthy and you want to skew that
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
risk risk pool you could literally make
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite argument and say if
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
you you drive people away from taking
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
their medications you drive them closer
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
to some of the most common and most
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
expensive treatments like say just for
 
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.230 align:start position:0%
expensive treatments like say just for
instance

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
dialysis right I mean that's one of the
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
biggest draws on Healthcare dialysis and
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's why there's the big efforts to
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
you know drive to home hemodialysis and
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
keep people away from kidney transplants
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
and I mean I can name 50 other disease
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
states that are exactly the same so the
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
issue is keep them on the medic ations
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that the other people in those pieces
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the pie don't bear the high risk and
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
we don't do the exact opposite of what
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so I mean the same
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
applies and and that is the problem with
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the high deductible and low
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
deductible I me because the Health Care
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
system has shifted from HMO over the
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
years from when I first joined your
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee years ago but it shifted so we
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
balance represent
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
spear I know that rebates don't apply to
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
all drugs I know typically they don't
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
generics they don't apply for drugs that
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
have no competition that are still
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
within their patent limits and patent
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
times and whatever other exclusivity
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
things they have do you have any idea
 
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
what percentage of
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
drugs either volume I guess it's really
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
a question for you either volume wise
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
cost wise or whatever that we will have
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry the Pharm we have someone
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
from the pbms who will help you no I was
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay could you repeat that
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
there so only a small proportion of
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
drugs actually fetch robust rebates and
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
so that's important I understand it's a
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
good question it's constantly
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
changing and it's mostly branded drugs
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you very much I think
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
set okay uh so I have Rachel Lam from
 
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
set okay uh so I have Rachel Lam from
representing

00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that thank you
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
for receiving my testimony my name is
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
Rachel coddle leam representing Pharma
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
which represents a trade Association of
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
the leading Innovative brand name
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
biopharmaceutical manufacturers um and
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of our members
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
to express support for Senate Bill 555
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
as others have explained negotiations
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
between pharmaceutical manufacturers
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
Health insurers and Pharmacy benefit
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
managers result in significant rebates
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
and discounts and this bill would
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
require at least 50% of the rebates that
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
insurers and pbms receive from
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturers to be
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
applied to lower the cost of medicines
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire patients at the point
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
of sale this is a viable policy solution
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
that many states are considering and
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
some have already enacted to make
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
medicines more affordable because it
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
would provide patients with direct
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
immediate savings to lower their outof
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
pocket cost for prescription medicines
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
which in turn helps patients access and
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
adhere to the medicines they need our
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
industry is concerned that in 2023 alone
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
the approximately $344 billion do in
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
rebates and discounts paid by
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturers this is at national scale
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
are not making their way to offsetting
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
Patient costs at the pharmacy counter
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
and as it stands today in New Hampshire
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
insurers and pbms are not required to
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
share any portion of these negotiated
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
discounts directly with patients and to
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
see how these price concessions are not
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
currently benefiting most patients it's
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
very important to look at the growing
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
gap between the undiscounted list price
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
of medicines and a medicine's net price
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
after rebates and discounts on average
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
net prices for brand medicines are 50%
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
lower than list prices as a result of
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
these price concessions and in fact more
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
than half of spending on brand medicines
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
on average is retained by Health
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
insurers pbms and others in the
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical supply chain and not the
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who researched and
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
developed the medicine but at the same
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
time and even while net price growth for
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
brand medicines has been at or below
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
inflation for the last 6 years many many
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
patients are being forced to pay more
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for their medicines and
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is because of an increase in
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
deductibles and the use of Co Insurance
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
the use of which has increased
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
significantly over the last decade the
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
share of patient outof pocket drug
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
spending attributable to co insurance
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
has more than doubled over the past 10
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
years while the share attributable to
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
deductibles has tripled And yet when
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
patients facing their deductible or
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
paying co-insurance the amount they must
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
pay for their medicine is often based on
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
the full list price and this is even
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
while their insurer and PBM are only
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
paying the discounted amount they
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the manufacturer and
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
this means that the cost to patients is
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
often much higher than the cost to their
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
health plan and that's for the same
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
medicine on the same prescription and
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that this problem
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
is unique to coverage of prescription
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
medicines patients do receive the
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
benefit of negotiated discounts when
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
sharing in costs for doctor or hospital
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
visits but they often do not receive the
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
same benefit for prescription drugs and
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
fixing this broken part of the system
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
and sharing these savings not only has
 
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
an impact for that patient at the
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
pharmacy counter but could have a
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
broader positive impact on the Health
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
Care System lowering patients cost at
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy can improve health outcomes
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
and generate savings through improved
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
adherence and the elimination of
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
avoidable health care costs poor
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
medication adherence is associated with
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
increased hospitalizations nursing home
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
Admissions and physician visits yet in
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
2021 61% of commercially insured
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
patients did not fill their new
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
prescription when outof pocket cost
 
00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
prescription when outof pocket cost
exceeded

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
$250 when patients cannot afford the
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
outof pocket cost for their medications
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
this can lead to patients rationing
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
their medicines or not taking them which
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
can result in devastating consequences
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
to their health and as I start to
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments I just want to
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
highlight that passing through rebates
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
at the point of sale could save patients
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
on their outof pocket costs without
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
raising insurance premiums three states
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
West Virginia Arkansas and Indiana have
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
already enacted rebate pass through laws
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony previously that
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
in Arkansas which requires insurers and
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
pbms to share 100% of the savings they
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate on medicines directly with
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
patients a review of 2024 insurance rate
 
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:39.799 align:start position:0%
filings indicates the plans are passing
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
through drug rebates to patients at the
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacy counter and that there has been
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
no material impact on premium rate
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
increases for Arkansas still New
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's approach in Senate Bill 555
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
which would require 50% pass through is
 
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
more measured than other approaches
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
requiring full pass through so in
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion our industry feels strongly
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
that Senate Bill 555 balances the goals
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
and controlling premiums and helping
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
patients where they need it most which
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
is at the pharmacy counter so for all
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
these reasons we urge the committee to
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 555 thank you
 
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.710 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 555 thank you
represent

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
spear I noticed in the list of people
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
that you say have some effect on the
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
price insurance companies deductibles
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
pbms all these folks
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
drug companies that manufacture drugs
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
are not listed in that
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
list so my question
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
is I looked uh but I've got to form this
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
thing in a form of a question
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
so you sure you're asking the right
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
industry that's that's who I'm talking
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
about the drug
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I see drug prices going up
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
on average uh somewhere between 6 and
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
15% a year based on analysis by a number
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare how does that factor into why
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
patients are having trouble affording
 
00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.630 align:start position:0%
patients are having trouble affording
their

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
drugs I mean it doesn't that count and
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
realizing that I do know what the profit
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
rate is on drugs so be careful how you
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
answer that certainly no I appreciate
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
the question and I think I'd start by
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
saying that we certainly recognize that
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
we have a role to play and you know I
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
think if any any one of us could go back
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
to start and and go back to a system
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
that was much more simpler we certainly
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
would do that I think that manufacturers
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
though are as you point out I'm
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative one entity in a complex
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
supply chain um that takes a medication
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturer that researches
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
and develops the medicine to the patient
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
at the point of sale and there are many
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
entities along the way that um receive
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
compensation for Distributing that
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
medication to a patient and so um I
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
think that there are a lot of perverse
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
incentives in the system as it's
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
designed today and I think that
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
correcting some of these misaligned
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
incentives is is one way to start to
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
help patients not only in the longer
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
term but also um in the more immediate
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
term as as we feel strongly that this
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
do okay representative
 
01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.430 align:start position:0%
do okay representative
Herbert

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
um I've been listening to this
 
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.789 align:start position:0%
um I've been listening to this
conversation

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask a question right
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
would you believe but have you uh as
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
representing your group uh have
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
you ideas as to what the
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would would should look like
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
from your
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
perspective I mean I have I believe the
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
fact is a lot of the
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
financing of R&amp;D actually comes from the
 
01:00:57.039 --> 01:00:58.069 align:start position:0%
financing of R&amp;D actually comes from the
federal

01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
government and uh so as a result of that
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh I have I have I think it's important
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
to realize that the taxpayer and the
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
federal government have been the major
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
financer financer of
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
R&amp;D and uh but okay I would like to hear
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
some ideas specifically that could be
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
part of this legislation or in addition
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
to this legislation that you think would
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
be more effective than the legislation
 
01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.029 align:start position:0%
be more effective than the legislation
we

01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the question I think
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
that um first I would start by um
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the private investment
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
in research and development um
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers on average invest around
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
three times more than the total annual
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget of the National Institute of
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
Health and research and investment so
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
the Private Industry is really crucial
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
to not only um the research and
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
development phase but also bringing a a
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
fully formed drug to Market um however
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
to your question about um ideas I think
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
that we really do view this approach as
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
a very balanced and measured approach
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
that balances um controlling premiums
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
with providing direct benefit to
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
patients at the pharmacy counter and in
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
addition um concerning other ideas that
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
that our industry supports we in terms
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
of misaligned incentives which I've just
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we we feel strongly that
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
breaking the link between um Pharmacy
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
benefit manager compensation which is
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
currently tied to the list price of
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
medication I spoke a little bit about
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
that gap between the list price and net
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
price of medicine um that really creates
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
some upward pressure on list price and
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
we feel strongly that breaking that link
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
um would create a lot of room in the
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
system to to bring prices down
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
overall but that should be all drugs not
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
just your new latest greatest one
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it I mean I represent that the
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
brand biopharmaceutical manufacturers
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
and um you know I I think that a lot of
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
patients um who take brand medicines
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
have chronic and complex conditions and
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
though that's a reason we feel strongly
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill would would really
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
benefit those patients why shouldn't we
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
just ban these high deductible plans why
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
don't we solve this problem for
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
everybody just get rid of the high
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
deductible plans and and hope that the
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh pharmaceutical companies will just
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
lower their prices so that we don't have
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
as big of an insurance increase yeah you
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
know I think I think that we're willing
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
to have conversations and be a partner
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
with our other industry Partners to to
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation about the best
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
way to to lower the cost of healthare
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
for consumers and certainly we we really
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
think this bill is one way to do that it
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
is okay thank
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
you oh all right I give up thank you I
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
up represent bam yeah thank you for
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question why are
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals so much more expensive
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
in the US than any other country in the
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
world I think that looking when we
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
compare you know pharmaceutical prices
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the United States and other countries
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
we're kind of making an apples and
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
oranges comparison um you know other
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
countries have resorted to government
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
price setting and in those countries we
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
know that patients um have access to
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
fewer new Med medications and it takes
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
longer um for for patients to get the
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
medications that they need and I think
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
that you know that might not sound like
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
such a big deal but if you're a patient
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
waiting um for a breakthrough new cancer
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
medication for example um in a country
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
in Europe that might not have the new
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
medication on the market um and that's
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
the life-saving treatment you need um I
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
think that changes the conversation a
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
lot so um I I think there are a lot of
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
variables there certainly um patients
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know who are in other countries that
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
do have government price setting
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
proposals um do not do not face um
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me do not are not subject to the
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
same middlemen the system that we are
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
are subject to here in the United
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
States yes among others okay thank
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
represent we you already past our time
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
and you I got a pile of cards here so go
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
ahead ask questions thank you Mr
 
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll keep I'll keep it quick
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
some of your testimony was really
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
interesting you talked about the um the
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
premiums not going down I'm curious I'm
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
sorry if I missed it did the rebates
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
start to get cut off so when
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
do you understand what I mean did did
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers then since they were
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
forced to pass them on did they just say
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to do rebates
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
anymore no in those States the the study
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
the specific study which was produced by
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
mman shows that rebates are in fact
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
passing through to patients at the
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy counter and and we don't have
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
evidence to date that rebates have have
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
decreased so they kept they kept doing
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
them anyways yes rebates were're passing
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
through we find that some companies
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
offer do the rebates and some do
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
not but in the states they passed they
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
kept doing them according to her her
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank you
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh chair we'll call
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
H oh hi thank you chair hunt it's h I
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
would like to invite uh Curtis Barry up
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
to testify along with me if that's okay
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'll go first if that's okay um good
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee U my name is Curtis Barry here
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
on behalf of uh pcma which is the
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical Care Management
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
Association the national trade
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
Association for the PBM industry um
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be the target uh first of all I
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
will uh say at the outset and I'll
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
probably repeat myself this bill does
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
nothing to lower the cost of
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs it cost shifts um
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
I've left you to to illustrate that I've
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
left you a package the front page looks
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
pcma um the second and third sheets I
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
think are most telling uh second one
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
this going from 2018 to
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
2023 in
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
2018 it took the top seven brands
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
of name brand top seven drugs of name
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
brand Pharmaceuticals to equal all the
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
generic drug
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
spending in 2023 that's down to two only
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
two drugs equals the entire spend for
 
01:07:39.799 --> 01:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
two drugs equals the entire spend for
generic

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
generic
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
drugs the second page illustrates for
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
you and I won't walk you through it but
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
illustrates for you the top 10 selling
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
drugs in their patent history this is
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
important because as you can see a
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
number of them most of them have the
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
lowest number of patents is 57 this is
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
the game that Pharma plays by extending
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
their patents and keeping the the name
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
brand drugs
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
expensive so what are rebates rebates
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
are a volume discount negotiated between
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
a PBM and a
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer it's effective because pbms
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
typically the larger ones or the smaller
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
ones have a lot more lives than their
 
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.950 align:start position:0%
ones have a lot more lives than their
client

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
client
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
companies so a PBM can negotiate with a
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturer on behalf of tens of
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
millions of lives versus for example the
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire negotiating on
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
its own on behalf of tens of thousands
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
of lives there's leverage with
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
volume um this is why health plans of
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
all different types self-insured
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
governments commercial insurers use pbms
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
they negotiate steeper
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
discounts but as a couple of the
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
discussions just alluded to recently
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
rebates only apply to a small fraction
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
of of the dispensed drugs first of all
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
rebates don't apply to generics generics
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
are inexpensive by Nature rebates also
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
don't apply in the case where a drug is
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the only choice there are not competing
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
drugs for a condition or a disease if
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
you're a manufacturer and you're the
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
only game in town you have no incentive
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
to lower your price the analysis shows
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
that less than 3% of drugs dispensed
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
have rebates meaning if to use the
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
figure that you heard from the insurance
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
department less than
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
30% uh of the commercial insurance to
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
which this applies is less than 30% of
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the market so we're talking about less
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
than 3% of the drugs in less than 30% of
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
the market those people will benefit but
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
the rest of us um will see an
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
impact um one of the logistical issues
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
with the bill um rebates are typically
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
applied in the rearview mirror they
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
applied on a quarterly basis looking at
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
the volume in the previous quarter so
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
all this bill would ask is for an
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
estimate to be made and that's not going
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
to be
accurate

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill has three impacts from our
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
perspective one it drives utilization to
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
higher price drugs which then everybody
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
else will pay um two and please this is
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
not a a lower tier worry I hate them I'm
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
sorry for the pun but it it it is a
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
concern um it allows Pharma a look into
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
the proprietary and confidential
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
information that is the negotiation
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
between a PBM and a manufacturer on a
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
particular drug the US Federal Trade
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
Commission found in a report quote if
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers learn the exact amount of
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
rebates offered by competitors the
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
required disclosures may lead to higher
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals um in addition uh at the
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
Federal level the Congressional budget
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
office looked at this issue and
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
estimated and this was specific to
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare because that's obviously their
 
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.149 align:start position:0%
Medicare because that's obviously their
per

01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
purview it estimated that while some
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare beneficiaries would have lower
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
drug costs overall cost to the Medicare
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
program would increase by $170 billion
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
over 10 years causing premiums to
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
increase for all beneficiaries CBA also
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
estimated that Medicaid costs were
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
increased by $7 billion over the same
 
01:11:21.159 --> 01:11:22.830 align:start position:0%
increased by $7 billion over the same
period

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
um continuing on the impact of rates
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard examples from other states
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
I suggest a longer look at when those
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills were effective most of them were
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
2023 with the exception of West Virginia
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
and what is the year in which the the
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
they're citing the rate increase is it
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
using the experience of that law being
 
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.669 align:start position:0%
using the experience of that law being
in

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
effect um I'm not going to repeat uh the
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's data I think they
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
did a a fine job of that um in and
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
lastly I will um I think address some of
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
the assertions by the sponsor and others
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note first of all the
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor cited a patient or someone they
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
know with you know kitchen counter full
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
of drugs given the previous
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
data I think it's fair to assume that a
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
lot of those are generic drugs or the
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
only game in town and the rebates aren't
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to apply
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
anyway but if we're cost
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
shifting does it help the system does it
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
help all of us if we're Shifting the
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
cost to everybody else with the co-pays
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and increase the co-pay from $10 to
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
$15 but more importantly and also a
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
point that I don't think should be lost
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
if this is great policy for the patients
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire why did
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate specifically explicitly
 
01:12:47.239 --> 01:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
the Senate specifically explicitly
exempt

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I I apologize Mr chair this
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like a flip rhetorical question
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
it should be a serious question why all
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
so did the Senate explicitly exempt the
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
state employees health plan if this is
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
good policy shouldn't the state
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
employees and their families of the
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire benefit from this
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
policy the reality is as he alluded to
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes there was an impact and it doesn't
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
seem to make sense logically to me Mr
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee that
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
you can acknowledge that there's a cost
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the state the state employees plan by
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
passing this policy which the bill
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
exempts and that there's a cost to
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the Medicaid director test
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
testified at the Senate hearing asking
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be Exempted but there would be no
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
cost increase to the commercial
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
insurance it just doesn't make sense um
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'll ask Sam to if I missed anything and
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
he's here to help answer questions if
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
there are any and I should be specific I
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
apologize the objection that I'm talking
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
to is the first page of the bill section
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
two of the bill uh essentially lines 27
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
to 29 we have no issue with the
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
increased reporting uh in fact I think
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
you'll hear testimony later on that the
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
second half of the bill which was in a
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
senate Amendment um was negotiated with
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the department and we're perfectly
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
fine with that so thanks the only thing
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
that I would the only thing that I would
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
add is uh Maine did take a look at this
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
policy proposal this year legislative
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
session and they did do a fiscal note
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
for the state employee plan and found
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
that for fiscal year 24 2024 2025 it
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
would be an increase in $2 million Al
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
loone to the state employee plan if this
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
policy were to pass and that bill did
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
die uh in committee due to that high
 
01:14:26.639 --> 01:14:28.270 align:start position:0%
die uh in committee due to that high
fiscal

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
note uh so I would with that they didn't
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
just pull it out of the bill like like
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
our Senate did they just killed the
 
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
our Senate did they just killed the
whole

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
thing correct yes so we're happy to take
 
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.550 align:start position:0%
thing correct yes so we're happy to take
any

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions re in bullo first thank you
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you think this
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
is just a Feelgood
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill I think that asked to you know the
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
old uh issue that that asks us to assess
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
the motivations I really can't answer
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
that Curtis has been around a long
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
time okay representative
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
McVey um thank you Mr chairman if if I'm
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
understanding you correctly you're
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're really saying in the long run
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to have the actual
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
opposite effect of what we're what you
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
you think the bill is proposing to do is
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
that correct yes that's correct I mean I
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any doubt that very
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
few people will benefit but you can't
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
take the figure whatever the figure is
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department $90
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
million you can't just take it out of
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
the system and have it go
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere and the reality is the minimum
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
loss ratio in terms of how rates are set
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
um is over a three-year average so
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to really see the
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
effect for three plus years before where
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
you start to see the premiums will
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
increase represent preli thank thank you
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and allowing my
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
question um drug pricing is a bit of a
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
black box so can you help me understand
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
you represent pbms about how many are
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
there in the country and what how are
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
they compensated thank you for the
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
question representative pcas uh has
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
about 20 PBM members but out in the rest
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the United States I believe there's
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
about 60 other pbms all competing for
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
business that's my understanding
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
yes 60 sorry 60 60 that's it just 60 yes
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay and how are they compensated how
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
are they compensated how are they
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
compensated they administer prescription
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
drug benefits for payers uh through
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
self-insured and fully insured plans
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay but do they get a percentage of the
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
drug how are they compensated thank you
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
for the question it's all dependent on
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
how the plan wants to design their
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
benefit and pay for those benefits at
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it's a
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
contraction and under statute we are not
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to know exactly what is the
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
relationship between an insurance
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
company and health care provider so it's
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually the same thing is true for
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals doctors anyone who's who is uh
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know has a contract with an
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company it's secret secret and
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
the reason being is that the competitor
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
the other insurance company they want to
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that they don't know what they
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
got in the
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
contract representa
 
01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
contract representa

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
um what does break the link mean to
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm sorry representative could
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
you repeat the
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
question the uh uh the representative of
 
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.430 align:start position:0%
question the uh uh the representative of
the

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I asked her a question is
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to improve the
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
legislation what would you advise and
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
the advice came in the form of break the
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
link which doesn't mean much to me so
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure I I'm I what is
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
break the link evidently doesn't mean
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
anything to him either so I'm not
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with that phrase
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
so no answer we okay anybody else seeing
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%

555 at Nami New Hampshire we have heard
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
from many Granite Staters who are not
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
able to afford their
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
medications they resort to skipping
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
doses taking reduced Doses and delaying
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
filling their medications due to their
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
inability to afford their
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
medications uh further in June of 2023
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the Center for Disease Control and
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
prevention National Center for health
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
statistics released a data brief which I
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
have included um as a part of my
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um regarding adults that did
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
not take their medications as prescribed
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
to reduce the out-of-pocket costs uh
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
they found that 8.2% of adults aged 18
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
to 64 did not take their medications as
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
prescribed due to the cost but what they
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
also found was this jumped up to
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
20% for folks who had a disability and
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
it was 18% for folks that reported not
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
feeling well or um having medical
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
conditions that impacted their their
 
01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.189 align:start position:0%
conditions that impacted their their
health

01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
um we know that um when folks don't take
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
their medications as prescribed it
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
worsens their symptoms and could lead to
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
costly hospitalizations it would be
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary if the medications were more
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
affordable there's been a lot of
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about increase of premiums
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
and this impact that this bill might
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
have another thing that increases
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
premiums is when people have to be
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalized hospitalization are
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
extremely costly and so if someone's not
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
able to take a medication that could
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
cost a few hundred dollar that results
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
in them being in the hospital that costs
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that can also
 
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that can also
increase

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
premiums um the sharing of these rebates
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
um will help some people um be able to
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
afford their medications that could end
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
up prevent preventing uh costly other
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
interventions in the long run and one of
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
the things that's not in my test
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that I wanted to share with
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
this committee is the fact that I myself
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
out of pocket pave between 5 and $600
 
01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
for my
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
medications those are medications that I
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
need in order to be able to come here
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
and testify because without them I would
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to work I would not be able
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
to function um so I just wanted to
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
relate that that it is a real issue um
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it's an issue that impacts a lot of
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
people including people who come here
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
um and testify before you um I we do
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to seriously
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
consider passing this bill and I'm happy
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you may
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
have uh represent spearers first
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
caved I thought you said you were done
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not done I I'm never
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
done I just take a break uh thank you
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
for my uh asking uh allowing me to ask a
 
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.149 align:start position:0%
for my uh asking uh allowing me to ask a
question

01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
I I I understand the point that you're
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
making and I appreciate
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
that but the T drugs that we're talking
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
about for which rebates are available
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
are brand name
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
drugs and do you know that have no
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
competition do you know if any of those
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
do have competition applies that's why
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing the rebate is because they
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
do have comp but but of the drugs that
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
people need
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
that are covered by your organization
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
that you deal with do you know of if
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
that in fact is what is causing their
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
their uh co-pay
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
problems I don't know that for sure but
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are a lot of um
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
brand brand name brand new anticho
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
medications that are on the market and I
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
think the insurers would probably be
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
better um better able to answer the
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
exact um psychiatric medications that
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
are subject to rebates um but I'm also
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
happy to um talk with um uh Miss croll
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
and um Miss Dunlap to find out um and
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
then provide you the information about
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
medications that they have rebates for
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
that are um psychiatric
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
medications okay representative
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
buros thanks for taking my question I
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
thought it was an excellent point you
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
raised about cost going up of f these
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
folks don't get their medications do you
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
know if there's any studies been done
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
about those costs versus you know what
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion we've had here about
 
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
the discussion we've had here about
raising

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
raising
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
premiums I don't know but I'm happy to
 
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to you I
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
think that' be I I think that' be an
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
interesting um statistics to have I will
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
I will absolutely look into that and get
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
you represent muu thank you for taking
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
my question thank you Mr chairman are
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
some of the medications that individuals
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
you work with with in the Mental Health
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
Community are some of those qu those
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
medications long-term medications that
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
then eventually need to be switched to
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
newer brand name medications because
 
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
when they're on them long term they
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
develop cardiovascular or cardiac side
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
effects like SSRI medications that cause
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
cardiac issues and then a newer one
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
comes out and then the
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
providers want to try them and so
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
specifically subject to some of these
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
rebates is that is that something that
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
you encounter in the mental health thank
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
you for the question I I haven't looked
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
into that um again because I don't
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
prescribe medications I'm a lawyer by
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
trade not a doctor by trade um so I
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't know um the exact uh treatment
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
protocols that folks have but again it's
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
one of those things that I'm happy to
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
talk with some of the doctors at New
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and and get back to
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
you on uh their experience with some of
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
these psychiatric
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
medications okay
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much thank you
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call in Sabrina Dunlap from
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chairman hunt and members
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Sabrina
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I'm director of government
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
relations for anthm we are opposed to SB
 
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.550 align:start position:0%
relations for anthm we are opposed to SB
555

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
555
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
um and I I not noted uh I heard it was
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the sponsor that Anthem
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
does 100% at point of sale and that did
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
not come up during the Senate hearing
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I just want to note that I was
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually here during the Senate hearing
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
because you were discussing I believe HB
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
1081 one of the ambulance bills um so we
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
were in fact opposed to this bill in the
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
Senate and we remain opposed to this
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
bill and I think the key issue is that
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
this bill interferes with how carrier
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
and pbms make decisions that best serve
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
their members with respect to point of
 
01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
their members with respect to point of
sale

01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
rebates um you know different car
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
carriers take different approaches to
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of rebates to give at the
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
point of sale but that simply reflects
 
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
the diversity of our members and
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
approaches that we take in doing what is
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
best for them in terms of access to
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
medication and lowering
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
costs by forcing all carriers to give at
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
least 50% of rebates at the point of
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
sale s sp555 takes away the flexibility
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
to do what is best for our members and
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to address the high cost
 
01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:26.709 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to address the high cost
of

01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
drugs the price of drugs are set by the
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
drug companies so if we want to tackle
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
the high cost of drugs this bill does
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
not do
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
that um so I think I will I will wrap up
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
there and I'm happy to take any
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so if I understand
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly you're saying
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that uh we should pass enabling
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow a pharmaceutical
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
comp insurance company to choose what it
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
wants to do with those rebat Ates I
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
believe that's the current state so I
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
think um our current state of affairs
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
gives carriers the choice to do what we
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
think is best right so you might think
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
that some year that by advertising that
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
you do rebates that you might actually
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
get more customers you would use it as a
 
01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:12.590 align:start position:0%
get more customers you would use it as a
marketing

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
tool I don't know how to respond to that
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative belli
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you quick question so um can you
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
give us maybe some insight if you know
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
as to why Anthem decided to you know do
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
the 100% rebate what factors maybe went
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
into that decision thank you that is a
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
very good question um I am happy to chat
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
more I don't want to misstate anything
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
it goes above and beyond my
 
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of math and actuary I will
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
say a lot of a lot of thought and um
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
different factors went into it I'm sure
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I I do believe it has not always
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
been 100% um and so the the simple
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
answer is it's a business decision
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
obviously we think that's best for our
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
members at this
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
moment representative buros thanks for
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question this may be um and I
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can answer this but
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
what do you think would be a better
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
route to take rather than this bill to
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
for to help somebody for example taking
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
Humera who's just got these outrageous
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
costs and they they can't do it what
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
would be a better
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
solution thank you for that question um
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great question I I think
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it simple and say I think the
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem is the high cost of
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
these specialty drugs um and I know that
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a complex system and so it's not just
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know pulling one thread or another
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
everything is sort of woven together so
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily that simple but I
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
do think at the end of the day that's
 
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
what we're all grappling with is the
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
high cost of specialty drugs and those
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
prices are set by the drug companies
 
01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.590 align:start position:0%
prices are set by the drug companies

representative
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
mcade oh thank you Mr
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
chairman would you say that current
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
keeping the current system would
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
potentially allow a more competitive
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
Marketplace than what would be dictated
 
01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.830 align:start position:0%
Marketplace than what would be dictated
in

01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
555 thank you for the question I think
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
what we currently have is a um system
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
that allows carriers the flexibility to
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
do what they think is best
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah well would you say would be more
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
competitive and could in fact lead to
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
more uh price
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
breaks I I don't know that I don't know
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you very much thank you

leadership uh for all of those
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
organizations uh I'll make this really
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
brief uh and summarize what was in my
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
testimony we know through the national
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
rural Health Association the CDC the
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
federal office of rural Health policy
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
and others that rural people are older
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
sicker and poorer than their Urban
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
counterparts there is a higher ratio of
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
co-occurring chronic illness among rural
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
residents than among the the more
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
urbanized population so what I'm here to
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
do is to ask you to think
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
about this smaller group of people who
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
could left be left out of the equation
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
when large numbers of people are used in
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
a formula to calculate uh certain kinds
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
policies please just keep in mind that
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
our rural residents are in fact uh with
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
a higher uh volume of a higher
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
percentage of chronic co-occurring
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
conditions which uh are costly to treat
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're costly for the people themselves
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
let's keep in mind that please that
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
these people are going to rely on
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
methods of reducing their out-of-pocket
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
costs for their
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
medications it's critical for them we
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
know that the downstream effects of
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
people skimping on their medication not
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
taking their medication is going to
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
result in an overall cost of Health Care
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
to the entire system we know it's going
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
to result in more ed visits more
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations more
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
rehospitalizations so I'm asking you to
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
think about those population our rural
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
populations around who uh may be
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat underrepresented these days
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there and thank you and
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative M thank you Mr
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr low for coming in
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
tonight um do you do you think that in
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
the rural communities that passing this
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill might help improve outcomes from
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
some of those chronic conditions that
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
cost us the most I do thank you so in
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we can't we the premium
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
set by an insurance company is flat all
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
the way to the state regardless of your
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
rural or not
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
rural so the only the only way I could
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
say that yes if someone wants to pay a
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
lower co-pay is to choose a higher you
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
know a lower deductible
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
plan because the premium is set is flat
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
to the whole state it doesn't matter
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
whether you're rural or not
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'm accepting what you say that I
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know I don't see that there's a
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
question there I don't have any response
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'm merely pointing out that our
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
patients uh are in need of some kind of
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
re thank you um my question is you
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
represent New England rural Health
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
Association yes the New England rural
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
Health Association do uh does the
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
association deal with the natural paths
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
or alternative medicines
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
because what I've seen in my lifetime so
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
many people that take so many drugs that
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
are unnecessary One Drug to replace the
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
other drug for counteracting that do you
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
deal with any alternative you know um
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
positions I I'm sure that we have some
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
members who are in that organization
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's not probably a majority it's not
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
even close to a majority we probably
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
have some I I can't comment on that
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
group in particular okay thanks thank
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you uh chair we'll
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
call in Peter bragon from Harvard
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Peter bragon
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
representing Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
the states uh not for-profit health
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
insurance plan serving about 50,000 of
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
our state's residents our friends and
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors uh with their health insurance
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
needs um here in opposition to the bill
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
as the as noted by the chair I will
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
start though by uh there are a number of
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
areas where I agree with Senator avart
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh certainly Harvard pkam Healthcare uh
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
supports the initiative to make the
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
reporting more transparent section one
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is um lines 1 through
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
21 on the first page uh a few years ago
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
we passed a law that said or you I guess
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
you passed a law to um require uh some
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
attestation by the insurance companies
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
that they are passing the rebate values
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
on to members through the premiums and
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
but there was no details and so what the
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
department is receiving is information
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
that's not really helpful so section one
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill actually calls for more data
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be brought so then people can look
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
and see okay does this benefit we
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
believe um improving the transparency in
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting would demonstrate how
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
using pharmaceutical rebates to lower
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
premiums benefits our policy holders so
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with Senator avard on that I
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
also agree with Senator avart that drugs
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
are expensive I I think nobody disagrees
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
with that um unfortunately I don't think
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with and will address
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the situations he brought up one of the
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
people he talked about was a veteran uh
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to tr care uh a
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
federal health insurance program for
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
veterans another one was retired this
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect uh Medicaid Medicare uh
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
Social Security people on retirement um
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's something we see a lot of
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
time is people using anecdotes that
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't really apply so I agree though
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
with rard that drugs are expensive and
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a previous speaker said we don't set
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
the drug prices the drug companies set
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
the drug prices so if the problems the
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
drug prices are too expensive then um
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
the problem is with the drunk companies
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
themselves and the third thing I agree
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
with Senator avart on is what he said
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
about West Virginia he said the 2023
 
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
rate filings show the same increases in
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
rates in West Virginia as other states
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that's very true unfortunately the
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
law requiring the rebates to go back to
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
the uh members that point of sale uh
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
came in in 2022 and I passed along out
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
to you um an analysis of West Virginia
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
from acas signups that shows right in
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
the middle there in the yellow column
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
12.83% increase in insurance premiums in
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
the individual Market in 2022 the law
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
was passed in 21 insurance companies
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
factored it into their rates for 2022 a
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
12% increase oh by the way New
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's increase at the time
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
depending on how you count it was
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 3%
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh I will agree with Senator avar that
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
since then it's been the increases have
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
been the same because that first year of
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.990 align:start position:0%
 
133%

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
133%
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we believe that and I think the data
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
shows that uh the passage of a bill like
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 555 will certainly increase
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
costs you know we have very few tools
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
available to help decrease insurance
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
premiums everything else is pushing
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
premiums up we have very few tools that
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
help us reduce premiums pharmaceutical
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
rebates are one of those very small
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
number of tools that we have and we
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
believe that Senator Bill 555 erodes the
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
usefulness of that tool um certainly
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
remitting the rebates at the point of
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
sale will benefit some people uh as was
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
said about 3% of drugs so let's just
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
assume for a second 3% of individuals
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
may benefit from that but it will
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
significantly raise the cost of premiums
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
or cost share for for everybody else and
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's not just an issue of oh no I have
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
to pay more money uh I pay I don't know
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
close to $600 a month um so I'd have to
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
pay more it's not really that it's what
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
happens and I've talked about this
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
before on the insurance premiums on the
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
insurance cost sharing when you squeeze
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
one out the balloon right if you take
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
the cost away somewhere else the
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
insurance fery is not going to show up
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
and take that away that has to be
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
recovered somewhere else it's going to
 
01:39:22.109 --> 01:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
be either higher premiums or increased
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
cost shares deductible co-pays which
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
will have the effect of people no longer
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
getting insurance or getting insurance
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
policies that they themselves end up in
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
the situation where they can't afford to
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
pay for the drugs or the doctor's visits
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
or everything else so it's not just the
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
pure dollar issue it's what it does to
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
people and causes more people or
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
companies a company with 50 individuals
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
um you know multiply all these Effects
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
by 50 and so they're going to reduce
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
what they have and so our goal is to see
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
as many people as possible have health
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
insurance especially in the the small
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
group Market which we see uh as as
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
eroding over time how significant would
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
those increases to Consumers be while we
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
saw in uh West Virginia certainly it was
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
133% um currently the and by the way a
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
number of uh insurance carriers in New
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do this differently so Harvard
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim uh takes all the rebates we
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
receive and apply that to premiums other
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
companies as we discussed Anthem uh
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh reduces premiums by those
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
rebates other times they return the
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
rebates to the point of at the point of
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
sale um for us uh the value of the
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
rebates uh we currently use reduced the
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
premiums by about 7% the value of the
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
rebates is about 7% of the premiums um
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's logical to assume that a bill that
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
requires 50% of the rebates to go back
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
to the consumer at the point of sale
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's probably roughly a 3 and a half%
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
if our total value is 7% half of that is
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
3 and a half% that remaining 3 and a
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
half% has to go somewhere and like I
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
said it's not the insurance F I don't
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
know enough about Harvard pilgrims rates
 
01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
I know my rate like I said about 600
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
bucks a month so three and a half that's
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
another 20 bucks a month um for this
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
member per month so it's a significant
 
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:13.159 align:start position:0%
increase uh in the insurance rates that
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
people have to pay in addition to the
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
the effect on the premiums that way
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be administrative cost
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh we don't own our own PBM one of the
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions was why does Anthem do it this
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
way and I don't know why Anthem does it
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
that way Sabrina doesn't know either but
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors involved and I
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
don't expect that she would and I
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully no one ask me why Harvard does
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
it the way they do it uh but I do know
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
this that uh Harvard plgrm Healthcare is
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
a regional not for-profit health
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh the others in this
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
market are national for-profit health
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies uh who own their own
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
pbms they're big enough they're
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
profitable enough they can own the PBM
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
you get a ton of cost savings when you
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
PBM and you get to charge People Like Us
 
01:41:57.870 --> 01:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh a percentage of the fees in order to
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
do the work for you so in addition to
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
the the money that's going to go back to
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
the consumer at the point of sale that's
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
going to affect the premiums uh there's
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
an administrative cost that we have to
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
pay for somebody else to do all this
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
work to get the point of sale to work
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then finally we have to build a
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
cushion in there because there's a line
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill and I don't know what line
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
it is I'll look while I'm talking
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
$10,000 there it is on page two line 36
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
a fine not to exceed what un fortunately
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not to exceed that makes me feel
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
better $10,000 per violation so if we
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
make an error with our point and as was
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier these are estimates we
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't know until halfway through the
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
next year what those rebates were we
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
have an estimate of what they're going
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be based on our contracts but a lot
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
of it is based on volume we don't know
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
what those rebates are going to be if we
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
give the wrong rebate to somebody it's
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
$10,000 it's $10,000 per violation so
 
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a big cushion on
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
what we give back to the um the person
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
at the point of sale in order just to
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
cover our ass if you pardon the
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
expression uh to make sure I know I know
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you YouTube Remember YouTube
 
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
It's the former it's the former Center I
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
me had to had to throw that um so
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
there's a to compensate for the fees we
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
have to add more money to that so
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
there's a significant increase to the
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
cost both in terms of the money taken
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
away from the rebate pool that we use to
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
reduce premiums the administrative cost
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
and then this extra cushion that we have
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
in in addition to that um again I
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
pointed out it's been pointed out some
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
carriers already do this Anthem already
 
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
does it sometimes uh we don't I
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh you know they can own their
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
own pbms they're uh not non-for-profit
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
they're National so there's a lot of a
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
lot of things basically what this bill
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
does is it favors National for-profit
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance companies at the expense of
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
regional not for-profit health care
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
companies we believe it should be a free
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
market let the companies decide what
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to do let the companies
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
decide have some plans that do it this
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
way and some that do it that way let
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
some compan do it one way let others do
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
it another way and let the market sift
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
out what works out the best um I'll
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
point out that has already been pointed
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
out that the original bill um apparently
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
included the state health insurance plan
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
for employees as well as Medicaid and
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
based on testimony at the Senate hearing
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
oh no that will cost the state too much
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
money for those who say this won't cost
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
the state any money why did they
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
exclude self-insured plans like the
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
state's plan and Medicaid because it's
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
going to cost a lot of money
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
and then finally it's just the
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
philosophy of insurance right we
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
estimate what our costs are going to be
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
each year and we build our premiums
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
based on that and we by spreading those
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
costs across the entire base of our
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
clients and our members but in the same
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
way we should be able to do that with
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
our revenues as well we we spread our
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
costs across all the members we spread
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
revenues across all our members and that
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
results in lower premiums for everybody
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
so those are my main points I appreciate
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
word good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll I
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
represent uh ahip America's health
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
insurance plans and I work at Gallagher
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
Calahan and gartrell um we are opposed
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
to S
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
sp555 um we object to the proposed
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
mandate in section two of the bill that
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
would require at least 50% of the drug
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
um manufacturers rebates to be used uh
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
to lower the patients out-of pocket cost
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
at the point of sale um as you've heard
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
this only would apply in the fully
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
insured Market um it would not apply to
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare the VA Tri care um
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
self-funded obviously not the state
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
employee plan um and we do also object
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the provision in section two that
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
would increase um the fines on carriers
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
for each violation from
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
$2,500 um which is a standard um
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the New Hampshire's um health
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
insurance laws um so a four-fold
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
increase up to
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
$110,000 um that seems excessive and
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um the insurance department
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
already has the statutory Authority and
 
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
the tools should it need to take
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement action against a carrier um
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
including um suspending or re even
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
revoking a carrier's license to do
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
um uh similarly to the comments that um
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh Peter bragon made um we would I would
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
note that carriers don't object to the
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
enhanced reporting requirements um to
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance department those um
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
changes were proposed by the department
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and they are changes we are happy to
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
live with um then I would also note that
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
carriers do not object to the current
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
law which says that carriers must use
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
the drug manufacturers rebates um to
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
either lower um the premiums uh at the
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
point of sale um or some combination
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
thereof um so taking a step back as
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard um Health in from some of
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
the other speakers uh health insurance
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
carriers um in our opinion are Americans
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining power um negotiating lower
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
cost of care and lower drug prices for
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
plan enroles and that includes
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
negotiating um discounts off the list
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
price of drugs and being able to
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
maximize the impact of those discounts
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
um for all plan enroles by passing those
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
savings through as reductions in
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
premiums and other improvements um to
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
benefits um and I would say that I think
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
carriers are getting 100% of the rebates
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
from the pbms um I think those contracts
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
now are are are clear in terms of what's
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
coming through um as you've also heard
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
um you know these rebates um are just on
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
a select um brand named drugs that have
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
competition um so if there's no
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
competition um or if it's a generic
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
um there's uh um no rebate and the
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
reason that the manufacturers um are
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
willing to offer these discounts is so
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
their drugs can get um better placement
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
on the carrier's formularies and be
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
prescribed to more patients um and being
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
placed on the form getting better
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
placement on the formulary um means
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
being on Lower tiers and lower tiers are
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
um going to skip over some of this
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to repeat what
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
other people have said
 
01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.310 align:start position:0%
other people have said
[Music]

01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
um most insurers in New Hampshire um are
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
using the rebates to help lower premiums
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
and lower cost sharing for all enroles
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
in fully insured plans and as you know s
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
sp555 would mandate that they would have
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
to divert 50% of the rebates um away
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
from reducing premiums um and over to um
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
the point of
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
sale and as you've heard um from Harvard
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim you know for carriers that are
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
currently using rebates to reduce
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
premiums this bill will increase um the
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
premiums for members that's just plain
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
and simple when you redirect money away
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
from one pot toward another pot um
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
premiums will have to go up um and as
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard you know Anthem is one
 
01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
carrier that is um you know has recently
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
chosen to apply the rebate at the point
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
of sale um and you know certain folks
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
have pointed to this as a reason why the
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
Mandate in 555 should apply to all
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
carriers um and I find that um argument
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit puzzling in and our current
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
law promotes consumer choice where the
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
carriers have the opportunity in the
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
fully insured Marketplace to
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
differentiate themselves from one
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
another and offer different products
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
that apply the rebates in different ways
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the individual or the employer
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
whoever is purchasing the insurance plan
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
gets to choose whether they want a plan
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
that uses the rebates to lower premiums
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
or whether they want a plan that applies
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
the rebates a point of sale and so the
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
fact is that the New Hampshire
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
Marketplace is functioning just as the
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
current law intended um consumers want
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
and frankly deserve this Choice a
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
national survey that came out in October
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
of last year found that 91% of employers
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
say it is important to have flexibility
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
in choice in how their organization uses
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
rebate dollars our current law allows
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
for that choice and our current
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
Marketplace is offering that choice um s
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
sp555 would have the government
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
intervene in the this Market um and take
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
away that choice for New Hampshire
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
consumers uh ahip does not support that
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think you have correspondents
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
from the Bia the business and industry
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
Association that indicates that they
 
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
don't support that either um I also want
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
to address the question of how patients
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
who use rebated drugs benefit when
 
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
carriers are using the rebates to lower
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
premiums and approve the benefit
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
designed for all of the enroles um so
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
first these patients benefit from lower
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
co-pays or lower co- Insurance um
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
because the rebated drug is on a lower
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
tier um and in some cases that means
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
that could mean that the tier actually
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
brought them down from a co- Insurance
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
to a co-pay which is um also mean
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
savings for the patient um secondly um
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
they would benefit just like everybody
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
else would from lower premiums um and a
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
third point which hasn't been mentioned
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
here today is that um patients will see
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
lower um cost sharing overall when rebat
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
rebates are applied to premiums due to
 
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value requirements so
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value of plan is based on net
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
expenses after rebates so cost sharing
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
across all medical and all drug benefits
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
is reduced by rebates so it's not just
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
um the premiums that are lower but the
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
total cost sharing um is lower as
 
01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.870 align:start position:0%
total cost sharing um is lower as
well

01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
um you've been pointed to the um New
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance Department's annual
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
report um uh page uh slide 49 um again
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
as you've heard um the uh rebates in
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
2022 lowered the per member per month
 
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
cost of prescription drug expenses by
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
$38 down from 100
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
$147 per member per month down to 109
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
that is a 26% reduction um and as you've
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
heard also at the bottom of slide 49 it
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
talks about how the total rebate dollars
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
um uh in 2022 was 90 million and so
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about diverting
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
redirecting as much as 45 Mill million
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
half of that um away from premium
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
reductions um we've also talked about
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on S sp555 as introduced
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
um and how the um Department of
 
01:52:37.069 --> 01:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
administrative Services estimated that
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would have cost them $2
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
million Medicaid director estimated that
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
it would have cost them at least $30
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
million um and so as you've heard the
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
Senate was quick to carve out Medicaid
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the state employee plan but for
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
reasons I cannot explain was still happy
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
to impose this mandate on um businesses
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's employers and the
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
individuals in the fully insured Market
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
um if this is a good policy um it's not
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
clear to me why the state would um be so
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
quick to exempt itself um except that
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
there's the actual there's the cost
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
associated with it um there's other cost
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
um when the Trump Administration adopted
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
a similar point of sale rebate mandate
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the Medicare part D program cms's own
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
actuaries estimated that it would
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
increase premiums by 25% it would have
 
01:53:32.069 --> 01:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
cost taxpayers between 202 and 400
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
billion dollar um and would have led to$
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
137 billion windfall for pharmaceutical
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um Congress has
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
continuously disallowed this Federal
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
effect um I'll close and would be happy
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
to answer questions in closing nothing
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
in s sp555 addresses the root cause of
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
high drug cost for consumers which is
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
high list prices set by manufacturers
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
and their um and their profit driven
 
01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:08.510 align:start position:0%
and their um and their profit driven
motives

01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
um a a recent AARP report um looked at
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
2117 drugs that were on the market from
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
2006 to 2020 for these drugs the
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
cumulative price increase inre over that
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
time was nearly
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
280% while the increase in general
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
inflation over that same period was only
 
01:54:31.119 --> 01:54:32.910 align:start position:0%
inflation over that same period was only
32%

01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
32%
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
um when considering a bill like s sp555
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
please consider New Hampshire's
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
individuals and small employers who are
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
doing their best to keep up with Rising
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
healthc care cost and Rising drug prices
 
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
in the form of higher premiums and
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
higher cost sharing um those are the
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
people who would ultimately pay for this
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
proposed mandate um with numbers in you
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
know the tens of millions of dollars per
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
year ranged um so we support the new
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements um we would be
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
happy to live with the um current uh
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Pell so um
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the question
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
what what is you talked about the
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
formulary placement I'm not sure we
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
really talked about that a lot so is
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
that going to have a we allow this 50%
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
rebate what impact would it have um on
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
the formulary placement so that you know
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
will will these drugs remain at a point
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
where they're more expensive without the
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
rebate changing where they are uh placed
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
on the formulary
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
list it's a great question um
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
I think I want to get back to you on
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
that question I don't want to give you
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
the wrong answer
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
yeah represent M thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question since
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
your client ahip opposes sharing the
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
savings with the patients at the point
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
of sale any suggestions on how we can
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
improve outcomes and reduce those
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
prescriptions C prescription
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
costs how do you how do you suggest we
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you know carriers have um a lot of
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
programs around um medication to you
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
know working with their pbms um to try
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure to really work with patients
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
um but I think at the end of the day
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that we're and
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
and so the P those patients still would
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
get the benefits as I described they
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
would have the benefits of lower
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
premiums they would have the benefit of
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
overall lower cost sharing and they're
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to have the benefit of lower
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
co-pays and lower co- Insurance um but
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
again at the end of the day um if drug
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturers really want to make their
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
drugs more affordable for patients um
 
01:57:03.629 --> 01:57:03.639 align:start position:0%
then the solution is very easy they
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
should lower their drug prices for
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
everyone um so we would put the question
 
01:57:09.119 --> 01:57:10.390 align:start position:0%
everyone um so we would put the question
to

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
them and thank you very much for your
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that we'll close the
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
555 and start 55 seven as quickly as
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
possible do we have do we have a system
 
01:57:31.229 --> 01:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
to let Senator Apprentice know we're
 
01:57:31.239 --> 01:57:34.430 align:start position:0%
to let Senator Apprentice know we're
ready

01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
is I see another card heading its way
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay when we get started uh sorry about
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
the delay Senator not a problem thank
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
you very much and uh I I appreciate the
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity once again to be before our

committee to introduce legislation this
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
is Senate Bill 557 this prohibits
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
discriminatory actions against entities
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
that are participating in the 340b drug
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
pricing program um and so starting off
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
with just talking a little bit about the
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
340b program and I know I have one maybe
 
01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
two folks here with me that um have
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
direct experience with this in New
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and can talk why putting these
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
Protections in place is important but
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
according to the americ American
 
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association for more than 30
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
years the 340b drug pricing program has
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
provided financial help to hospitals
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
serving vulnerable communities to manage
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
Rising prescription drug costs so
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
section 340b of the Public Health
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
Service act requires pharmaceutical
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers participating in Medicaid
 
01:58:59.310 --> 01:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
to sell outpatient drugs at discounted
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
prices to Health Care organizations that
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
care for many uninsured and lowincome
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
patients these organizations include
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
Federal grantee organizations such as
 
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
certain types of hospitals our critical
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
access hospitals our federally qualified
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
rural Health Centers sole Community
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hospitals rural referral centers really
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we're talking most
 
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
about critical access hospitals and the
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers but
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
they serve U this disproportionate share
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
of low income and IND you know or IND
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
IND oh I know I'm so sorry I uh had a
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
late flight and have not had enough
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
coffee so please excuse me um Indigent
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
populations um so this program allows
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
340b hospitals to stretch their limited
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
Federal resources to reduce the price of
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals for patients and expand
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
services to the patients and communities
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
that they serve hospitals under 340b the
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
savings that can provide for other
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
programs that also serve the uninsured
 
02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
or Indigent population um in terms of
 
02:00:10.119 --> 02:00:11.149 align:start position:0%
or Indigent population um in terms of
free

02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines care services in mental health
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
clinics and Implement medication
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
management and community health programs
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
so the money they save by participating
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
in 340b they can transfer ref to other
 
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
effort efforts that support this
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
particular population so according to
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
hersa our health sources Health
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
Resources and services ad Administration
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
which is the federal entity uh which is
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering the 340b
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
program enrolled hospitals and other
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
covered entities can achieve an average
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
savings of 25 to 50% in pharmaceutical
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
purchases despite significant oversight
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
from hersa this program's proven record
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
of decreasing governmental spending and
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
expanding access to Patient Care um some
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
want to limit that by scaling this back
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle of it or
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
drastically reducing the benefits that
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
eligible hospitals and their patients
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
receive from the program so that is why
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
a number of states uh one of the states
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
I was recently reading about was Nevada
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
have adopted laws that don't allow for
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
any discriminatory practices to get in
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of this particular program so
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
I am as always happy to take questions
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
that you have if I don't have the the
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
answer I can either get it for you or
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
have somebody behind me who has more
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
experience actually administering this
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
program speak to you and um I was just
 
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
saying to someone that I feel like I'm
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
here more than I'm at Health and Human
 
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
Services so this is a good year all
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
right thank yes we do things a little
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
differently on the Senate you just from
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate no no I'm talking about like
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
I've been before your committee lately
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
three times in the last two weeks it's
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
all good so so um who's doing the
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
Discrimination who I mean what what a
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
problem we solving here who so one of
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
one of the um you know and respectfully
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question chair hunt
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
U Pharmacy there's you know Pharmacy
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
benefit managers who can be in the
 
02:02:02.430 --> 02:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
middle of the pharmaceutical companies
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
um I was pharmaceutical companies
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um and insurers there's
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
they can get in the middle of this um
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
and actually Implement a policy that
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
might say limit where somebody can
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
actually access these particular
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
medications so do you know if that's
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
true here in New Hampshire that some
 
02:02:21.229 --> 02:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company or some people do not
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
know that if it's true but we're trying
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent it from happening based on
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
what's happening in other states and I
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
would look to um I know that this has
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
happened in other states and that's why
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
states are adopting this this is a
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
proactive measure um and folks from um
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
Dart withth Health that are here that
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%

benefits thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm very grateful for the
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in support of this
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory bill on the 340b
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
program as Matthew mentioned I am the
 
02:03:58.990 --> 02:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
director of the 340b program for the
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health System um but most
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm a pharmacist I've been a
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacist for 20 years and this program
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I've been involved in um not only
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth but at another Health
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
System um since 2013 has been one of the
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
most rewarding experiences in my entire
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
career um and that's why I'm here today
 
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
to speak about why it's so important and
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
and get your support
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
um as you are probably aware the 340b
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
program is a federal program designed to
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
stretch scarce Federal resources as far
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
as possible reaching more eligible
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
patients and to provide more
 
02:04:33.719 --> 02:04:35.109 align:start position:0%
patients and to provide more
comprehensive

02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
services so under this program drug
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturers offer their products to
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
covered entities at a discounted price
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
if they wish to have their products
 
02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
reimburse by Medicare and Medicaid and
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
so that's really at the heart right um
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
and so as consumers of healthc care I
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
imagine that you go to your local
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacy you pick up your
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptions um at Dartmouth health and
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
other 34b programs across the state of
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um they enter in with
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
contracts with these local pharmacies to
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
help procure medications through this
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
program with the involvement of the
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
covered entity so that these medications
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
can get in patients hands this
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
contractual Arrangement allows patients
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
to pick up their prescriptions at these
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
local pharmacies so that the eligible
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
entity May capture
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
savings and these savings are not
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
additional right the the number of
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
prescriptions a covered entity can write
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
is finite and so these contract
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
relationships allow us to capture where
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
our patients are being
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
served manufacturers started to prohibit
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
the use of contract pharmacies for 340b
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
discounts in 2020 it is rapidly and
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
aggressively gotten very worse for us to
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
be able to capture those savings due to
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
um almost 30 manufacturers now with
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
different policies and they continue be
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
to become uh less inclusive as the years
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
have gone
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
on patients do have the right to choose
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
where they receive their medical care
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
and so where we're able to really
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
benefit the 340b program is through our
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
retail specialty at mail order
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacies we can't solely just use that
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
though because of our rural environment
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
and expect a patient to drive to to our
 
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy when they may be already coming
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to our services that are an hour or two
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
hours away so that's why we want to
 
02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
embark on these contracts with our local
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacies across the state um some
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
patients do opt for mail order if the
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
distance is too great um and then
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore they may be required by the
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
PBM to use mail order pharmacies um
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
across the US and in Arizona and even in
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
California Dartmouth Health has patients
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
getting care in Pharmaceuticals shipped
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire from all the way across
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
the country some of these Pharma
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are stating we can't
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
embark on contract phes out of a 40 m
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
radius of our covered entity and in our
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
rural environment that's just not
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
feasible so there is a need to continue
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain contract pharmacies to
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
enable our covered entity to capture
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
those savings uh for those patients who
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
are mandated to choose other services or
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
who have the right to choose where they
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
want to go within our great state so we
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
talk about 340b savings and so I wanted
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
to share what Dartmouth health does
 
02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
beyond charity care um with the use of
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the 340b savings that we're able to to
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
to realize so I did mention that we have
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
our our system of retail pharmacies and
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
so patients who are underinsured or
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
discharged may get re admitted due to
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
the costs of these newer drug therapies
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be news to anyone in this
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
room many patients who are insured have
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
those large deductibles and can't afford
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
those medications um and so they return
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
to the hospital for complications due
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
and not being able to afford those
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
therapies our pharmacies offer a full
 
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
medication discount list um and this
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
does include discounted medications to
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
all so my father from the state of New
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
York if he was admitted he can go into
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
that pharmacy and get that medication at
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
that lower discounted rate so it's not
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
just for patients that are members or uh
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
patients of our of our health
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
system I think that's really the most
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
important point of how we use that at
 
02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
our own
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacies another thing that we do with
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
the 340b savings is we support the
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
treatment of over 200 hemophilia and
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
other bleeding disorder patients with
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
life-saving and critical therapies um
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
benefits there include nurse management
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
care coordination Community Based
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%

and mental health support with this
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
disease um patients are living longer
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
and longer with hemophilia um and so the
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
better they can treat themselves the
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
better they'll be we also support
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%

the Dartmouth Cancer Center food bank

program for those with opioid use
 
02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
disorder and we are constantly opening
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
new service lines um especially notable
 
02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:48.559 align:start position:0%
is an Express Care Clinic at New London
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital that um was filling a gap in
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
that community
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
and so just to close contract Pharmacy
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
is incredibly vital and we need to
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
maintain the hersa uh allowance of
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
letting us have those relationships with
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
whatever pharmacies need to be able to
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
care for our patients um and our system
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacies are just not able to care for
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
them all and so by Contracting where our
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
patients are are going um or located
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
where they live we can bring that
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
savings back and continue to fund
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives as mentioned um you know
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
like the medication discount list the
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
opioid treatment mental health all the
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that are are Forefront in our
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
minds and we want to continue to support
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
Community initiatives in the state of
 
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.069 align:start position:0%

manufacturers who exited this uh program
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming and I I'm pretty sure uh a
 
02:10:57.629 --> 02:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
lot of their patents uh were funded by
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh the federal government what is your
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
exactly your question has anybody
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
thought of uh bringing litigation and to
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%

02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
system thank you for the question
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%

02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
both the federal and state levels
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the 34b program 25 states
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
have initiated legislation on the state
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
level to navigate
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
the the contract Pharmacy space five of
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
which have um enacted legislation to

quickly and even though I'm from New
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
York I couldn't keep up
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
ior um that's probably why I talk so
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
quickly uh you said uh farma has been uh
 
02:11:52.990 --> 02:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
instrumental in trying to shut these
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
programs down can you elaborate on that
 
02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit yes so in 2020 Eli Lily um
 
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
started with the Restriction um by uh
 
02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
saying that covered entities couldn't
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
access the 340b drug pricing uh point on
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
their drug Calis from that point um
 
02:12:11.229 --> 02:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
other manufacturers jumped in and said
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
contract Pharmacy uh price points would
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
not be available to covered entities um
 
02:12:19.069 --> 02:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
mostly this is due to I think
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
some language in the action ual statute
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
that they are leveraging to use this as
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
um a way to not allow uh to provide that
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
340b price point um there's a long
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
pathway of the restrictions and how they
 
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
have become tighter um but basically
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's gone from One Drug to the scope of
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
drugs to um no contract pharmacies then
 
02:12:47.549 --> 02:12:47.559 align:start position:0%
they asked us to report data uh we did
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
report data and as soon as we did that
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
after a year um a good hunk of them I
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
would say about nine or 10 of those
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturers decided that uh we didn't
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
need to submit data anymore and that
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
they were not going to extend pricing
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
anymore um so it's just progressively
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
gotten worse since
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
2020 so that that's the kind of
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
interference that you want this bill to
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
try and fix correct thank you Mr
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
chairman may I just add very briefly for
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
the committee this is a fairly
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
narrow um response to the scope of
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
issues that covered entities and far pH
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
ceutical manufacturers and pbms are
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
navigating this purely pertains to the
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
contract uh
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy eligibility for the program
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
right but the reality it's a federal
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
program so technically it doesn't have
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
too much force of law but we want to
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
send the message that we do not want
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
them to continue to discriminate when it
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
comes to this Federal wonderful Federal
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
program that is a Marvel that Congress
 
02:13:49.709 --> 02:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
ever passed it in the first place and um
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes and in New Hampshire we would want
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
to send that message and be clear about
 
02:13:56.350 --> 02:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
what can and cannot be included exactly
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
McCracken from AMS gag health and
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
support of the bill good morning or
 
02:14:09.559 --> 02:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
support of the bill good morning or
afternoon

02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
now you have to push the button on there
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
you go that
 
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
better thank you very much uh chairman
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
hunt and members of the house Commerce
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs committee I'm going
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
to try and skip over a lot of things
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
because you've already heard them so I'm
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to just jump to a little bit a
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
little more practical application so I
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
work at amamos Health we federally
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Center we have about
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
16,000 active patients in the greater
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester area and we're a 340b covered
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
entity right so this impacts us in a big
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
way and we're able to do the same thing
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that Dartmouth talked about about using
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
the savings from that program to benefit
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
our our patients and I'm going to tell
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
you a story about a a real patient right
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
so we have uh a individual who um lost
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
her U permanent employment took a
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
position as a consultant for a period of
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
time didn't have insurance and had
 
02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
regular medications that she needed to
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
take she was a little more than the
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level so she didn't
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
qualify to get any covered benefits but
 
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
she need did regularly to take her
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
medication so she used our 340b program
 
02:15:29.549 --> 02:15:29.559 align:start position:0%
to buy the medicines at a significantly
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
reduced cost that she never would have
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
been able to buy on her own so some of
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
the medications might cost $200 or $300
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
for a one month supply and if any of you
 
02:15:43.709 --> 02:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
have um individuals in your home who are
 
02:15:45.629 --> 02:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
aging and are taking medication
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
regularly you know how those costs can
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
add up but we're able to provide a
 
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
formulary for this individual and buy
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
these medications for them with a very
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
discounted price so we have a $4
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
formulary and a $12 formulary and that's
 
02:16:03.149 --> 02:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
very affordable so there's really great
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
things that this program does but when
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
they try and limit where you can offer
 
02:16:10.589 --> 02:16:10.599 align:start position:0%
this service and how many pharmacies can
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
cover this service for you makes it
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult to do the right
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
thing by the patients that you're trying
 
02:16:20.109 --> 02:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
to serve so I am very much in support of
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
this um it's no cost to anybody in New
 
02:16:27.149 --> 02:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um no cost to taxpayers the
 
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
discounts are provided by the
 
02:16:31.629 --> 02:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies themselves so
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
as she noted to you this has been under
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
attack since 2020 and I think one of my
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
colleagues from another federally
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Center is going to talk
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
to you about the real impact for us over
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
over the period of the time that this
 
02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
has happened we've gone from a
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
significant level maybe $1 million down
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
to less than $500,000 in savings that's
 
02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
part of how we support the care that we
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
provide to people who are Indigent so
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
this is a huge impact and who's going to
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
cover that who's going to close that Gap
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers aren going to close that Gap
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
we need we need to take advantage of
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
something that was designed specifically
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
for this purpose to help the people that
 
02:17:16.509 --> 02:17:16.519 align:start position:0%
are most in need and the
 
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
predatory um aspect of what was kicked
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
off by Eli Libby is having having a
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
really deleterious effect on a lot of
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
your safety net providers so we
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
sincerely hope that you'll consider um
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
supporting this and helping us do what
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
we can to protect this program and the
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
people that it serves thank
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much got one card
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
left uh Ed Shin Shala
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
sh was very good from AMS Community
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
Health Services thank you I I want to
 
02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
thank Chris as a colleague and um the
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
patient she speaks of are in a
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
Manchester area um and have uniquely
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
Urban challenges um I'm the CEO of AMC
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
Community Health Services in the North
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
Country we have 26 towns in our service
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
area there are 30,000 residents and we
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
see roughly one in three of our friends
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
family and neighbors to do that we've
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
strategically located five care delivery
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
SE sites from the north of Whitefield
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
down through through Littleton Franconia
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
come down 302 to Woodsville and then cut
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
across 25 uh to our Mount musaki Health
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Center which has actually been a health
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
center since 1957 so we're proud to
 
02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
continue that Heritage so when we think
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
about the restrictions we've had
 
02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
economically it represents a 70 some per
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
reduction in the
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
savings um over in there's a chart that
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
I've given you you can track that uh
 
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
since 2017 most significantly as was
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned with Eli Lily with a
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
restriction in um the pharmacies we can
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
use and I think one of the things I've
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
enjoyed about New Hampshire is we try to
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
be regulator light and if I would like
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
to do business with representative hunt
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
um that's free market we can have a
 
02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
conversation come to terms of what that
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
looks like depending on services and and
 
02:19:19.469 --> 02:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
money's rendered so I I I take exception
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
that um someone from not in New
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is infringed on my ability to
 
02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
care for our patients and and and have
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
free trade amongst the pharmacies to
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
which I would like to do business with
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
when we look at the
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
access um which one Pharmacy am I going
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
to pick for my
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
patients if I pick the Walmarts there's
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
one in Littleton there's one in
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville there's one in Plymouth which
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
patients do I tell do I tell Whitefield
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
well if you want meds you got to go to
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth do I tell Warren you have to go
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
to to Littleton so it's created an
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
access issue um independent of the
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
economics and when we think about taking
 
02:19:58.880 --> 02:19:59.950 align:start position:0%
economics and when we think about taking
our

02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
medications uh that we look at taking
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
our blood pressure medications those are
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
important to prevent stroke and to
 
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
prevent heart attacks and if we start
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
heading down a stroke and heart attack
 
02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
Road um it's not a good experience the
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh qu outcomes are not guaranteed in we
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
an emergency department
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh $750 to $1,500 a hospital day is
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
$2,000 ICU is $10,000 and our Primary
 
02:20:32.349 --> 02:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
Care is $200 and uh blood pressure
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
medications are pretty affordable and
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
especially with our sliding fee scale
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
that we fund with a 340b they're even
 
02:20:40.110 --> 02:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
more affordable so there there's a
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
significant Downstream economic impact
 
02:20:44.429 --> 02:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
bad experience can't guarantee you're
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to survive this which is tragic
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
and it's not inexpensive and it was
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
completely avoidable as long as people
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
from out of state don't tell us how to
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
do business in New Hampshire um so when
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
we look at our savings in addition to
 
02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
the the 340b investment into affordable
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
medications the Health Care system is
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
complex anybody who's I work in it and I
 
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
I still am challenged to sit down and
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
figure out when I'm a patient how to do
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
it so we have patient Navigators that
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
help people address food security
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation so they can get the
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
appointments sit down and sort through
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the Myriad of insurance possibilities so
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
they can make smart Intelligent
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
Decisions and then we also put it into
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
oral health and currently we collaborate
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
with Midstate uh we provide the physical
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
plant they provide the staff uh and
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've matched our voucher to the $1,500
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid uh to make it easy so uh
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
Midstate has a sliding fee scale for
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
dental we have a voucher and New
 
02:21:46.110 --> 02:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid so I think we've done
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
a nice job collectively wrapping around
 
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
people uh to make sure they have good
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
dentition uh so more than willing to
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
field any questions on this but just
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
ability to increase access to patients
 
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
going back to be able to choose which
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacies we want to do business with
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
um and it's really based we follow the
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
patient you know if a patient doesn't go
 
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
there we don't contract with them so I I
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time um and your
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
interest in this area we try to keep
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
your friends family and neighbors um as
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
healthy as we can thank you
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service rep represent
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
believe you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:22:30.429 --> 02:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what the question
 
02:22:30.439 --> 02:22:33.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what the question
do

02:22:33.070 --> 02:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
you do you deal with the pbms we do um
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then in the in the testimony I
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
believe that I documented we had an
 
02:22:41.479 --> 02:22:42.710 align:start position:0%
believe that I documented we had an
in-house

02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and due to what I would
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
consider I'll take the ad due to the
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
contract we were provided because we
 
02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
contract we were provided because we
were

02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
340b uh covered entity we got a contract
 
02:22:57.550 --> 02:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
different than if we had not been and
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
what that means is we're an open
 
02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacy so if you're our
 
02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
patient we behave within 340b if we not
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
we still get you your medication but we
 
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
have to purchase it at 80% of average
 
02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:08.670 align:start position:0%
have to purchase it at 80% of average
wholesale

02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
price the contract was taking a piece of
 
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
the savings so we lost savings on our
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
patient but they took so much savings
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
that if you're not our patient we
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
actually lost money we couldn't even
 
02:23:23.950 --> 02:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
break even on that uh I was taught that
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
you can re-engineer and not hurt
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
people's lives so I worked with
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
Littleton Regional Hospital when we
 
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
closed our Pharmacy they opened a retail
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
and they have a wonderful meds to beds
 
02:23:35.269 --> 02:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
program if your hospital doesn't please
 
02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
have them contact me you leave with your
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
medications uh so when I had my hip done
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
I left with a blood thinner and an
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
antibiotic and I went home with a bag of
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
ice uh my wife didn't have to leave me
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot or God forbid leave
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
me home alone which is never a good idea
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
idea um so that that that was very
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
frustrating we now have a pharmacy on
 
02:23:59.950 --> 02:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
site it's Genoa it's a strategic partner
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so I didn't give up patients have
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
access it's just not my Pharmacy um but
 
02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:04.910 align:start position:0%
access it's just not my Pharmacy um but
that

02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:07.269 --> 02:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
was predatory
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
Contracting um very frustrating thank
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
you see no more questions we thank you
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
and having no more cars I will close the
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 557 and
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%

right indeed it is actually so let me
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill this is Senate Bill
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
196 and um this bill was brought forward
 
03:16:51.070 --> 03:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
um because there were some issues
 
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
initially regarding the interpretation
 
03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
of Statute by the department of
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
insurance as it applies to ride share
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
companies like uber and Lyft um however
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
the companies and the department have
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
agreed on an interpretation of Statute
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
and at this point the bill is no longer
 
03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
necessary therefore I ask the committee

03:28:18.269 --> 03:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
senor Fon thank you for having me folks
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
happy be in front of
 
03:28:22.429 --> 03:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I am
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Donovan Fenton I represent
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
district 10 and I'll be very brief I'm
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
here before you today to introduce
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 325 which would establish a
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee to study the issue of
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
insurance appraiser
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
licensing the reason for this bill is
 
03:28:40.269 --> 03:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
that we are seeing a disconnect between
 
03:28:43.150 --> 03:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
the damage appraisal of vehicles and
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
what is actually going to cost to fix
 
03:28:47.950 --> 03:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
the car Auto damage cost analysis has
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
been has become highly skilled and
 
03:28:52.590 --> 03:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
because because cars are for far more
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
complicated now the cars also have to be
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
rebuilt to spec and meet manufacturer
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
guidelines you don't want your car to be
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
rebuilt missing things in some cases we
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
are seeing underpayment of the actual
 
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
loss what that means is the AO Body Shop
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
does the work to make the car new but
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
the payment for the damage said um you
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't need to adhere to certain
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
specifications so who is right question
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
one way to fix this is to look at
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
license insurance appraisers this way
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
the appraisers are not potentially
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
influenced by who the insurance are who
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
hire them and this is a study committee
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any more questions you
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
have we do have a question
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs thanks for
 
03:29:35.150 --> 03:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator why a
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee which a lot of us don't feel
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
go anywhere a lot of times versus a
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill well studying committees are thank
 
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
you for the question study committees
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
are important um you know I think uh
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's a complex issue there's a lot of
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved and I think we
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
want to hear everyone's um everyone's
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
side of things before you make this bill
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um you know you're going to hear a lot
 
03:29:58.469 --> 03:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
from the autobodies auto body shops are
 
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
small independent owned oftentimes
 
03:30:02.110 --> 03:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're small family businesses
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
generational businesses and I think we
 
03:30:05.309 --> 03:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
should do everything in our power to
 
03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
help them um and this bill was written
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
um with the Department of Insurance you
 
03:30:12.269 --> 03:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
know we wrote it together a lot of uh a
 
03:30:15.550 --> 03:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
lot of uh parts of this and um you know
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
AO body work has changed drastically I'm
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
not sure if any of you have gotten you
 
03:30:21.030 --> 03:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
know work done in your vehicle before
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
but now you use specialized tools and
 
03:30:25.389 --> 03:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
equipment and software so it's a it's a
 
03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
very intricate profession
 
03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
now yeah so um I have to admit I was
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
reading this bill and I I I did not
 
03:30:38.590 --> 03:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
realize it's about utob body because it
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't say Autobot so we have a
 
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:43.469 align:start position:0%
doesn't say Autobot so we have a
licensing

03:30:43.469 --> 03:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:30:46.349 --> 03:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
of insurance appraisers we have a
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
license for this are you asking if we
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
have it now yeah not though I not
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
independently not that's not what I
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand no oh so we have no lure of
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
appr independent appraisers correct and
 
03:31:00.910 --> 03:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
then A and B is because this is kind of
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
open-ended and but you want it to be
 
03:31:05.830 --> 03:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
only for
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
Autobody no I mean first of all Mr chair
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions um not
 
03:31:11.910 --> 03:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily only auto body that's the
 
03:31:14.349 --> 03:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
impetus of the bill uh this is strictly
 
03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with independent appraisers
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
damage independent so that means they're
 
03:31:27.070 --> 03:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
not working for an insurance company
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
they are but they're not employed by the
 
03:31:31.150 --> 03:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company think of it as like a
 
03:31:34.110 --> 03:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
1099 that's the way I understand it okay
 
03:31:37.630 --> 03:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
so they're they're hire hired by the the
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
insurance comp to the okay oh boy all
 
03:31:43.710 --> 03:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
right well I I did th the study
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee I did not get that when I read
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
this s Comm but now I get it all right
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:31:59.400 --> 03:31:59.410 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.410 --> 03:32:01.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:32:01.630 --> 03:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
melier would you
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
believe in November is it your mic on
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you would you believe in November
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
I hit a deer with my
 
03:32:17.950 --> 03:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
car oh dear and the initial appraiser
 
03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
appraisal came in for like it was
 
03:32:23.189 --> 03:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
$8,000 I got my car back eight weeks
 
03:32:25.550 --> 03:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
later and the final bill was
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
$28,000 so a big big difference thank
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
you I I would believe we you know um
 
03:32:33.750 --> 03:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of right a passage if you hit
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
a deer in New Hampshire it seems like um
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and I will say this you know there's
 
03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
no reason to be opposed to a study
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this disconnect you
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
know just like what you said the this
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
stuff is happening you just heard
 
03:32:47.910 --> 03:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony uh or question I should say
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
about you know uh the disconnect between
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
an appraisal what you know what someone
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
else says so I think uh looking a little
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.479 --> 03:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
yes so what the way I'm understanding is
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
this have a study committee so and what
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking at is having independent
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't and the committee could
 
03:33:11.070 --> 03:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
find that companies could have their own
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
appraisers this would just be an
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
independent appraiser correct I think
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
spear I'm not exactly sure who to
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
address this to how would this study
 
03:33:29.309 --> 03:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
committee get started I mean is it
 
03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
looking for volunteers I don't know how
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
they work oh okay yes we'll talk about
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
how a study committee work if you'd like
 
03:33:38.830 --> 03:33:38.840 align:start position:0%

03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
the cables of Toyotas all the time and
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
you should just call your insurance
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
company and have them pay for it well
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
you bu you buy a new car you get a mouse
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
with it you know that's what you do you
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
send them home with
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
it I have a quick question okay oh re
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
prelli yes thank you thank you for
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm just help me
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
understand why you think licensing
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance appraisers might help this
 
03:35:48.429 --> 03:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
issue what is your thinking sure
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
so you know we're looking at just
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
studying the issue because there's
 
03:35:54.670 --> 03:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
clearly a disconnect you know I've heard
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
from a lot of auto body shops and
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's actually some auto body shops
 
03:35:58.630 --> 03:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
behind me that you're going to hear from
 
03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
as well um and I think they can describe
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
the issues and problems they're facing a
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
little better than I can because they
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
live this day-to- day after you know
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
they spend time with the insurance
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
companies these appraisers uh that's
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
part of their job because they're
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
valuing the damage on the vehicle how
 
03:36:17.229 --> 03:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
much it cost to fix labor costs things
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
like that um so I think you know a way
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
and having these conversations with the
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
auto body shops and um individuals in
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies that you know
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps these individual uh appraisers
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a disconnect there and
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why we need licensing for
 
03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
these individual uh appraisers I don't
 
03:36:38.830 --> 03:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
know if that answered your question kind
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%

we do not regulate Insurance appraisers
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%

office for help they told me that they
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%

calibrations and whatnot right up front
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%

just go on
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
daily if the insurance department did
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
their job we wouldn't be here
 
03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
today got another appraisal here uh that
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
this was a fairly new Toyota 4Runner
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
1500 customer told me their truck is
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
over at the GM dealer I went over and
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
looked at it the uh last
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
week Geico will fight tooth and nailed
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
not to pay the shops but body labor
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
rates or the repair procedures that GM
 
03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
rates or the repair procedures that GM
requires

03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
the GM dealer can just write a oneline
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
or Geico can put on their appraisal a
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
oneline estimate they'll pay 115 bucks
 
03:41:54.319 --> 03:41:55.309 align:start position:0%
oneline estimate they'll pay 115 bucks
for

03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:41:57.750 --> 03:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
labor but when it comes to the body shop
 
03:41:59.830 --> 03:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
labor 60
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
bucks what is funny is some of this
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
labor that they included in here from
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
the dealership my shop completed for the
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
dealership because the dealership
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it but since a dealership
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
build it
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
out the insurance company will included
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
on their apprais appraisal when it comes
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
won't the repair
 
03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
procedures all the appraisers have
 
03:42:28.990 --> 03:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
access to them if they don't have access
 
03:42:30.269 --> 03:42:30.279 align:start position:0%
to the repair procedures from the
 
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle manufacturers then they
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing appraisals these cars
 
03:42:38.149 --> 03:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
are computers rolling computers
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
they're got so much technology built
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
into them and the insurance appraisers
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
either a they're stupid
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
or they're just taken upon themselves
 
03:42:51.750 --> 03:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
with or taking directions from their
 
03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
do to underwrite the value of the the uh
 
03:43:01.950 --> 03:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
damages Insurance appraisers should be
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
appraising vehicles that is it they
 
03:43:08.030 --> 03:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
should not be adjusting losses for the
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies Insurance appraisers
 
03:43:13.590 --> 03:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh apprais Vehicles according to
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner n hand that's
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
what he told me on a a phone
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversation and adjusters adjust claims
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
what is happening nowadays is the
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
insurance customers of these independent
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
appraisers are being provided guidelines
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh pricing structures of how to uh value
 
03:43:34.990 --> 03:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
these damaged
 
03:43:38.830 --> 03:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so basically they adjust
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
adjusting the appraisals to the terms
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
and conditions of the insurance contract
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the job of an insurance
 
03:43:49.950 --> 03:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
appraiser a few years
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
back I applied for a part-time position
 
03:43:55.710 --> 03:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
for extra pocket money for one of these
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
third-party appraisal companies an
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
independent appraisal company this
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
company was mainly doing uh handl
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
appraisals and claims for USAA and I got
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
my hands on a copy of the paperwork from
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that appraisal
 
03:44:14.189 --> 03:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
company and if it made me sick what they
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
wanted me to do
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
and how to Value people's you know
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
damaged Vehicles it's fraud what is
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
happening out there is plain fraud and
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire law supports that what
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
I say here the problem is no one wants
 
03:44:33.309 --> 03:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce the loss out there on the
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
books I mean I hate to say be up here
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
asking to start licensing uh independent
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
appraisers but something's got to be
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
done either
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
a the Attorney General's got to do their
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
job B
 
03:44:48.510 --> 03:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance Department's gotta got to
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
start doing
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
something but we shouldn't be up here we
 
03:44:53.950 --> 03:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be seeing the New Hampshire
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance consumers vehicle owners they
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
heard fellow up here saying he his
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
initial estimate was 8,000 bucks then it
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
28 yep I see it every day these
 
03:45:08.429 --> 03:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
Insurance appraisers they'll come out
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
they'll write five six 10 eight
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
different appraisals they'll start off
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
at a th000 bucks next thing you know at
 
03:45:16.830 --> 03:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
the end of the day they're up to 10,000
 
03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
and they still short pay the uh
 
03:45:21.550 --> 03:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
Insurance consumer another three or four
 
03:45:24.030 --> 03:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
grand I got a I got a couple appraisals
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
here from Liberty Mutual they're famous
 
03:45:27.630 --> 03:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
for it they don't want to send anybody
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
out to look at their car they don't want
 
03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:29.950 align:start position:0%
out to look at their car they don't want
any

03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
appraisers and and they call their
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
paperwork appraisals and the insurance
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
department considers them
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
appraisals and and it's not uncommon for
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
them to have five six seven eight
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
appraisals go from a thousand bucks to
 
03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
eight to 10 to $10,000
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
world very frustrating as a a consumer
 
03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:54.790 align:start position:0%
world very frustrating as a a consumer
seeing

03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
myself yearly monthly take money out of
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
my pocket to pay and get my cars fixed
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then to see my my uh Body Shop
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.189 --> 03:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
question so you've been around ke your
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
whole life yep and we all have long
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
memories and so my question to you is
 
03:46:32.710 --> 03:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
would you liken this situation to the
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
good old days bad old days maybe when
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
you went to Keen Co-op and they gave you
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
alone and made the appraisal fit the
 
03:46:43.149 --> 03:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
amount of money you needed before
 
03:46:45.070 --> 03:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
appraisers real estate appraisers were
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
licensed is this that same situation
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
except they're doing it in reverse where
 
03:46:52.030 --> 03:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
they're underpricing the cost because
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're trying to save the entity money
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
is it similar to that and should the
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
these appraisers be licensed like real
 
03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
estate appraisers or is this a different
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
scenario pretty much the same thing you
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
know I had a loss on one of my homes uh
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
three years ago Foundation collaps into
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
the lake insurance company sent the uh
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
their appraiser out they determined it
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
was not not
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
on but at least the appraiser had some
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
ethics you know that came out and these
 
03:47:28.510 --> 03:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
appraisers that come out here to look at
 
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicles there's no ethics or anything
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about them
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
undervaluing claims we have the a
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
appraiser here that for Vermont mutual
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
and conquered group Hill inflate claims
 
03:47:44.189 --> 03:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
too to pun to punish the consumer the
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle owner and the body shop for
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
instance we repaired a fairly new
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hyundai in the last couple months
 
03:47:54.790 --> 03:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
probably two months ago quot at roughly
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
nine grand to fix
 
03:48:00.149 --> 03:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
it but since we and my
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
customer wouldn't agree to their labor
 
03:48:06.189 --> 03:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
rates that he wrote up wrote up an

03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
front for the customer to pick up he was
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
going to make up the difference
 
03:48:17.070 --> 03:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
but the insurance company says no don't
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%

Association um I think uh the prior
 
03:50:43.950 --> 03:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
speaker has given you a good taste of
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
what a study committee would be like on
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
the issue of Licensing
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
appraisers and um if you want to hear
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
more of the same then um you can go
 
03:50:57.229 --> 03:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
ahead and serve on the on the committee
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
and I would interrupt my short summer to
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
be present to listen to some of the
 
03:51:08.429 --> 03:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
testimony and offer another view but um
 
03:51:12.990 --> 03:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
let me just say that um a few things
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
about what appraisers do what insurance
 
03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
adjusters do and what insurance
 
03:51:20.469 --> 03:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
companies do uh with respect to uh
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
adjusting losses and then you can decide
 
03:51:25.710 --> 03:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
whether you think it's worth you know
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
studying the possibility of Licensing
 
03:51:32.670 --> 03:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
appraisers um uh first of all appraisers
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
are hired by insurance companies to put
 
03:51:37.229 --> 03:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
a value on property and there's
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
appraisers that uh work with personal
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
property artwork or jewelry or equipment
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
or other things that are insured and
 
03:51:49.229 --> 03:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
that are the subject of loss as well as
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh real property uh damage to roofs or
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
anything else with respect to the
 
03:51:57.149 --> 03:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
property and also again and that's what
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're here today I think to talk about
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
although the bill is broader than that
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
uh automobile insurance losses and
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
so they are not licensed but claims
 
03:52:10.189 --> 03:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
adjusters are
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
licensed uh they are the persons who by
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
by Statute it's RSA
 
03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
402b uh investigate negotiate or settle
 
03:52:22.189 --> 03:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
property casualty claims that's what a
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
does Insurance appraisers work for
 
03:52:28.600 --> 03:52:29.590 align:start position:0%
does Insurance appraisers work for
claims

03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
claims
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
adjusters and their job is
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
to obtain facts surrounding a claim or
 
03:52:38.910 --> 03:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
to furnish technical assistance to a
 
03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
licensed adjuster so that's that's how
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
the system works and appraises under the
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh claims adjuster statute are not
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed so what happens
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
if a claims uh
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
appraiser does a poor
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
job let's say unethical as the prior
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
speaker suggests they all are uh or
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
incompetent as they apparently all are
 
03:53:11.070 --> 03:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
as well well then that appraiser is
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
responsible to the adjuster who adjusted
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
the loss the adjuster is licens the
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
adjuster is the one who will be called
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
upon to make that claim right and
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore the insurance company that
 
03:53:25.229 --> 03:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
employs the claims at
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
Jer is licensed by the department and
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
subject to the laws of the of insurance
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
as is the public adjuster including the
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
consumer prot the unfair Trade Practices
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
Act that governs the conduct of
 
03:53:43.229 --> 03:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment of these claims and a rule
 
03:53:45.790 --> 03:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
that goes into a great detail about what
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities are of the company
 
03:53:52.990 --> 03:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the adjuster to treat consumers
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
fairly when they have claims so uh some
 
03:53:58.110 --> 03:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
of I know this is familiar to some of
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman you've been through and
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
some of you've also been through this
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
sort of issue before where uh what it's
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
when you strip it all down there are
 
03:54:12.870 --> 03:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
some auto body shops who believe they
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
should be paid more uh for the work that
 
03:54:16.279 --> 03:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
should be paid more uh for the work that
they

03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
do um and
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh that is really nothing to do with
 
03:54:26.429 --> 03:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
this what this bill is about licensing
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
appraises isn't going to have any effect
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
on what uh uh what the adjustment of the
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
loss is which is again the insurance
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
adjuster that that does that under the
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh Authority granted to the adjusted by
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
the insurance company but just to
 
03:54:43.479 --> 03:54:44.910 align:start position:0%
the insurance company but just to
briefly

03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh go over what this this law is is
 
03:54:48.120 --> 03:54:49.149 align:start position:0%
uh go over what this this law is is
welldeveloped

03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
welldeveloped
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
as and has been around uh since the
 
03:54:55.630 --> 03:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
invention of the automobile the the
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
because automobiles have been involved
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
in accidents and people have uh dealt
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
with the issue of how to uh how to
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
respond to those accidents and
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of insurance companies
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
to do so so under the law if a
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
automobile is damaged it is uh
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
the the insurer is required to bring it
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
to its pre-accident
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
condition uh they are required to use
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
parts that are of like kind of quality
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
the insured is uh has the ability to
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
pick whatever repair facility insured
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
wants to uh go
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
to uh if there's hidden damage that's
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
not disclosed at the first estimate but
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
later disclosed that's obligation of the
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company to pay for the hidden
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
damage uh the law sets forth what the
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
time frames are for the adjustment uh of
 
03:55:57.070 --> 03:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
claims 10 days to respond to a claim and
 
03:55:57.080 --> 03:55:58.189 align:start position:0%
claims 10 days to respond to a claim and
then

03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:56:01.710 --> 03:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
thereafter uh uh time periods to to
 
03:56:05.469 --> 03:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
conduct the uh repair a lot of times now
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
these repairs and it's it's no fault of
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
an insurance company or of the repair
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
shop but these supply chain issues still
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
exist in there's plenty of stories now
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
where uh the parts just aren't available
 
03:56:21.389 --> 03:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
or the the The Body Shop is backed up
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of delays still in
 
03:56:26.510 --> 03:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
repair of vehicles but again that's
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of what I read this uh
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
this bill to uh attempt to
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
address um so if you want to have a
 
03:56:41.830 --> 03:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
study I think that's
 
03:56:45.790 --> 03:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
um not delighted to spend the summer
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
here but uh or even any part of it but
 
03:56:54.189 --> 03:56:54.199 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to uh the the uh Bill CER uh
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
a u a committee to meet within 45 days
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
of the effective date and then to report
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately by its recommendations by
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
November 1 of
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
2024 so my only suggestion to you is
 
03:57:10.590 --> 03:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
that this ground has been covered and
 
03:57:13.510 --> 03:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
and covered in in a great deal of uh
 
03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:15.070 align:start position:0%
and covered in in a great deal of uh
detail

03:57:15.070 --> 03:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
detail
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not optimistic that um a study of
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
this issue is likely to bring about uh
 
03:57:28.590 --> 03:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
any uh change in in policy but again uh
 
03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
if if you want to study it so so be it
 
03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:32.750 align:start position:0%
if if you want to study it so so be it
thank

03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:57:35.389 --> 03:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
you okay representative burough has a
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
question say a would you believe um
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the previous
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
speaker did not disparage all appraisers
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
um and say they were all crooked he was
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
giving examples from his own
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
that seeing n thank you very much thank
 
03:57:58.429 --> 03:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
you uh I thought we were all done but we
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
do have another card here Dan Bennett
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire aor Dealers
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
Association who would like to speak in
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:58:15.309 --> 03:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
members of committee Dan Bennett uh
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
sorry for the late submission was tied
 
03:58:20.469 --> 03:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
up downstairs um nire Dealers
 
03:58:21.870 --> 03:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
Association is a trade Association
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
representing the motor vehicle industry
 
03:58:25.469 --> 03:58:25.479 align:start position:0%
about 500 businesses in New Hampshire
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
about 14,000 employees uh we make up
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
about 24% of the state's retail sales uh
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
we also represent about uh 60 Collision
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
repairers in the state some are
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
associated with franchised uh automobile
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
dealers but many are Independents um I'm
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
proud to say that actually more of our
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
our body shop constituency are
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
independent independent shops um so
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of the bill um see
 
03:58:52.469 --> 03:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh no harm in a in a study committee um
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
and actually some some practical
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
Solutions probably could result that
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
would benefit not only the shops um but
 
03:59:00.910 --> 03:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
also the carriers um and most
 
03:59:02.830 --> 03:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
importantly the consumers if
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
efficiencies um were to be found and
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
gained in the repair um and Appraisal
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
process um obviously vehicles are really
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
complex um you can't do an accurate
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
estimate just by snapping a iPhone
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
picture and emailing it to someone you
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
have to tear the vehicle down get into
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
it and find out what's broken uh hidden
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
structural um stuff so photo estimating
 
03:59:24.990 --> 03:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
is is is problematic for the industry um
 
03:59:27.070 --> 03:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
and it significantly slows down the
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
process by um injecting this
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
supplemental repair um and delaying the
 
03:59:36.030 --> 03:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
cost so um you submit uh for
 
03:59:37.710 --> 03:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and then another one and
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
another one and it significantly slows
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
down the process for their pairer but
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
more importantly for the consumer too
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
and you know if you all are familiar
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
with your automobile insurance policies
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
your rentals only have so many days
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
right so the longer the process goes the
 
03:59:52.990 --> 03:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
more likely you're getting closer to
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you know rental window where it's
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
no longer available and then the
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
consumer has to go to the hip and and
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
pay out of their own pocket so uh if
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's a way to speed up the process
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
speed up the appraisal and estimating
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
thing that's a win-win-win so uh it's
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's our opinion that um this this bill
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
is um is well- intended um and again
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
could yield some positive results for um
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the three-legged stool
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is the carrier the consumer and
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
the repairer so um with that being said
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
we hope you support the bill um and I'll
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
any guess we're all questioned out thank
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you having no more cards I
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on Senate
 
04:00:38.040 --> 04:00:40.309 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on Senate
Bill

04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
325 and since we're a little bit behind
 
04:00:46.910 --> 04:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
schedule we'll move forward to Senate
 
04:00:46.920 --> 04:00:49.550 align:start position:0%
schedule we'll move forward to Senate
Bill

04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.560 --> 04:00:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
137

04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
137
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
and daily is going to uh introduce the
 
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
Lang good afternoon chairman hunt and
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is D
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
Fett and I'm the Senate majority caucus
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
director I'm here to introduce Senate
 
04:01:17.309 --> 04:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 137 FN on behalf of Senator Lang s
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 137 FN is a request of the New
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire craft Brewers Association and
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
the bill would repeal the Nano B license
 
04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
and it would create a four tier
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
licensing and fee structure so domestic
 
04:01:30.189 --> 04:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
sales under 500 barrels per year would
 
04:01:34.269 --> 04:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
be $240 domestic sales of 51 to 2,500
 
04:01:36.590 --> 04:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
barrels per year would be
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
$480 domestic sales of 251 to 15,000
 
04:01:44.189 --> 04:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
barrels per year would be $1,200
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
and domestic sales of more than 15,000
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
per year would be
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
$1,692 so transitioning to an
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
introductory transitioning to an
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
introductory beverage manufacturing tier
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
would likely generate Revenue because
 
04:01:58.870 --> 04:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
lenses would have an option to pay an
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
additional restaurant or satellite fee
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
from an enforcement perspective this
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill would help to simplify rsas and
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
allow for better communication between
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
Brewers and the New Hampshire Liquor
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
Commission the new license structure
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
would allow for small businesses to
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
operate under a standard set of rules
 
04:02:15.630 --> 04:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
and regulations while having them pay a
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
larger fee as they grow and increase
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
their sales this legislation would help
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
bring greater parity to the licensing
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
structure as well as provide a
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
consistent experience for customers
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
going from one location to another the
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
Senate amended the bill to make a small
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
change of the effective date from July
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 to July 1st of

opportunity to speak this afternoon I

speak in favor of this uh legislation uh
 
04:03:17.070 --> 04:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh just kind of highlight a
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
couple items uh CJ Hayes who's our
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
executive director is uh not uh in the
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
state today uh but certainly will be
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
available soon if there are some
 
04:03:26.910 --> 04:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
additional technical information or
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions that folks would have uh the
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
nhba represents 86 independent craft
 
04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
breweries in New Hampshire uh many of
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
which are small and family-owned we have
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
a number of uh Nanos uh brew pubs uh and
 
04:03:44.189 --> 04:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers and uh everyone
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
agrees that this legislation is a a
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
great step forward and the next step uh
 
04:03:51.790 --> 04:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's uh simplification of
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
our of our license fee structure the
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
Nano uh designation has been very
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
popular and successful and has served
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
the industry extremely well and we don't
 
04:04:05.790 --> 04:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
see this as much as a elimination of the
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
Nano as a reclassification of the Nano
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
into a um this tiered structure the fees
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
that were just mentioned
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
are the same fees that are in place now
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
um there are some circumstances where
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
you could have a a current Nano who will
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
end up having to pay a little bit more
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
money uh after this there's some
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
scenarios where you have a beverage
 
04:04:29.469 --> 04:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who will pay a little bit
 
04:04:31.469 --> 04:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
less money uh but as you see in the
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note uh we don't believe that
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be much of a uh a major change
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to uh income uh we do think
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
that this will help simplify this
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
process a lot also allows a a uh a
 
04:04:47.550 --> 04:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
brewer to get into the business at a
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
tier one level uh and then kind of level
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
up as they maybe get more popular or
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're selling more beer uh and move
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
their way up through the structure as
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to starting as a nano having to
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
get a new license type and switch over
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
to a beverage
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh one thing we did want to
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
mention uh when reading it is that we do
 
04:05:11.189 --> 04:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
think there's a small clerical error uh
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
that we would ask the committee to um
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
potentially uh fix for us and this would
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
be on line uh
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
23 and 24 of Page
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
6 uh it mentions uh it puts a annual
 
04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
production uh limit and we believe that
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
that probably should be struck so it
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
currently reads no unopened container
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
sold by a beverage manufacturer license
 
04:05:38.149 --> 04:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
with an annual production under 2500
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
barrels annually shall be opened or
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
consumed on the licens premises um we
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
believe it actually should read no
 
04:05:46.110 --> 04:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
unopened container sold by a beverage
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer license shall be opened or
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
consumed on the license premises and I
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
believe the um New Hampshire Liquor
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
Commission will be able to to speak to
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
this as well um otherwise we um hope to
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
earn the committee's support and we feel
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
like this would be a uh a great step in
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
the right direction for what is a
 
04:06:07.389 --> 04:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
growing uh industry and uh a strong uh
 
04:06:09.149 --> 04:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
part of the New Hampshire economy happy
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions and like I said
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
we have a few Brewers who will be
 
04:06:17.070 --> 04:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
awesome all set thank thank you if you
 
04:06:22.349 --> 04:06:22.359 align:start position:0%

appreciate okay Drew I left let you hang
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
in too long last week so we'll call you
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
up sooner this time yes come on up Drew
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
Klein representing desiah Barlett is
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
talking about how important we need to
 
04:06:35.920 --> 04:06:37.269 align:start position:0%
talking about how important we need to
be

04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
efficient uh Mr chairman I I I see I've
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
testified a lot before this committee
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity and
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'll try to be
 
04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
um pretty brief I want to give you guys
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
the Josiah Bartlet Center with the New
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's free market thing tank and
 
04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
our take on this bill I mean we our
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
mission is to promote Economic
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
Opportunity and prosperity for all
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and we see this as
 
04:06:56.910 --> 04:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
hitting both of those uh from the
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity standpoint and the
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
prosperity standpoint so as some of you
 
04:07:02.830 --> 04:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
know have you've been doing this Brewery
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
legislation for a while um Vermont and
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
Main really got way out way way out
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
ahead of New Hampshire on Craft
 
04:07:12.269 --> 04:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
breweries for decades and we fell way
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
behind and the reason for that was
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh their regulations were better and it
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
was easier to start small breweries and
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
grow them in those two states the
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
creation of the Nano Brewery n plus and
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
micro Brewery licenses back in the day
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
were really really helpful for New
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it really grew New
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Craft brewery industry but
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing that those rigid
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
categories are creating problems for the
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
industry because unlike the other states
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England um our Nano and
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
Nano plus hold uh Brewers in those
 
04:07:45.630 --> 04:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
license categories so if you if you're a
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
startup you want to start small you're
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
locked into that rigid category that's
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
not the case in Maine in Vermont so we
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
went and looked at those uh statutes in
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
Maine in Vermont and it's much much
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
easier to start and grow a beverage
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business there so in Maine
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
for example you get a brewery
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
license which allows the manufacturer of
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
more than 50,000 gallons of beer and
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
they do it by gallon there and a license
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
fee of $1,000 or a small Brewer license
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
which allows you to make up to up to
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
50,000 gallons with a license fee of
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
just 50
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
bucks that's it that's their two
 
04:08:24.309 --> 04:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
categories very easy in
 
04:08:28.590 --> 04:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont they have um slightly different
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
you obtain a beverage manufacturer
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
license for $285 annual fee if you want
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
to then sell beer that you make on
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
premises that's a separate license it's
 
04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
a retail license for 70 bucks then they
 
04:08:42.189 --> 04:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
have other retail licenses for wine and
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
spirits but you're not locked into that
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
startup category whereas in New
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're at a big competitive
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantage if you want to start as a
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
nano or Nano plus and grow unlike in our
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in Northern New
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
England you have to go back and apply
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
for a separate license so it's very
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
burdensome so our breweries are again at
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage to the competitors in
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and it's one of the
 
04:09:10.349 --> 04:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
reasons why in The Craft among craft
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
beer ficient Autos Vermont is actually a
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
pretty legendary state people will
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
travel from Massachusetts through New
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to get to Vermont breweries
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
now thankfully over the last 20 years
 
04:09:22.349 --> 04:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
we've been able to add a lot more craft
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
breweries here but
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
we're the way we regulate them is
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
hindering the growth of the industry so
 
04:09:32.429 --> 04:09:32.439 align:start position:0%
as we look at this we look at uh this
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
particular Bill creating the four tier
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
system boy is it much smoother it's much
 
04:09:38.429 --> 04:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
easier so you can start a business in
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and instead of being
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
locked into that rigid category where
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
you have to go back and apply for a
 
04:09:44.520 --> 04:09:45.710 align:start position:0%
you have to go back and apply for a
separate

04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
license you want to grow great you just
 
04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
go back you pay a bigger fee and and
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
this is one of the really I think genius
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
parts of
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
s137 it's not just about the barrels
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
it's not just about growth it's about
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
what you can offer your consumers right
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
so the consumers don't care and I know
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
you some of you have heard this from
 
04:10:04.990 --> 04:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
Brewers before and you'll probably hear
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
it today they don't care if you're a
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
Craft brewery a nano brewery a brew pub
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
they don't even know these categories
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
all they know is my neighborhood bar my
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
small town you know Craft brewery I want
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
to go and get a good beer and and some
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
food they have to tell their customers
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
all the time sorry we can't sell you
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
wine sorry we can't sell you a beer from
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
another Brewery sorry we only have these
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
limited options and the customers don't
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand because they're not locked
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
into that rigid categorization in other
 
04:10:37.349 --> 04:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
states as well as much as we are here in
 
04:10:39.389 --> 04:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what this bill does it
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
allows you to pay different fees for
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
different te and offer a much different
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
variety so it's just it's so much more
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
flexible for the entrepreneur and the
 
04:10:52.510 --> 04:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
business when we look at this from the B
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
center point of view just from a
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory standpoint it just makes much
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
more sense it's more intuitive for the
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
business owner it's more intuitive for
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
the customer it creates a lot more
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the market changes the
 
04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
Craft Beer Market like everything else
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
changes rapidly so it gives those
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
business owners the opportunity to say
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
you know what maybe we want to add some
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
Selter maybe we want to add some
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
different options we can do that we to
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
the state we apply we pay a fee we can
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
do that quickly it's just much more
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
flexible so our overall take on this is
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a big Boon for Economic
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
Opportunity and Entrepreneurship in New
 
04:11:26.429 --> 04:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also for economic growth
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
once you see once you get this change in
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
place I think you're going to see a lot
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
more people try and experiment and do
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
startups um and if we get a a more
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
robust industry here that's more
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
flexible and more customer friendly it's
 
04:11:43.070 --> 04:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
a small effect but it will you know help
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
and I know you guys have heard this
 
04:11:46.269 --> 04:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
before when it comes to recruiting young
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
people recruiting Talent um people from
 
04:11:51.630 --> 04:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
out of state they want a vibrant night
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
life they want a vibrant restaurant
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
industry they want variety and this will
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
I think do a little bit to help keep
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
people here so I think it's a good bill
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
of great thank you very much for your
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you I I have a question
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh we do have a question representative
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
Herbert sorry slow with the trigger um
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure you know the answer but
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh do we get Mike it's a little far from
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
does the state get a percent of
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
sales that I think I'll leave to a more
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
of an expert on the actual they do I so
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
we were getting revenue from this so
 
04:12:26.950 --> 04:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way this the way I look at
 
04:12:29.229 --> 04:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
the licensing here
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.550 --> 04:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
is revenue shouldn't be your primary
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
concern about this right you want to
 
04:12:39.429 --> 04:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
grow the economy but when you're
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
creating more flexibility and ease of
 
04:12:43.590 --> 04:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
growth for businesses I think you're
 
04:12:44.750 --> 04:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to end up getting a lot more
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue in the long term over this even
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
if some businesses uh change their
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
classification cuz under this some uh
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
brew pubs for example might want to go
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
to a small tier tier one or tier 2 uh
 
04:12:57.389 --> 04:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturing license but because you're
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
creating that flexibility you're easing
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
entry into the market I think you're
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot more businesses come
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
into the market it's going to create
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
more competition it's going to create
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
more economic activity so I think in the
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
long run the revenues are going to go up
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
not just from the fees but from the
 
04:13:13.469 --> 04:13:13.479 align:start position:0%
taxes from the sales from the r meals
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
tax I think this is an economic winner
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
not just for the economy as a whole but
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
for state
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
revenue thank you yeah for the record um
 
04:13:23.870 --> 04:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
a licensing fee should only it should
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
never be perceived as a revenue
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
generator it should only be the cost for
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
the Department to enforce the statute
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
however in the state of New Hampshire we
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
do have a rooms and meals tax and that
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
was a original issue with the Nanos
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
because some of them thought they might
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
be exempt from the rooms and meals and
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
we had to clarify that uh yes they
 
04:13:48.269 --> 04:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely pay the rooms and meals tax
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
when they sell their beer list they give
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
it away for free which technically
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
do and uh and then of course they make
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and bet tax and all
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
those good things that help the state
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
revenue thank you very
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
much okay uh next up is uh we'll have
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.000 --> 04:14:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon Hi how are you uh my name is
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
Kiren nevs I'm a co-founder and owner of
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
Tuckerman Brewing Company and also
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Brewers
 
04:14:48.750 --> 04:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
Association and referring back to your
 
04:14:51.389 --> 04:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
question about taxes yes we do pay rooms
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
and meals tax uh we also pay an excise
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
tax to the state and we pay a federal
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
excise tax as
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
well uh but yes but so sorry so I am
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
here uh testifying in support of s SP
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
137 uh this legislation will simplify
 
04:15:09.389 --> 04:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
Brewery licensing New Hampshire and it
 
04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
will put all Brewers on an even playing
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
field this will eliminate confusion for
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
Brewers and their customers when
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
different Brewery license types have
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
different uh rules of operation right
 
04:15:22.990 --> 04:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
now um we're a beverage manufacturer we
 
04:15:24.870 --> 04:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
started in 98 so we've been a beverage
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the state for 26 years
 
04:15:28.750 --> 04:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
but this the industry has changed
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
dramatically in that time uh but since
 
04:15:34.349 --> 04:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
then the Nano B was added uh The Brew
 
04:15:36.189 --> 04:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
Pub has been around for a long time but
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
we all have different abilities as to
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
what we can do in terms of selling uh
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
beer and uh whether we have food
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
requirements required so it gets very
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
confusing as to who can do what SP 137
 
04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
would put us all as beverage
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
manufactures and then it would be sort
 
04:15:54.990 --> 04:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
of all a cart like if we wanted to start
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
a restaurant attached to the brewery and
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
serve uh serve more beer then we would
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
add a restaurant license to that for
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
beer and wine or if we wanted to sell
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
cocktails we could add a liquor license
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
to that as well but it would be more of
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
an all a card system but it would add
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
put us all sort of on an even playing
 
04:16:12.600 --> 04:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
put us all sort of on an even playing
field

04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and we have find found over the years
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of confusion
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
when a customer can go a couple miles
 
04:16:21.750 --> 04:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
down the road to a nano brewery and
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're able to order food from a food
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
truck and also order many pint as many
 
04:16:28.269 --> 04:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
pints as they want but if they come to
 
04:16:30.109 --> 04:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
our place before we added our restaurant
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
license we were restricted to order uh
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
selling one or two pints at a time and
 
04:16:36.750 --> 04:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
it just gets confusing for customers and
 
04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
I think it puts New Hampshire breweries
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage because when they come
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
from NE neighboring states and they have
 
04:16:45.229 --> 04:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
a much uh easier time visiting local
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
breweries and their experience there it
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
sort of puts us at a disadvantage when
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
they can't do that in New
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but yeah uh and I'm happy
 
04:16:56.429 --> 04:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions repres burough hi this is a
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe I live in your area
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
you know I'm in the Mount Washington
 
04:17:04.510 --> 04:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
Valley Valley I just want to say what an
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
amazing addition Tuckerman has been to
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
the valley it's a place where young
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
people go I guess I don't qualify in
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
that that description anymore but um you
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
know a great place where people come for
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
events and you have great food and I was
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
very disappointed how tough trivia night
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
was last
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
week that can't be tough but no thank
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
you very
 
04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you very much all right
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you guys uh Damon Lewis from
 
04:17:31.040 --> 04:17:40.590 align:start position:0%
thank you guys uh Damon Lewis from
vulgar

04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
Brewing yeah so I'm sorry I'm a little
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
nervous first time doing this sort of
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
thing but uh I'm Damon Lewis from vulger
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
buring I appreciate everybody's time and
 
04:17:51.149 --> 04:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
Chairman's time um it's funny because
 
04:17:53.070 --> 04:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
literally what is described as my exact
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
situation we have opened in 2019 in
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
Franklin New Hampshire we were licensed
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
as a nano brewery uh as of tomorrow we
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
will be licensed as a beverage
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh and the only reason for
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
that change for us is we wanted to carry
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
cider uh we don't want to up production
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to do any of those
 
04:18:11.710 --> 04:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
things but under our Nano license we
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
cannot bring in any product that we
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
don't make and we are not allowed to
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
make cider U because we want to provide
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
more options for the people that come
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
into our place and some are gluten-free
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
obviously a brewery is is not a good
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
place for that so we want to provide
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
those options um so for us it's it's
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
kind of does bring everybody on the same
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
playing field we now be buying cider
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
from a distributor so they actually have
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
a revenue stream they didn't have before
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
because we were not even able to do it
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to um so I really just
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
testifying support um for that reason I
 
04:18:41.550 --> 04:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
mean it affects us drastically and of
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
course the licensing fee until this
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
would goes into effect hopefully uh we
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
had to pay an extra $1,200 just to to
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
have that right um with no plan changes
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
to really use any of the other benefits
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
that currently the beverage manufacturer
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
tier provides um so being able to scale
 
04:18:58.830 --> 04:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
up and add that would be a huge deal for
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
us and we're a small Brewer compared to
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of places so uh $1,200 does matter
 
04:19:04.750 --> 04:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
to us you know I mean it matters to
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
everybody but that's somebody's paycheck
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
you know one week when we're slow in the
 
04:19:10.349 --> 04:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
winter those sort of things so um just
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
want to raise my support and if anybody
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
has any questions about that process
 
04:19:15.550 --> 04:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
because it did take about four months to
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
change that as well um I'm happy to
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
answer them you know at any time
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
so guess we're all set thank you thank
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
you uh chair will call in Erica
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:38.109 --> 04:19:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
petar hit the hit the button there you
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
go there we go thank you chairman hun
 
04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee for hearing
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
this um most of my points have been
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
touched on so I Will Not Waste too much
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
of your time um but this is a bill that
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
we've been working on for a few years as
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
most of you know um we think it's
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly significant for the Brewing
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
industry not just to simplify the
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
licensing process and help with that uh
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
streamlining communication with the
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission um reduce costs offer
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
more growth opportunities in an easier
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
way um but we genuinely believe that it
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
will help all aspects
 
04:20:15.870 --> 04:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
all stakeholders in this industry um you
 
04:20:18.750 --> 04:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
know from the breweries with the ability
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
to do something with an alart license
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
for a retail outlet for example a lot of
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
us really like finding those open spots
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
in possibly rundown Main Street
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
communities where we can't produce beer
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
there it's not big enough but we could
 
04:20:35.830 --> 04:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
bring some Vitality back to some small
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
towns um if we can just set up our
 
04:20:40.510 --> 04:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
retail space there currently not an
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
option for Nano breweries but it is for
 
04:20:44.830 --> 04:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
for beverage manufacturers um I think
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
we'd see a lot of benefit in some of
 
04:20:49.149 --> 04:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
these smaller towns um I'm in Peterboro
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
we are now just a local hub for
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
Neighbors to meet sit around have a beer
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
like Damon I would love to have a cider
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
for many of the people that come and
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
just drink non-alcoholic seltzers to
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
hang out um so it benefits all of the
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
breweries I think it could really
 
04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
benefit some of our smaller Main Street
 
04:21:11.429 --> 04:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
communities um it also will increase our
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
relationship with distributor
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um on day one as soon as I can I'll sign
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
on with somebody to get cers in my top
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
room um and we do think it'll encourage
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
more people to add that restaurant
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
license or Food Service license to their
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer now that it'll be
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
an easier process so I think everything
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
else I plan on saying has already been
 
04:21:32.189 --> 04:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
said U but if you have any questions I'm
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
answer have a question representa Ammon
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sher thank you for your
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
testimony you did a great job um this
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
question may be for you or maybe the
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so if you don't know
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
the answer um this act takes effect July
 
04:21:46.720 --> 04:21:47.670 align:start position:0%
the answer um this act takes effect July
1st

04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
2024 uh how does the transition how how
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
do you imagine the transition would work
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
from the old licensing scheme to the new
 
04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
licensing scheme does everybody have to
 
04:21:58.269 --> 04:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
apply July 1st I think that how I
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
imagine it it's probably not how the
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission will answer that so uh
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's definitely a better question for
 
04:22:04.239 --> 04:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
that's definitely a better question for
them

04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the bill will go to a
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll be revie the
 
04:22:11.560 --> 04:22:13.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll be revie the
process

04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%

04:22:21.680 --> 04:22:25.189 align:start position:0%
it seeing none they will close the
public

04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%

Bill 433 on behalf of Senator Lang

Senator Lang originally brought this
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill forward due to concerns regarding
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
perceived unequal enforcement of the
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax as well as how it is
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%

however as amended by the Senate the
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%

cigarette you can add what is called a
 
04:24:38.349 --> 04:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
vape liquid that contains it's a liquid
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
form of uh nicotine that is combusted
 
04:24:43.469 --> 04:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
within the uh uh device in order to
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
smoke it that's how I understand it do
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
not drink it can you put it drink what
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%

I represent the New Hampshire Vapor
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of this
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh Brett who owns 11 vape stores in
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can explain a little more
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
in detail why but in general since the
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
tax which is relatively new I believe
 
04:25:39.070 --> 04:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
just three years went into place there's
 
04:25:40.990 --> 04:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
been some discussion as to whether all
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
the taxes are actually being collect
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
collected how they're being collected
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
and is there potentially a better way to
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
do so to make sure that they are our
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's probably
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
literally several million dollars worth
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
of taxes that are not being collected
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
out there and representing the vapor
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
Association we want it to be done
 
04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
properly um it undercuts obviously if
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
people aren't paying their taxes it
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
undercuts those that are doing it
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
properly um and I think Brett can speak
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
to a little more
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
detail awesome uh thank you all for your
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
time my name is Brett scottt and uh
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
again kind of building off from that so
 
04:26:16.269 --> 04:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
specifically here in New Hampshire I own
 
04:26:18.910 --> 04:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
11 stores and I pulled some information
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue to better
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
understand what percentage of the Vape
 
04:26:26.109 --> 04:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
tax we're paying and we are paying at
 
04:26:29.229 --> 04:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
that time when I did that we were paying
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
26% of The Vape taxes being collected by
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that's out of
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
11 stores and uh though I would love to
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
tell myself that we're 26% of the market
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
share I know that's not reality
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
um these products are sold in
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
Convenience Stores um I mean if you
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
drive Salem alone there's a lot of
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
stores um you know and there's a lot of
 
04:26:52.990 --> 04:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
these stores throughout the state so
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's a major problem with this when
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
you look at the uh cigarette Market
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
There's an actual tax stamp on those
 
04:27:01.710 --> 04:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
products um that market it's a Level
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
Playing Field because there's an
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
identifier the tax has been paid um it's
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
very closely tracked uh so there's good
 
04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
control of that market this Vape Market
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
there is not tracking any identifier on
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
here that's been paid and the auditing
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's currently done is very generic uh
 
04:27:20.830 --> 04:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore it makes it very easy for
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
people to evade paying the taxes on
 
04:27:24.990 --> 04:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
these products and it's a major problem
 
04:27:27.389 --> 04:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
and I truly believe that the amount that
 
04:27:30.550 --> 04:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
is not being collected is substantial
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
and would absolutely be worth the time
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
to revisit to to take a look at this and
 
04:27:37.469 --> 04:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
see if there's a better way to make sure
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
that the tax is being paid and uh that's
 
04:27:42.750 --> 04:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately what I'm here for is uh
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
seeking a Level Playing Field and I
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
discussions repres M uh thank you and
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%

26% what is that in dollars how much is
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
that mean amount in dollars we're paying
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
over $200,000 a month in
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
tax that's just out of the 11 I mean I
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
own stores in other states but that's
 
04:28:10.990 --> 04:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire just out of
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%

Amendment

04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%

04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
interested in a amendment to deal with
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
this 433 issue but uh fundamentally is
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
that uh we're we're dealing with a fly
 
04:28:47.189 --> 04:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
by night kind of uh in in in business
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's not big tobacco and we're which big
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
tobacco is is highly regulated and we I
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't think they put stamps on it
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
anymore per se right they on cigarettes
 
04:29:00.510 --> 04:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
they do they still have still have that
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
stamp on absolutely some reason I
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%

04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
rid of oh okay we got rid of the the
 
04:29:09.870 --> 04:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
real stamp there used to be a a stamp

stamp that used to be you know the tag
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
stamp familiar that we that I was around
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%

04:29:30.269 --> 04:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
none we will close Senate Bill 43 it's
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.760 --> 04:29:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
business

04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:29:35.600 --> 04:29:38.030 align:start position:0%
business
okay

04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:41.070 --> 04:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
soes now we're behind ahead of schedule
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman quick question about
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow yes the are we changing the
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
schedule at all tomorrow or deleting one
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
or changing sub what happened was Senate
 
04:29:53.229 --> 04:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 354 which we're hearing
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
today because um senator in was not
 
04:30:00.030 --> 04:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
going to be able uh to make it
 
04:30:03.550 --> 04:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh and so I moved it today so
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
evidently if you have a calendar that
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
still has 354 tomorrow uh you can ignore
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
it um otherwise uh tomorrow I believe
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
we'll have then after the the morning
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have then heard all our Senate
 
04:30:23.109 --> 04:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
bills and and um so the tomorrow
 
04:30:26.349 --> 04:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon is free and then starting the
 
04:30:29.109 --> 04:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
following week we have two weeks in
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
which we have to do subcommittees get
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
through all the bills and execute we
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
have to have everything out by the
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
15th of May so we're GNA do two days
 
04:30:42.269 --> 04:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
next week we'll do two days next week
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll try to divide it up by the
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um and we'll try to just
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know Trot through those um it used
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be we'd always say well it's almost
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
easier when you have Senate bills
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
because they've already been through the
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
grinder on the Senate side but uh this
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
year it feels a little different about
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
the vigilance the senate had on their
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislation yes representative
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
spear since we we have a few minutes
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
before the next start could you explain
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
about the study committees because we
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
have two bills now oh okay chapter study
 
04:31:20.189 --> 04:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
committees yeah so chapter study
 
04:31:22.750 --> 04:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
committees is after uh the bill has been
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor um then it goes
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
to and you can see what terms of whether
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
their appointments House and Senate um
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
and traditionally it's always been
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
Senators never show up on the second
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
year so that's why there's only one
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
Senator on these study committees and
 
04:31:43.469 --> 04:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
then and chalk full of three or four
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
house members because evidently house
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
members are more than willing to show up
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
for a study committee I generally myself
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
personally the study committee should be
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
really well focused on getting something
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
accomplished or what they're doing when
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
you have a study committee that's going
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be a little general and just overall
 
04:32:05.469 --> 04:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's it's going to feel
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
like if you get appointed it's going to
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
time so um otherwise the they are
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker so if there's a
 
04:32:17.790 --> 04:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
study committee you see that you really
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
want to get on I do urge you to uh let
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
speaker let the speaker you want to do
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
the one that's not kind crazy the
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is it does it they can
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
they can wave the rule about how we
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't meet in July and
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
August so that if the if the chairman of
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
the committee and
 
04:32:46.269 --> 04:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
um is interested in actually you know
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
spending more time and delving into it
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
they could actually meet in the
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
summer and I would have to say that's
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
number one reason why I avoid being
 
04:32:58.990 --> 04:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
appointed to a study committee because I
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to drive up from Rhode
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
Island June 15th I got on June 15th you
 
04:33:08.109 --> 04:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
have to volunteer for this I mean it's
 
04:33:11.070 --> 04:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
not like you can no you'll be you they
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
um I would say say that often the
 
04:33:16.510 --> 04:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
speaker will call me up and ask me who I
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
think should be
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
appointed and since you
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
asked so yeah no it should be you you
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
really want to interested in in doing it
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a committee and a
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
commission so okay so yeah committee
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
difference between a committee and a
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
commission a committee is only going to
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
have house members appointed to it a
 
04:33:41.199 --> 04:33:42.429 align:start position:0%
have house members appointed to it a
commission

04:33:42.429 --> 04:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
is uh it's a free-for-all so uh for
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
instance the marijuana bill was a
 
04:33:50.590 --> 04:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
commission so that had all kinds of
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
interested parties who had some skin in
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the game would then get appointed to the
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
commission um and then you have limited
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
amount of legislators per se we're on a
 
04:34:01.520 --> 04:34:04.670 align:start position:0%
amount of legislators per se we're on a
commission

04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
so any else you want to think I should
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
add on that well the the the interesting
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
thing is uh who calls the first meeting
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
usually says uh it's based on the bill
 
04:34:16.429 --> 04:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
yeah who with the bill number was a
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
Senate bill so these say the first named
 
04:34:21.390 --> 04:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
Senate member will call the first
 
04:34:23.949 --> 04:34:23.959 align:start position:0%
meeting sometimes the Senate never calls
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
the first meeting and so the thing just
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
happen probably we should not have
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
passed it in the first
 
04:34:35.359 --> 04:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
passed it in the first
place

04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
I was going to come over and get your
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
problem I got my
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh the nuclear Mission had a report that
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.639 --> 04:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
got

04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%

04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
354 and this is an interesting Bill and
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there'll be a lot of discussion
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
in testimony that follows me and uh many
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the folks behind me will be able to
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
answer some of the technical questions
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
that I might not be quite so precise in
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
answering but I can uh generally present
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here and why we're
 
04:44:47.150 --> 04:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
doing it so imagine you went out to
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
dinner and you've got a gift
 
04:44:53.070 --> 04:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
certificate and you've enjoyed your meal
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
waiter comes over leaves the check you
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
put down your gift certificate and a
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
credit card when the server returns with
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
your payment you notice you've been
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
charged the full amount despite of
 
04:45:06.750 --> 04:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
having gift certificate which doesn't
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
much make
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
sense and it doesn't seem right to you
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
well that's essentially what we're
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
dealing with in this particular bill is
 
04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
a situation where you have assistance in
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
paying for a medication and the
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company says that's great and
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're not applying that to your
 
04:45:28.150 --> 04:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
deductible so if you put yourself in a
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
medical position instead of
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
dinner my sister-in-law for example has
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
just wrapped up chemotherapy $10,000 a
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
month insurance pays about 8,000 of that
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
80% the other
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
2,000 comes from the pharmaceutical
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
company and in this situation like many
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
others the insurance company says thank
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
you very much but we're not applying
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
that to your deductible so you as a
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
patient still have to cover that
 
04:46:00.190 --> 04:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
deductible to get to the place where you
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it anymore so
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
effectively the companies are double
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
dipping at the expense of the patients
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
and in my view and the view of many
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
others it shouldn't really matter to the
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company who's paying for
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
the medication if the insurance company
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
isn't paying for it
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
themselves so it's a fairly logical uh
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill I think that we're bringing forward
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
here and I'll read to you an excerpt
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
from an article that appeared regarding
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
the a similar bill in the state of Rhode
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
Island so we had a patient who was being
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
treated um very expensive treatment and
 
04:46:43.470 --> 04:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
this patient had gone through two
 
04:46:46.030 --> 04:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
treatments um and was ready for the
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
third and when they placed the order the
 
04:46:50.548 --> 04:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
representative on the phone said that he
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
would owe
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
$2,400 in payment he said that can't be
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
right because I should have met my
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
deductible already so he contacted the
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
insurance company and after many hours
 
04:47:01.390 --> 04:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
on the phone was told that because the
 
04:47:03.788 --> 04:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
plan included a copay accumulator
 
04:47:05.788 --> 04:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
adjustment program which is what this
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
bill tried to eliminate any support for
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
his prescriptions that didn't come out
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
of pocket
 
04:47:12.788 --> 04:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
would not be counted against the
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
deductible so again why should it matter
 
04:47:17.910 --> 04:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company who's paying
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
for the medication just so it's being
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
paid and shouldn't that apply to the
 
04:47:22.280 --> 04:47:23.430 align:start position:0%
paid and shouldn't that apply to the
patients

04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
deductible there are an awful lot of
 
04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
organizations that support this those
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that work with patients
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
with hemophilia who take medication all
 
04:47:34.590 --> 04:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
the time the American Cancer Society is
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
supportive among
 
04:47:39.390 --> 04:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
others some people say well if this goes
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
through we're going to see a big
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
increase in health insurance costs
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
that's simply not true in the 19 states
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
where similar legislation has been
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
passed the global health healthy living
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
Foundation has found no significant
 
04:47:55.230 --> 04:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
change to health insurance premiums in
 
04:47:57.750 --> 04:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
those 19 States and I think that speaks
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
for itself so let's make sure that
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
co-pays count regardless of their Source
 
04:48:05.470 --> 04:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's big Pharma someone helping
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
a patient out through a GoFundMe or some
 
04:48:10.270 --> 04:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
other source or the patient themselves
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
let's just it all apply to the
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
deductible as it should and I'm happy to
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay let me start
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
first because I like stories and you
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
told us a story yes I did okay so when I
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
have a gift card
 
04:48:31.390 --> 04:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
MH somebody paid for that gift card
 
04:48:34.350 --> 04:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
correct there was cash paid somewhere
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
along the line so when I'm applying it
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm taking advantage of the fact that it
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
was that piece was
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
paid yes so in your
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
example who
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
paid for that coupon I see where you're
 
04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
going with this and it's essentially a
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
credit from the pharmaceutical company
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
so the pharmaceutical
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
company is when when you turn in that
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
card that that discount card yes to the
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy yes the pharmacy is expected to
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
turn it in just like a coup like he gets
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
gift gift C C or no corre uh coupons yes
 
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
and it's going to turn it in and fer or
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
and fiser will pay
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
it they will pay it that's the
 
04:49:23.310 --> 04:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that I have that they
 
04:49:26.190 --> 04:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
really would pay it well the pharmacy
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
the far the pharmacy where you're
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the prescription is getting
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
paid right why say I care it's at the
 
04:49:40.030 --> 04:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
end of the day the the um the issue is
 
04:49:44.430 --> 04:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
that is a this coupon is is going to get
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
paid the pharmacy is going to get its
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
paay correct and therefore the pharmacy
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
would then notify the insurance company
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:49:57.150 --> 04:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
that the sum of actually they wouldn't
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
notify as far as the're concern they're
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
saying is they're going to be paid and
 
04:50:03.868 --> 04:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's really now a cash flow
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
problem for the pharmacy okay because
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy is going to want is going
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
to take that coupon corre they're going
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
to tell the insurance company that they
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
paid it that's right that it got paid
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes and it's up to them the pharmacy to
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
go get the money from the pharmaceutical
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
company correct and it that's a
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
different story isn't it now I don't
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
know if it is or not okay well that was
 
04:50:30.270 --> 04:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
a different story than I was told I
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
would encourage you Mr chair ask that
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
question some of the folks behind make
 
04:50:36.990 --> 04:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure that's exactly the way the bill is
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be handled I knew I could
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
count on you
 
04:50:42.990 --> 04:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay now we have questions
 
04:50:43.000 --> 04:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
okay now we have questions
representative

04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.750 --> 04:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
spear insurance companies have set up
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
formulary formularies with the pbms
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes when a coupon is made available it's
 
04:51:01.868 --> 04:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
usually made available for a spe
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
specific branded drug that's correct
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
that bypasses the formulary it bypasses
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
all of the insurance companies
 
04:51:11.548 --> 04:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
accounting for how they're going to
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
build on their uh premiums okay and now
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
essentially kind of guided towards a
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
drug rather than being able to have an
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
analysis that says this a perfectly good
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
other drug that costs half the price but
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get it because
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
you've gone onto this coupon thing and
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want it and you don't want to
 
04:51:39.390 --> 04:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
change so in the instead of the
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
formulary being used as a guidance to
 
04:51:44.590 --> 04:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
find all the drugs that are available at
 
04:51:48.030 --> 04:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
a specific tier now we're having drug
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
companies Market directly to the
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
insurance uh Market directly to the
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
patients bypassing all the efforts that
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
are made and I saw that that I saw that
 
04:51:59.830 --> 04:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare considers this a kickback
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
scheme and that they won't even allow it
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
so my question to you
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
is how is this going to
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
solve or or maintain price
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
maintain uh premium prices and the cost
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
of premiums when we can't even control
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
what drugs are being sold to the uh cons
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
to the patients when there are perfectly
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
good drugs
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
available I'm not sure I understand the
 
04:52:27.718 --> 04:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
available I'm not sure I understand the
question

04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
um let's say let's say we amend this
 
04:52:35.708 --> 04:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
bill to say it can only be for generic
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
drugs only for generic correct well
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
it shall not apply in the case of
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drug for which there's a
 
04:52:46.510 --> 04:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
generic alternative so we're kind of mov
 
04:52:48.030 --> 04:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
I'm doing the opposite I see that you
 
04:52:50.350 --> 04:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
are yeah I mean words the assumption is
 
04:52:52.830 --> 04:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want someone to buy a to get a
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
drug because because they have that
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
coupon right that they're going to take
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the one that is more expensive than the
 
04:53:03.470 --> 04:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
generic one and therefore that's where
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the increase in
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
premiums because now like a heroin
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
dealer you've given them that cheap
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
price because you gave them a couple of
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
coupons and got them hooked and now
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to want that name brand
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
product and when those coupons run out
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
you're but Mr chair respectfully I think
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
you're treating this as if it's a coupon
 
04:53:26.548 --> 04:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
for something in the grocery store where
 
04:53:28.350 --> 04:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
the consumer makes a full choice of what
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to be taking in this case
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
you have a doctor offering a
 
04:53:35.070 --> 04:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
prescription and a specific medication
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
for a particular patient with a specific
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
problem that to me is a different
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
scenario if there is a generic
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
alternative that's effective then I
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that should be the
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
first choice of care assuming it works
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't and there are cases where
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
it may not biosimilars and whatnot um
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
then I think this situation still
 
04:53:58.510 --> 04:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
applies I understand your argument but
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a really a free Choice market
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
for most patients with cancer there are
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
specific drugs treat specific cancers in
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
specific ways and that's what the
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
doctors describe this bill it says it
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
cannot have
 
04:54:14.510 --> 04:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
a generic or any other more affordable
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
drug well as it's written now it says
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
the requirement shall not apply in the
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
case of a prescription drug for which
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
there's a generic alternative so
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
effectively we're saying start with the
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
generic right okay but with the key
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
element my remember was my my uh
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law that the doctor wanted to
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
put her on
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
eloquest and El this is years ago yeah
 
04:54:40.548 --> 04:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
El just came out and it was like know
 
04:54:42.310 --> 04:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
the hugely expensive but she was
 
04:54:44.548 --> 04:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
Medicare anyways yeah so I don't even
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
know whether Medicare how how Medicare
 
04:54:49.150 --> 04:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
treats it back then but the issue was
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
that that yeah he gave her a coupon but
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
the coupon it was only limited there was
 
04:54:57.868 --> 04:54:57.878 align:start position:0%
only that first visit yeah and then
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
after that now she's on the more
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
expensive the eloquest and never was
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
really offered the opportunity to get on
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
something that might have been less
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
expensive in going forward yeah I think
 
04:55:12.990 --> 04:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know the desire all the time is to
 
04:55:14.910 --> 04:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
try to keep cost down and get patients
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
the treatment they deserve and if a
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
generic does that then fully supportive
 
04:55:22.548 --> 04:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
of that um if not and there is an exp
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
more expensive alternative that works
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
better your side effects more effective
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
and this comes into play then we'd like
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
to see that count toward to the
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
deductible but I appreciate your point
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
so so basically the the end of the day
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that because that patient got what
 
04:55:39.948 --> 04:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
that doctor referred because they were
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
taking the coupon the fact that there is
 
04:55:45.910 --> 04:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
a consequence for everyone else who
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that opportunity that the
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
overall pharmaceutical costs are going
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
up because the more expensive drug was
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
was the one that got the name you know
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
the name brand not that to you it's that
 
04:56:01.350 --> 04:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
fairness of that we're all we're all
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
paying we should all be happy that that
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
patient was able to get that name brand
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
drug wow that that's what we really
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
should be happy about I think one of the
 
04:56:13.548 --> 04:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
concerns I hear as an undercurrent in
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
your comments is that insurance rates
 
04:56:17.310 --> 04:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
will go up because if those drug costs
 
04:56:19.390 --> 04:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
are going up well the drug I'm assuming
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
the drug is more expensive in fact
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
insurance cost should go up too but
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
analysis of the 19 states that have
 
04:56:26.910 --> 04:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation hasn't proven
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
that to be the case and only thing I
 
04:56:32.430 --> 04:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
educate and make sure everybody knows is
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
about the mlr the minimum loss ratio
 
04:56:37.350 --> 04:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and that minimum loss ratio takes a
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
while for you to to see it because it's
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
on a rolling threeyear average
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
understood so you really don't know how
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
much impact those coupons had until you
 
04:56:49.390 --> 04:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
know you're out three years out three
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
years out
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
understood okay representing M thank you
 
04:56:56.670 --> 04:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I also like a good story and
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
I even further like a good analogy if I
 
04:57:00.910 --> 04:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
can combine the
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
two so what I like to ask you about is
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
are these coupons at all like restaurant
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
gift certificates if you
 
04:57:12.910 --> 04:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
probably not but it is a good analogy
 
04:57:14.350 --> 04:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
that helps people to understand the
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
concept well if if you if you had just
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
so you know there are two kinds of GI to
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
it there's one that you actually paid
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
for I'm talk about then there's another
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
one that is they they do a sale they're
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing a discount trying to entice you in
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
now the reason I say this is because I
 
04:57:35.230 --> 04:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
wrote the law and that is if someone
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
underlying pays for that coup that gift
 
04:57:40.868 --> 04:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
certificate it cannot EXP expire in New
 
04:57:43.548 --> 04:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in many states they were
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
expiring them in two years but if it's a
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
gift certificate that had no underlying
 
04:57:52.030 --> 04:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
dollar value then yes they can expire
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
chairman when we discussed that many
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
years ago on behalf of the restaurant
 
04:58:04.510 --> 04:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
and Laing Association
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
and and and and I loost so the qu the
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
question is is this at all like having
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
that do the pharmas carry this uh credit
 
04:58:18.190 --> 04:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
as a liability on the books and and it
 
04:58:21.390 --> 04:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
then should the consumer you know expect
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
to get value for that coupon and and
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
they have it as a liability much like
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the restaurants would have or do
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
and that's why they wanted to expire
 
04:58:32.070 --> 04:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
them and we had that we had that
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
discussion many many years ago having
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
been in the hotel business
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
representative I know exactly what
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and selling the
 
04:58:42.030 --> 04:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
place you've got that liability that
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
you've got to credit the buyer with
 
04:58:45.628 --> 04:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
right I can't answer for the
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies on how they
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
handle the accounting on this perhaps
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
someone who's yet to testify can address
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
that for you thank you for the
 
04:58:57.150 --> 04:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
question no I was thinking the banking
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
credit debit and you know erases the
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
transaction out that's all I wanted to
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
know when you said credit yeah I said oh
 
04:59:11.708 --> 04:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
okay well the pharmacy's got toes
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
here yeah that's what I'm
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
that's the house oversight committee did
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
a study over five years on Medicare they
 
04:59:21.840 --> 04:59:23.270 align:start position:0%
a study over five years on Medicare they
found

04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
found
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
that once a coupon
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
expired a person was now in favor of
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
that drug that they've gotten used to
 
04:59:36.430 --> 04:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
the drug price went up an average of 12
 
04:59:41.510 --> 04:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
to 12 to 133% okay
 
04:59:44.110 --> 04:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
versus the situation where they don't
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
allow coupons which they don't allow
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
anymore they did not see that increase
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay so when you say that it will not
 
04:59:53.548 --> 04:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
cause an increase in drug prices that's
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
not what Medicare found I understand and
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
other states have found the same thing
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
California did an incredibly extensive
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
study on this and it showed a very
 
05:00:05.470 --> 05:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
similar kind of an increase that once a
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
person got moved into that drug
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know that is it's marketed directly
 
05:00:14.910 --> 05:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
from the drug company to the patient
 
05:00:17.548 --> 05:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
going beyond the even in some cases the
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
doctor going usually beyond the doctor
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
and Beyond the uh the uh insurance
 
05:00:24.080 --> 05:00:25.990 align:start position:0%
and Beyond the uh the uh insurance
company's

05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
company's
 
05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh they're now got
 
05:00:31.948 --> 05:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
somebody locked in and prices are going
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
up so when where are you getting I mean
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on why you
 
05:00:39.470 --> 05:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
say this this goes against everything
 
05:00:42.750 --> 05:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
that the formulary does which is to to
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
en encourage uh competition if you will
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
and this takes takes that away right
 
05:00:51.750 --> 05:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
because we're marketing directly from an
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
insurance comp uh from a uh drug company
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
to a patient even the doctor doesn't get
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
involved in some of those cases so I'm
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
not clear on why represent are you
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
saying that Medicare does no longer
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
allow this no they do not they consider
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
it Medicare considers coupons
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
I want to use the right words an illegal
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
Kickback that's what they write it's an
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
illegal Kickback if we were to write
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
this bill to say that the coupon can
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
never expire once a consumer has been
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
given a coupon that that coupon will
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
have to last as long as that patient
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
needs that drug Representatives I think
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
you're trying to bring this down to a
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
consumer level a coupon for poptarts
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
right versus toaster strudel as a
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
medical consumer I don't get those
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
choices I work with the doctor the
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
coupon is for a specific purpose for a
 
05:01:48.910 --> 05:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
specific drug drug at a specific time
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
it's not for a hotel room three years
 
05:01:53.548 --> 05:01:53.558 align:start position:0%
from now or for a discount on Pop-Tarts
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
next week which I think would be a great
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
thing I love Pop darts um you seen the
 
05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
movie but I I understand the reasoning
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
and the logic I don't disagree with that
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
logic I'm just not sure it neatly fits
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
this situation we are the Commerce
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
Committee you know that yes I understand
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
consumer I'm a bit of a Commerce
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
Professor myself representative Amon has
 
05:02:17.120 --> 05:02:18.310 align:start position:0%
Professor myself representative Amon has
a

05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
for giving your testimony um curious
 
05:02:26.670 --> 05:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
about precedent in other states uh has
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
this been done elsewhere and how
 
05:02:30.548 --> 05:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
recently and to what effect it's been
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
done in 19 States and it's been
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
successful in all of those to the best
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%

really appreciate the thought you put
 
05:02:49.470 --> 05:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
into it I do hope we can get to a place
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
where we can do something with this and
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for your time I do

three section three
 
05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
yes this is a program of maximizers and
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
efforts by the insurance companies to
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
help patients with uh very expensive uh
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs correct and this bill
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
specifically wants to take that away if
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
on one hand we're talking about wanting
 
05:03:25.920 --> 05:03:26.910 align:start position:0%
on one hand we're talking about wanting
to

05:03:26.910 --> 05:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:30.270 --> 05:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
support drug access to
 
05:03:32.350 --> 05:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
individuals why do we have this in here
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
to try to take it away how is it taking
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
it away I'm not sure I
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
follow oh I have a paper on it okay I

05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%

department and I'm Michelle Heaton I'm
 
05:04:18.310 --> 05:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
the director of life and
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
health yeah I thank you for your time so
 
05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has some real
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
concerns for Senate Bill 354 as this
 
05:04:29.230 --> 05:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
passage will contribute to increased
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
premiums however this is a policy
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
decision that is the board faces Ure a
 
05:04:37.470 --> 05:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
plan design accounts for payment of
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
covered benefits and patient cost
 
05:04:42.750 --> 05:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
sharing to pay claims if an outside
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
stream of payment such as a
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's coupon is used to offset
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
total cost sharing responsibility then
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
reactively insurers will have no other
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
choice but to increase premiums in
 
05:04:54.840 --> 05:04:57.670 align:start position:0%
choice but to increase premiums in
subsequent

05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.270 --> 05:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
years this passage of the bill will
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
inhibit generic efficiency which refers
 
05:05:05.310 --> 05:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
to the Market's rate of uptake of newer
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
lower cost drugs this also applies to
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
biosimilar which are sometimes refers to
 
05:05:10.760 --> 05:05:11.470 align:start position:0%
biosimilar which are sometimes refers to
as

05:05:11.470 --> 05:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
generics I would suggest the language
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
change on section two of the bill to
 
05:05:18.350 --> 05:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
also include biosimilars in addition to
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
the word generics there because most of
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
the drugs effect fet rebates are
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually not classified as generics
 
05:05:24.480 --> 05:05:30.628 align:start position:0%
actually not classified as generics
rather

05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
biosimilars okay where is
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
it we've all learned about biosimilars
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
in previously
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
so that's all we have and we'll happy to
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have okay
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have questions
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan has a
 
05:05:49.390 --> 05:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
question can you explain I mean I I
 
05:05:53.070 --> 05:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
think the previous speaker was going and
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
closer to the
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
mic when the uh previous the sponsor was
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
speaking I was going to ask the
 
05:06:00.548 --> 05:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
questions that both the chairman and
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative spear were asking with
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
regards to the with with regards to the
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
idea that we're sort of subsidizing or
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
the or the pharmaceutical company
 
05:06:11.310 --> 05:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
subsidizing ing a
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
premium name brand drug which is going
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
to be more expensive right but it seems
 
05:06:17.788 --> 05:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
the language in here sort of addresses
 
05:06:19.230 --> 05:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the generics and maybe
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
we make a change about biosimilar so
 
05:06:23.470 --> 05:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
what is your
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinking that this is going to drive the
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
cost now to the extent that there's
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who is getting a name brand
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
drug and that's the only choice there is
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
um is it because somebody who needs it
 
05:06:37.390 --> 05:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
simply won't buy it because they can't
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
afford it without this like what's
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
what's the thinking that that you want
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
us to think about because you said it's
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to drive up premiums well I I
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
heard the sponsor talk about rational
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
Choice that's an economic theory that
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
consumers in perfect markets perfect
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
competition have choices poptarts he
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned I love poptarts but but
 
05:06:59.470 --> 05:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
delivery of Medical Services might be a
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
little bit different with prescription
 
05:07:04.110 --> 05:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
drugs the market could benefit by
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
competition and so we've seen that
 
05:07:09.548 --> 05:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
clearly in the small molecule drugs to
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
generics generics can be as much as 85%
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
cheaper compared to the Branded small
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
molecule drugs however in the biologics
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
market we don't see any type of cost
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
savings like that one of the main
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
reasons is because there's not a lot of
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
competition so any any kind of policy
 
05:07:30.510 --> 05:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that inhibits the uptake of new lower
 
05:07:33.788 --> 05:07:33.798 align:start position:0%
cost biosimilars or generics will by
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
Nature be a cost driving policy so any
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
way that you could introduce competition
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
to that market would be by by the same
 
05:07:46.350 --> 05:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
definition and by the same token um you
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
know exert downward pressure on prices
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
for these expensive question F question
 
05:07:54.190 --> 05:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
but it's different yeah okay um all
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
right so I get what you're saying and I
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
agree with you completely um what what
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with is if there's a
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
generic available and I know we want to
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
add language in about bio
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
similars then is that a moot point or or
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
or explain to me rather how the the name
 
05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
brand drug if that's the only thing
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
there and it's being subsidized how
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's the channel through which
 
05:08:20.190 --> 05:08:20.200 align:start position:0%
it's costing I agree we shouldn't be
 
05:08:21.548 --> 05:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
subsidizing name brand if there's a
 
05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
cheaper generic out there and it sounds
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
like the language in here doesn't allow
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
for that so I'm still not following you
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
just cited bio similar which we need to
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
add in and generics as something that we
 
05:08:33.310 --> 05:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
want people to use if it's available but
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
if it's not available what are we
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and that's it seems like
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is only addressing when it's not
 
05:08:38.600 --> 05:08:40.030 align:start position:0%
this is only addressing when it's not
available

05:08:40.030 --> 05:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I think with regards to that part
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
of it um section one it it shows that
 
05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
this has to do with whether or not the
 
05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
value of the C coupon can apply to the
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
cost sharing responsibility of the
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
patient and so what that does is it
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
shifts you know plan designed for
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
insurers depends upon a combination of
 
05:09:02.910 --> 05:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
covered benefits and patient cost
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
sharing responsibilities which varies
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
widely across the health insurance plans
 
05:09:10.270 --> 05:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
that we regulate
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
by now allowing an extraneous Force to
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
apply for cost sharing that the insurer
 
05:09:19.230 --> 05:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't include in their
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
subsidies for payment for covered
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
benefits the the next year that will
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
almost Force the insurers to increase
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
premiums because now there's some
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
other some other outlet for that the
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
value of those coupons leaving the cost
 
05:09:37.788 --> 05:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
sharing pool so another question further
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
question me inquire I understand what
 
05:09:40.200 --> 05:09:40.948 align:start position:0%
question me inquire I understand what
you're

05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:09:44.910 --> 05:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
saying what I'm trying to get at is What
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
alternative does that person have if
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's only the name brand drug and if
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's only the name brand drug and
 
05:09:52.990 --> 05:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
some and that name brand producer gives
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
them a subsidy to buy it and that's the
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
only option there's no biosimilar
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:09:58.480 --> 05:10:00.070 align:start position:0%
there's no
generic

05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
generic
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
then what is the CH so are we saying we
 
05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
just don't want those people to take
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
those drugs I mean that like I'm not
 
05:10:08.548 --> 05:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
following the logic how this drives
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
price I get the whole Market idea like I
 
05:10:12.750 --> 05:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
trust me I'm on board with that I
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be even having this discussion
 
05:10:17.470 --> 05:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
or debating this if it were not didn't
 
05:10:19.190 --> 05:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
have this language already in here about
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
the generics and and the need as you
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
said to add in BIO similars but it
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like this is only
 
05:10:27.070 --> 05:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
addressing when this only applies when
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
there is no generic and there is no
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
biosimilar once we change the language
 
05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
so how does that drive cost short of
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
keeping somebody from getting the drug
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
that they need that the money that would
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
have been paid to the cost sharing now
 
05:10:41.070 --> 05:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to the patient
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
deductible I think I understand that but
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
if if he's saying is is If there really
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
is no other choice if there is no other
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
choice there really is no other choice
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that this is the right drug and so
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
there is no really cost shifting going
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
on it's just more expensive because it
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
is the only choice I think the concern
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
is that if there's only one available
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
the drug manufacturer can
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
and this is concerned I'm not saying
 
05:11:12.830 --> 05:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
this is necessarily done they can be
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
increasing the price that the carrier is
 
05:11:17.310 --> 05:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
going to pay but then they're going to
 
05:11:20.310 --> 05:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
fun all savings directly to the patient
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the overall C cost of prescription
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
drugs may go up but the consumer isn't
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily seeing that because they're
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
getting the advantage of the coupon so I
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
think there is a potential that there
 
05:11:35.070 --> 05:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
could be some manipulation with the
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
prices there and that's what could lead
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
to overall drug spend going up cuz
 
05:11:40.750 --> 05:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
they're not the one internalizing the
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
cost so I I get that but so the
 
05:11:45.230 --> 05:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
alternative might be then then that
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
person just doesn't get the drug like if
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
they truly can't afford that deductible
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
that seems like that might I mean if
 
05:11:53.070 --> 05:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's a $2,000 I don't know what the
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
deduc I think because I mean I've is the
 
05:11:58.190 --> 05:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
most extreme case there if you're
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
talking about commercial health
 
05:12:01.510 --> 05:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
insurance plans there are a variety of
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
options available some of them with very
 
05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
low cost sharing very low deductible but
 
05:12:08.310 --> 05:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
you end up paying more in premium if
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
someone were to be on this high cost
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
drug one of those other plans may be a
 
05:12:14.670 --> 05:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
better fit for them because overall
 
05:12:16.190 --> 05:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
their out- of pocket costs are going to
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
be minimal so they do have access to
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
these drugs I think there's a
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
combination of a lot of factors there
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
but the drug is going to be available to
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
them if it's the only drug available and
 
05:12:30.030 --> 05:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay whatever that
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
plan design dictates they would have to
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there's a coupon
 
05:12:36.270 --> 05:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
or not and that's kind of what they have
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to when they've purchased the
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
plan so if they have you know High a lot
 
05:12:43.708 --> 05:12:43.718 align:start position:0%
of uh medical costs and a lot of
 
05:12:46.030 --> 05:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs they may want to
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
get a plan that has you know those lower
 
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
cost sharing amounts final question or F
 
05:12:52.548 --> 05:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
further question so this is probably
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
more of a would you believe would you
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
believe I I do actually agree with what
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
you said about the bio simar we should
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
add in there and I do agree that we
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
should not be in any way subsidizing
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
people to use name brand drugs when
 
05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's something similar generic
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
biosimilar whatever that all makes sense
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
to me um and to the extent that there
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
are different insurance plans that that
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
might be great when it comes to renewing
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
time or whatever but um I think at some
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
level we want to make sure that people
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
aren't somehow priced out and if the
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
only way they can get access to one of
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
these name brand drugs when that's there
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
are no Alternatives is and the only way
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
they can afford their portion of it is
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
by getting some sort of coupon for lack
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
of a better word then um I think we we
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to like discount that or try
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
to disuade that practice and it seems
 
05:13:38.670 --> 05:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
like a potential unintended consequence
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
drug companies sto doing it because they
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
don't count anymore and now people maybe
 
05:13:46.030 --> 05:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't lose access to drugs and that's
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
just a concern I don't know if it's a
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
Val concern but it's the one that pops
 
05:13:50.230 --> 05:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
in my head real quick when I'm thinking
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
about this for after this discussion
 
05:13:54.910 --> 05:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in and sharing okay
 
05:13:54.920 --> 05:13:57.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in and sharing okay
represent

05:13:57.230 --> 05:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
Pier outside of the deductible slash U
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
coupon Market or maybe taking advantage
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
of the coupon Market insurance companies
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
do offer plans called maximizer plans
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
and what these plans will do they will
 
05:14:13.990 --> 05:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
pay the whole price of the drug if a
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
person needs it but it's outside of the
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
deductible like any other drug that they
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
may have to take they may have to pay a
 
05:14:23.788 --> 05:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
deductible for that drug but if they're
 
05:14:26.430 --> 05:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
taking a drug of which there is no uh
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
competition it's a it's a very expensive
 
05:14:31.548 --> 05:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
drug you know Cancer drugs hemophiliac
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
drugs those kind of things there are
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
maximizer plans and I know that uh uh
 
05:14:39.150 --> 05:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
what is it Anthem has a very big one
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
that's very popular that patients like
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
and then I pay anything out of pocket
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
for that for some of those drugs once
 
05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
they get into those plans and those
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
plans don't cost any hardly anything so
 
05:14:50.670 --> 05:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
there are other a avenues for these
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of things on top of that the drug
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
companies uh a
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
question what was it what's your
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
question no I'm answering him I all
 
05:15:03.548 --> 05:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
right and would you
 
05:15:05.670 --> 05:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
believe and would you believe they're
 
05:15:08.830 --> 05:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
not going to go without the drug okay so
 
05:15:08.840 --> 05:15:10.030 align:start position:0%
not going to go without the drug okay so
uh

05:15:10.030 --> 05:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the interesting point here we heard in
 
05:15:15.548 --> 05:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that generally they
 
05:15:18.670 --> 05:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
don't give coupon rebate these things
 
05:15:20.590 --> 05:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
for drugs that have no
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
competition because there is no
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
choice the patient's going to have the
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
doctor is going to give him that
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
eloquest because the eloquest was the
 
05:15:31.150 --> 05:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
only one on the market at that time and
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's the right you know that's what
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to do so the only adverse
 
05:15:37.470 --> 05:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
selection that's occurring here with
 
05:15:39.868 --> 05:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically um that person um really
 
05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
if they weren't for that
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
coupon and it's a very expensive
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
medication then really what that person
 
05:15:54.750 --> 05:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
would have done if the market was the
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
perfect Market would not would be not to
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
choose a high deductible
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
plan because if they had you know if
 
05:16:06.270 --> 05:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
they had a very low deductible then it
 
05:16:09.070 --> 05:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't seem so bad the the expens
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be there but that's adverse
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
selection because they were Ted away
 
05:16:16.708 --> 05:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
from that to say you know that that you
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
know that oh don't worry we're going to
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
give you a subsidy for that deductible
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
and that's where we it's impossible to
 
05:16:27.310 --> 05:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
really calculate what exactly is
 
05:16:30.190 --> 05:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
occurring when you choose that drug that
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
had that coupon or your doctor
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
prescribed it and said this is the only
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay representating M thank you Mr
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
question do you think that these third
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
Cy thirdparty co-payment programs help
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
people who otherwise wouldn't have
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
access get access to these most critical
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
drugs life life-saving drugs where
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
them it's important I think for everyone
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
to know that everybody's exposed to high
 
05:17:09.628 --> 05:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
cost drug
 
05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
we all 93% of our state is insured so we
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
all by sharing the same risk pool we all
 
05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
pay the cost of prescription drugs it's
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
tempting and easy to look at anecdotal
 
05:17:23.878 --> 05:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
tempting and easy to look at anecdotal
situations

05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
situations
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
one person's I live the I live the life
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
that you talk about but we don't have
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
the luxury in our roles of having a
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
myopic view of individual situations
 
05:17:38.910 --> 05:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
rather we try to look at the entire
 
05:17:41.070 --> 05:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
insured population and we try to make
 
05:17:41.080 --> 05:17:41.948 align:start position:0%
insured population and we try to make
difficult

05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
decisions that help better most people's
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
situation and so I just want the the
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee to remember that that that's
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
an important um priority that we always
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to balance in our roles and so I
 
05:17:58.270 --> 05:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
think by and large our society does a
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
really good job ensuring access to these
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
expensive drugs um for life-saving
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
therapies for people and when we see
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
situations like this we try to evaluate
 
05:18:12.510 --> 05:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the betterment of one individual
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
situation compared to the betterment of
 
05:18:18.110 --> 05:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
society and we see every year in our
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
annual hearing report that gets much
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
maligned but we hold much Credence in it
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
we see that prescription drug
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures are the primary drivers of
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
health care costs which right now and in
 
05:18:32.548 --> 05:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
the past five years we've seen this
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
increase at an untenable trajectory so
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
we' be remiss to not talk about that and
 
05:18:40.548 --> 05:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
it's pretty ubiquitous across the
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
insured population that high cost
 
05:18:45.070 --> 05:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are driving that so
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's generally an important underlying
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
theme that I want all the members of the
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
committee to be aware about so is that
 
05:18:56.590 --> 05:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
is that a yes or a no that's a difficult
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
question to answer it is I agree and
 
05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great political answer you gave
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
but I
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
just he's nonpolitical no I know but
 
05:19:07.750 --> 05:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you should be I mean I just asked
 
05:19:10.548 --> 05:19:10.558 align:start position:0%
do you think these these programs
 
05:19:10.558 --> 05:19:12.868 align:start position:0%
do you think these these programs
provide

05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:19:15.070 --> 05:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
access to these drugs for people who
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise get them just like a
 
05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
crowdfunding or a church fundraiser
 
05:19:22.150 --> 05:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
provides access to them I do not I think
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the intermediate and then the long
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
run they actually inhibit more access to
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
better life-saving innovations that lie
 
05:19:31.948 --> 05:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
in the in the near Frontier for people
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
so by that logage by that logic if we
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
got rid of them and banned these
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
programs then more people would actually
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
get access right so the converse is true
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
in your in your thought so if you don't
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
think they provide a more access if we
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
got rid of them then more people would
 
05:19:47.470 --> 05:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
get access it's one way or the other I
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
didn't summarize it that way but I I
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
think that these types of mechanisms are
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
are cost drivers for prescription drugs
 
05:19:58.750 --> 05:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
and they impede this concept of generic
 
05:20:00.990 --> 05:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency that is important Market
 
05:20:04.030 --> 05:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism to ensure this the control and
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
the stabilization of high cost
 
05:20:08.190 --> 05:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs which empirically our
 
05:20:10.548 --> 05:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
annual report has clearly shown is the
 
05:20:12.990 --> 05:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
number one cost driver and we have to
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
constantly evaluate that so I appreciate
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
you summarizing it that way I'm just not
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
in accord with the way that you did that
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.590 --> 05:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony take no
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and good
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon uh my name is
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
Donald Cree I live at 292 Pleasant
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
Street here in conquer I am a state
 
05:20:51.310 --> 05:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
official who fights on behalf of
 
05:20:53.948 --> 05:20:53.958 align:start position:0%
consumers for a living but today I'm
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
here in my personal capacity or more
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
particularly I'm here as the dad of a
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
young woman who is about to graduate
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
from college despite having been born 22
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
years ago with cystic fibrosis and
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm here in that capacity I'm
 
05:21:10.990 --> 05:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
not here with analogies or with anything
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
like that I'm here with stories from The
 
05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
Real World of life with expensive
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs like uh all of the
 
05:21:20.910 --> 05:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
other patient and family advocates that
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're likely to hear from today I urge
 
05:21:25.788 --> 05:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
you to pass what Senator Apprentice has
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
called the all co-pays count act but my
 
05:21:30.750 --> 05:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
family's perspective might be somewhat
 
05:21:33.628 --> 05:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
different than those of others like most
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
CF patients my daughter takes a drug
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
called Tria triaa it's a miracle drug
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that costs in excess of
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year when I heard about
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
$10,000 a month cancer treatments and
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
maybe a $2,000 a month co-pay I thought
 
05:21:54.868 --> 05:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
oh how quaint fortunately Rose is on the
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state employees health
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
plan triaa costs her next to nothing but
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
in four short years she will be on her
 
05:22:06.270 --> 05:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
own health coverage wise and if she ends
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
up with a high deductible Health Plan
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
she will need to beg tra's manufacturer
 
05:22:15.390 --> 05:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
vertex Pharmaceuticals for co-pay
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
assistance no way would my daughter be
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
able to afford
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
$60,000 a year out of pocket for one
 
05:22:25.990 --> 05:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
drug it is worth remembering and I think
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
you all know this already from what
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
you've already been saying why insurance
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
companies impose co-payment requirements
 
05:22:34.670 --> 05:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
the idea is to turn patients into Savvy
 
05:22:37.708 --> 05:22:37.718 align:start position:0%
non-wasteful consumers and to be honest
 
05:22:39.788 --> 05:22:39.798 align:start position:0%
Rose could respond to that kind of
 
05:22:42.868 --> 05:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
incentive by going off triaa her death
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
would not be imminent but no other drug
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
does what triaa does and some patients
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
are far more dependent on triaa than my
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
daughter is and it is in my opinion
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
outrageous and unfair to expect any CF
 
05:23:00.910 --> 05:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
patient to make a choice like that
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies should not be
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to force such choices on
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
patients via copay accum ulator programs
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
but neither should patients like rose
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to depend on the kindness of
 
05:23:16.030 --> 05:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
strangers by which I mean co-pay
 
05:23:18.070 --> 05:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
assistance programs offered by
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies like vertex the
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
highly respected Institute for clinical
 
05:23:25.708 --> 05:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
and Economic Review in Boston has
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
investigated the incremental benefits of
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
triaa and has determined that the drug
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
is overpriced by roughly a factor of
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
three so not what that means it's a
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year drug that should cost
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
one $100,000 a year so there's $200,000
 
05:23:44.910 --> 05:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
of free money lining the pockets of
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
vertex Pharmaceuticals at $100,000 a
 
05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
year it would still be a very expensive
 
05:23:52.990 --> 05:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
drug to compensate that company's
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
shareholders for the cost of having
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
developed it so in other words insurers
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
like Anthem have a point here copay
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
assistance programs exist because drugs
 
05:24:06.190 --> 05:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
are overpriced and the whole situation
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
puts patients in the middle in a manner
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely unconscionable so yes
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
please report Senate Bill 354 to the
 
05:24:17.350 --> 05:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
floor with an a to pass recommendation
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
but do not let big Pharma off the hook
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
this state has a prescription drug
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
affordability board which is just
 
05:24:25.948 --> 05:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
getting off the ground and which the
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry is constantly
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
trying to thwart or abolish altogether I
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
urge you to strengthen the pdb by giving
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
it authority to set Upper price limits
 
05:24:39.390 --> 05:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
so co-pay assistance programs become
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary every single year my
 
05:24:44.548 --> 05:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
daughter's pharmaceutical bill is a
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
multiple of my annual salary as a state
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
employee that is unsustainable certainly
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the context of state employment my
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
daughter is about to graduate from
 
05:24:56.350 --> 05:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
Bowden College over in Maine with an
 
05:24:58.470 --> 05:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
honors degree in government she hopes to
 
05:25:00.670 --> 05:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
pursue a public policy career and I
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
would like her to do that right here in
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
conquered but she can't do that if she
 
05:25:07.948 --> 05:25:07.958 align:start position:0%
can't afford to live here as a cystic
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
fibrosis patient so yes yes to Senate
 
05:25:13.708 --> 05:25:13.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 354 but please don't stop there
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for listening I'd be delighted to
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the chair
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
might be willing to allow anybody to
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
ask any questions from the member so
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're the consumer protection for the
 
05:25:27.788 --> 05:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
Pu yes that's right I'm the consumer
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
knew you look familiar yes I do uh
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
utility rates for a living that is how I
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
know when prices are ridiculously now we
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert has a
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
question all these companies research
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
and otherwise uh are
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
certified by the federal government they
 
05:25:56.190 --> 05:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
have they have the the rights to do what
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing correct yes okay now the
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
federal government also is the one that
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
issues or agrees to issue
 
05:26:09.390 --> 05:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
patents yes I correct so from my
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
perspective wouldn't it be uh an
 
05:26:15.868 --> 05:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
interesting experiment if the federal
 
05:26:18.590 --> 05:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
government said to this
 
05:26:21.070 --> 05:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
company we're going to take your patent
 
05:26:23.948 --> 05:26:23.958 align:start position:0%
away and if you don't like that we're
 
05:26:25.548 --> 05:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
going to take your certification away
 
05:26:28.230 --> 05:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
too and you can go work in
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
France but but I I mean I I I don't see
 
05:26:36.110 --> 05:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
the I don't see where the government is
 
05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
actually making an a difference here
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
where I can I can see where it obviously
 
05:26:44.430 --> 05:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
can well I would say that the ability to
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
protect one's intellectual property
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
including Innovative medicines are what
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
give shareholders the incentive that
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
they need to make the Investments that
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
they need to make in order to make drugs
 
05:26:59.590 --> 05:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
like triaa possible to begin with so I
 
05:27:01.470 --> 05:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
think as a matter of I guess American
 
05:27:04.270 --> 05:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
history patents have had an enormously
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
positive effect on Innovation and
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
therefore our wealth As Americans so I
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
would personally be very careful about
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
reigning in the US patent and trademark
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
office's ability to Grant patents to
 
05:27:18.670 --> 05:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers like vertex but more to
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
your point what happens with a drug like
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh triaa is in addition to the patent
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
they acquire an exclusivity period from
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
the Food and Drug Administration when
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
the FDA approves and reviews their drug
 
05:27:32.350 --> 05:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
and there are legitimate questions about
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
whether those exclusivity periods are
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
too long and there are issues about
 
05:27:38.430 --> 05:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
patent thickets and other tricks the
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
drug manufacturers play in an effort to
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
take what I consider to be undo
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
advantage of the protections that they
 
05:27:47.590 --> 05:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
enjoy under the uh uh patent under the
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
patent statute so so I I guess my answer
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
to you representative Herbert is that
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated and difficult
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
area uh you know patents and Drug
 
05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
exclusivity are matters of federal law
 
05:28:03.150 --> 05:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of stuck with what
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
Congress has given all of us by way of
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
encouraging and promoting drug
 
05:28:10.230 --> 05:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
Innovation we lead the world I'm very
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that triaa is an
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
American invention that drug was largely
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
paid for by the nickel and dime
 
05:28:19.628 --> 05:28:19.638 align:start position:0%
donations that people like me have been
 
05:28:21.310 --> 05:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
raising from our friends and neighbors
 
05:28:23.708 --> 05:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
for decades via the Cystic Fibrosis
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation I don't I don't want to get
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
into I I don't want to interfere in that
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
I just want a drug that is vital to the
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
survival of CF patients and it really is
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
a breakthrough and a miracle to be
 
05:28:39.150 --> 05:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
available to everybody who needs it at a
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
price that they can
 
05:28:45.310 --> 05:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
afford thank you very much thank you uh
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.200 --> 05:29:02.270 align:start position:0%

05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.230 --> 05:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon chairman hunt and
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
Susanna Von in I'm a resident of Warner
 
05:29:13.470 --> 05:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the state lead for the New England
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
bleeding disorders advocacy Coalition a
 
05:29:19.708 --> 05:29:19.718 align:start position:0%
member of the New England hemophilia
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
association but most importantly I'm the
 
05:29:25.470 --> 05:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
mother of a 26-year-old son with severe
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
hemophilia a a rare genetic bleeding
 
05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
disorder that impairs the ability of the
 
05:29:33.868 --> 05:29:33.878 align:start position:0%
blood to clot
 
05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
properly I'm testifying in support
 
05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
of SB 354 to ban the practice of co-pay
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
assistance or a co-pay accumulator
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
adjustment programs implemented by the
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies fairly
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
recently I may say since about
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
2016 prior to that uh there was not
 
05:30:00.990 --> 05:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
these programs were not in
 
05:30:03.548 --> 05:30:03.558 align:start position:0%
existence first let me State um I was
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
listening to the previous conversation
 
05:30:06.990 --> 05:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
that nowhere in this bill do I see the
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
word coupon it is co-pay
 
05:30:13.788 --> 05:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
assistance we do not receive coupons in
 
05:30:16.350 --> 05:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
fact right now we are not taking Cay
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
assistance from a
 
05:30:21.230 --> 05:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or a third party be that a
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
grandparent a charitable
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
organization uh primarily because my son
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
is now on his own insurance policy prior
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
to that he was on mine our co-pays were
 
05:30:34.350 --> 05:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
very low I worked for the federal
 
05:30:36.150 --> 05:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
government that's a big Insurance Pool
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
so my insurance policy was is really
 
05:30:42.510 --> 05:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
good but my son with his bleeding
 
05:30:45.948 --> 05:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
disorder needs which is by the way
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
genetic lifelong extremely complex
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
because of his severity of the uh uh
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
hemophilia he is requir he
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
needs expensive
 
05:31:06.030 --> 05:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
medication in order to have a normal
 
05:31:09.510 --> 05:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
life and a career pay taxes have a
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
family and work he's a Timber framer
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
he's um his own company of one so he had
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
to go on the marketplace when he opted
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
out of my aged out I should say of my
 
05:31:23.120 --> 05:31:25.470 align:start position:0%
out of my aged out I should say of my
insurance

05:31:25.470 --> 05:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
policy it took us a few months to find
 
05:31:31.868 --> 05:31:31.878 align:start position:0%
one that would meet his medical
 
05:31:35.310 --> 05:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
needs did you know that 2third of New
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire open market policy
 
05:31:41.590 --> 05:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
have accumulator adjustment programs I
 
05:31:43.590 --> 05:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
didn't that's from the AIDS
 
05:31:46.070 --> 05:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
International report from
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
2023 not only that but when we talk to
 
05:31:49.440 --> 05:31:50.510 align:start position:0%
2023 not only that but when we talk to
uh

05:31:50.510 --> 05:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:52.670 --> 05:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov with an experienced
 
05:31:55.110 --> 05:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
broker and we asked them which policies
 
05:31:56.670 --> 05:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have accumulator
 
05:31:58.990 --> 05:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment programs that person had
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
never heard of them yet two-thirds have
 
05:32:01.440 --> 05:32:02.230 align:start position:0%
never heard of them yet two-thirds have
these

05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
programs so then my husband narrowed it
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
down to two policies that would address
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
most of my son's medical needs not just
 
05:32:11.948 --> 05:32:11.958 align:start position:0%
prescriptions but periodic doctor's
 
05:32:13.868 --> 05:32:13.878 align:start position:0%
visits he goes to the Dartmouth
 
05:32:15.990 --> 05:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
hemophilia treatment center and uh
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
Handover New
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he contacted the two agents
 
05:32:22.350 --> 05:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
and asked if they had accumulator
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment programs One agent never
 
05:32:29.788 --> 05:32:29.798 align:start position:0%
responded the other one emailed us did
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
not say yes but this is and I'm quoting
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
I need to read this as you can tell I'm
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
very passionate about this subject
 
05:32:40.750 --> 05:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
only amounts that the member is paying
 
05:32:40.760 --> 05:32:43.070 align:start position:0%
only amounts that the member is paying
would

05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.670 --> 05:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
contribute no discounts or co-payments
 
05:32:49.070 --> 05:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
from the drug company will apply towards
 
05:32:49.080 --> 05:32:50.470 align:start position:0%
from the drug company will apply towards
the

05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
deductible it's only the out-of-pocket
 
05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
expenses from the member so if I give my
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
son the money then he can pay his his
 
05:33:06.350 --> 05:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
deductible if I pay the deductible
 
05:33:09.030 --> 05:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
directly it it's the co-pay I mean it
 
05:33:11.788 --> 05:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
will not count to the maximum out of
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
pocket or the deductible if I pay it
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is what an accumulator adjustment
 
05:33:17.280 --> 05:33:18.628 align:start position:0%
that is what an accumulator adjustment
program

05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:33:22.270 --> 05:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
is 19 states have prohibited this
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
because it's really double dipping it's
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
not a coupon my son by the way cannot
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
switch medications they're all expensive
 
05:33:33.070 --> 05:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
every single one for hemophilia there is
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
no generic alternative and there are few
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and if he does he may get
 
05:33:41.040 --> 05:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and if he does he may get
an

05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
inhibitor which now means he needs even
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
more of the factor to stop those
 
05:33:50.830 --> 05:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
bleeding incidents those clots so we're
 
05:33:53.470 --> 05:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
in this situation where
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
we could use co-pay assistance but it's
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
useless because it will not contribute
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
to his out-of- pocket maximum or is
 
05:34:05.190 --> 05:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
deductible and it's not a coupon the
 
05:34:05.200 --> 05:34:06.310 align:start position:0%
deductible and it's not a coupon the
drug

05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
drug
 
05:34:09.150 --> 05:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer would pay pay for co-pay up
 
05:34:11.868 --> 05:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
to a point and oh by the way there is a
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
financial limit for co-pay assistance
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
for these drugs at least for hemophilia
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
400% above the poverty
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
level if you add up the maximum amount
 
05:34:24.510 --> 05:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
of pocket
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
deductible if you add up the co-pays and
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
his premiums it's about $10,000 a year
 
05:34:35.230 --> 05:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
that's a quarter of what he
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
earns I don't know who can survive on
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
that so my son who's
 
05:34:44.670 --> 05:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
26 might choose I can't he has to take
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
this medication regularly in order to
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
keep those factors normal so that you
 
05:34:51.868 --> 05:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
know if he has an incident he bruises
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
like us as opposed to having an internal
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
bleed and going to the ER but he might
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
say I got to pay rent I have to pay
 
05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and copay assistance isn't
 
05:35:06.430 --> 05:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to help me because it doesn't
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
count towards my
 
05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
maximum out of pocket or my deductible
 
05:35:11.948 --> 05:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
so I think I'll just skip taking my
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
good yeah I guess I've covered a lot of
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:30.430 --> 05:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:35:30.440 --> 05:35:32.030 align:start position:0%
um I
was

05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:35:34.510 --> 05:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
lobbying not lobbying but I was talking
 
05:35:37.230 --> 05:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
to our federal Representatives a number
 
05:35:43.548 --> 05:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
of years ago about hemophilia and
 
05:35:45.310 --> 05:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
CDC and bills such as the co-pay
 
05:35:52.190 --> 05:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
assistance the all co-pays count
 
05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill and the representative we talked to
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
asked the young woman who was with
 
05:36:02.110 --> 05:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
me why why should we pay for these
 
05:36:04.830 --> 05:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
really expensive bills you know it's I'm
 
05:36:06.990 --> 05:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a taxpayer I'm an insurance payer my
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums or covering your cost
 
05:36:11.310 --> 05:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
and the young woman looked at him and
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
she said I want to go to
 
05:36:16.030 --> 05:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
college I want to be a productive member
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
of society I want to pay my
 
05:36:22.750 --> 05:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
taxes I want to
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
live but I want to be productive and so
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
does my son and he can be with his
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
medication but he needs help until he
 
05:36:37.230 --> 05:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
makes enough money to cover it so my
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
understanding from this bill I have some
 
05:36:39.680 --> 05:36:41.670 align:start position:0%
understanding from this bill I have some
notes

05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
notes
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
Here co-pay assistance is limit at least
 
05:36:47.670 --> 05:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
for the products that we use through the
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer it's limited by the
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
household income when it was on my
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
policy we didn't need it he now needs it
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
because he's a low to moderate income
 
05:36:59.120 --> 05:36:59.868 align:start position:0%
because he's a low to moderate income
right

05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
now there are no coupons no words in the
 
05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill about coupons it's co-pay
 
05:37:08.830 --> 05:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
assistance so if somebody gets it the
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company gets paid
 
05:37:14.510 --> 05:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
twice yes because it doesn't count to
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
the maximum out deductible so whatever
 
05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
other medical bills pharmacies the the
 
05:37:23.590 --> 05:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
patient still has to pay that until
 
05:37:25.948 --> 05:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
they've reached their maximum they would
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
reach their maximum quicker if they had
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
co-pay assistance if I pay my son's
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
co-pays and give him the money he'll
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
reach it faster I
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
won't but there's no word of coupons
 
05:37:40.708 --> 05:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's just co-pay assistance and by the
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
way at least from my understanding and
 
05:37:45.708 --> 05:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
the words from the insurance company it
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
could be a third party it doesn't have
 
05:37:49.390 --> 05:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be a manufacturer as long as they pay
 
05:37:49.400 --> 05:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
to be a manufacturer as long as they pay
it

05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
directly so this bill I am so in
 
05:37:58.350 --> 05:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
supportive because it will help low to
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
moderate New Hampshire residents with
 
05:38:01.200 --> 05:38:02.750 align:start position:0%
moderate New Hampshire residents with
chronic

05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
illnesses non-generic drugs there are no
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
options they're going to be expensive no
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
matter which brand they
 
05:38:12.910 --> 05:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
pick it will help them get their
 
05:38:17.948 --> 05:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
medication and live healthy productive
 
05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
lives without it I don't know what would
 
05:38:22.750 --> 05:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
happen to many of these patients
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
including my son if they have to make
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
tough decisions financial decisions so I
 
05:38:31.708 --> 05:38:31.718 align:start position:0%
ask you to support the Bill thank you
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony I'll be happy
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
questions okay I I guess I was one how
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
how is the insurance company paid twice
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is paid twice
 
05:38:45.868 --> 05:38:45.878 align:start position:0%
because the co-pay which would go
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
directly to the insurance company
 
05:38:50.830 --> 05:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
correct no the coopay the pharmacy
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy but it doesn't count to the
 
05:38:55.390 --> 05:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
maximum out- of pocket deductible if I
 
05:38:57.868 --> 05:38:57.878 align:start position:0%
pay it if if my son pays it to the
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy it goes towards as deductible
 
05:39:03.868 --> 05:39:03.878 align:start position:0%
right okay but if a manufacturer pays it
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
to the pharmacy it does not go to the
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
deductible so he still has and I think
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
it's thousands of dollars
 
05:39:15.070 --> 05:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
deductible he still has to meet that
 
05:39:17.070 --> 05:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
deductable before the insurance company
 
05:39:22.030 --> 05:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
will pay 100% for his medication so you
 
05:39:24.430 --> 05:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
see well I don't see the double pay no I
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
still don't understand how are they
 
05:39:28.110 --> 05:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
getting paid twice they they're looking
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
for the co-pay and they get something
 
05:39:33.990 --> 05:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
from and the the insurer is
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
is let's put it in dollars and cents
 
05:39:36.798 --> 05:39:37.830 align:start position:0%
is let's put it in dollars and cents
okay

05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be low because my math
 
05:39:39.400 --> 05:39:40.548 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be low because my math
isn't

05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
great if he has a co-pay he has a
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
deductible of
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
$500 right out of pocket maximum
 
05:39:55.230 --> 05:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
deductible and he pays the
 
05:39:55.240 --> 05:39:56.788 align:start position:0%
deductible and he pays the
co-pay

05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
co-pay
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
$100 goes towards the maximum out of
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
pocket right now he only has $400 he has
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
to pay right okay if he pays the next
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
medic ation round $100 now it's $200 or
 
05:40:14.670 --> 05:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
$300 and so forth however if a third
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
party be it a manufacturer be it a
 
05:40:19.868 --> 05:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
grandparent be in a charitable
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
organization and they have helped people
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
before I know and certainly in the
 
05:40:25.830 --> 05:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
hemophilia Community they are if they
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
pay that
 
05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
co-pay his maximum out of pocket stays
 
05:40:29.920 --> 05:40:31.468 align:start position:0%
co-pay his maximum out of pocket stays
at

05:40:31.468 --> 05:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:40:31.478 --> 05:40:33.030 align:start position:0%
at
$500

05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
$500
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
but the company's been
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
paid oh you're saying there accepting
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the money but then they're saying but we
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
will not apply it and so what do they
 
05:40:44.350 --> 05:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
say they're doing with the
 
05:40:47.708 --> 05:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
money I don't know ask an insurance
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
me Senator Andis mentioned 19 states
 
05:40:58.350 --> 05:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
have passed this um we are working on a
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
federal bill as well with many other uh
 
05:41:05.230 --> 05:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
organizations I would
 
05:41:10.110 --> 05:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
ask because my math not a
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
statistician I saw that insurance
 
05:41:16.070 --> 05:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
premiums would rise if this bill
 
05:41:19.230 --> 05:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
passed the rate of increase over the
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
years for those 19 States has not
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
exceeded the
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
norm for those states that have banned
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
it so the rate of increase insurance
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
premiums are going to rise every year
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
the rate of increase did not change if
 
05:41:35.110 --> 05:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
the rate of increase changes I'd like to
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
know how the insurance company can can
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
only to this co-pay assistance Bill and
 
05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
at what
 
05:41:48.030 --> 05:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
percent there are not that how many
 
05:41:49.468 --> 05:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
patients in New
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not
 
05:41:54.430 --> 05:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
use do not have the option of generic
 
05:41:56.910 --> 05:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
drugs have expensive drugs and need
 
05:41:56.920 --> 05:42:00.070 align:start position:0%
drugs have expensive drugs and need
co-pay

05:42:00.070 --> 05:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.788 --> 05:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
assistance and if there are a lot then I
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
would think this is a significant
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
problem for the state if they're not not
 
05:42:10.910 --> 05:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot I have to question why premiums
 
05:42:10.920 --> 05:42:13.110 align:start position:0%
a lot I have to question why premiums
would

05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:42:16.190 --> 05:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
rise and and now I'm not speaking for my
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
notes because I heard the previous
 
05:42:21.270 --> 05:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
conversation so does that answer your
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
question I I I and then like you said I
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
got to find out from the insurance
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
company what they do with that money if
 
05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're not allowing you allocating it
 
05:42:33.150 --> 05:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
so what are that what what's happening
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
to that money yeah than you got to
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
follow the bouncing ball thanks
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much for
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
Guerrero uh hi representative hunt and
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
members of the commit my name is dunan
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
um I live in
 
05:43:12.868 --> 05:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
Hudson and uh I grew up there my whole
 
05:43:15.788 --> 05:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
life uh today I'm representing the New
 
05:43:18.390 --> 05:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
England hemophilia association and the
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
national bleed bleeding disorders um
 
05:43:24.270 --> 05:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
Foundation um me personally I have
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
severe hemophilia type a um I was
 
05:43:29.430 --> 05:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed at
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
Birth and um when I was two years old I
 
05:43:35.788 --> 05:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
developed something called an inhibitor
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and I know Susie mentioned this
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
before I came up here but what an
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
inhibitor is is an
 
05:43:46.620 --> 05:43:46.630 align:start position:0%
antibody that
 
05:43:46.630 --> 05:43:48.430 align:start position:0%
antibody that
[Music]

05:43:48.430 --> 05:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:43:50.190 --> 05:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
um pretty
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
much inhibits the body
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
to uh absorb the factor that many
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
hemophiliacs take so when I kind of like
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
relate it to people who don't know are
 
05:44:03.788 --> 05:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
not very involved in hemophilia and
 
05:44:05.190 --> 05:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't really have much knowledge about
 
05:44:07.948 --> 05:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
it is like a game of Pac-man
 
05:44:10.670 --> 05:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
so you have Pac-Man eating all these
 
05:44:12.110 --> 05:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
ghosts which are the
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
factor um so for me I take actually the
 
05:44:19.070 --> 05:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
same medication as Susie's son it's
 
05:44:21.628 --> 05:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
called hem Libra and I've been on that
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
for seven years now and um it's worked
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
well for me but you know I've had still
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
very severe bleeds to the point where
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
I've had to you know take leave of
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
absences from college uh um I've been
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
fired from uh a job in 2022 because of
 
05:44:47.070 --> 05:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
my bleeding disorder um so the drug has
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
worked well for me by and large but
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
still overall it's a tough diagnosis to
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to live with um especially when you
 
05:44:58.750 --> 05:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
consider my choices for treatment like I
 
05:45:01.468 --> 05:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
said I've been on this factor for seven
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
years and
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you
 
05:45:08.350 --> 05:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
know the PO pool of Factor products as
 
05:45:12.830 --> 05:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
small as it is um when we talk about you
 
05:45:15.390 --> 05:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
know generic drugs it's a very small
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
pool and then for me I have an inhibitor
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
like I said so the pool only goes down
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
smaller with my choice of um factors
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
that I can
 
05:45:25.558 --> 05:45:27.548 align:start position:0%
that I can
take

05:45:27.548 --> 05:45:27.558 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
um so this is you know a really hard
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
thing for me if my Factor isn't really
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
working or if I'm having insurance
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues like I was you know in 201 21
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
then I'm not really left with many
 
05:45:40.558 --> 05:45:43.230 align:start position:0%
then I'm not really left with many
options

05:45:43.230 --> 05:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
options
 
05:45:46.468 --> 05:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm here you know just again
 
05:45:49.868 --> 05:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
just to support um Bill SB
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
354 um you know I really believe that um
 
05:45:59.150 --> 05:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will help patients with uh
 
05:46:01.390 --> 05:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses not only hemophilia
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
alone but um with cystic fibrosis like
 
05:46:07.468 --> 05:46:07.478 align:start position:0%
um The Man Behind Me
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
was mentioning earlier with cancer
 
05:46:13.150 --> 05:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
patients with diabetics any patient that
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
needs you know medication that has to be
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
provided by a specialty
 
05:46:23.230 --> 05:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacy not a regular Pharmacy that is
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
a serious chronic illness you know I
 
05:46:27.948 --> 05:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill will provide
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
support to them uh so I ask that you
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
support this bill as well um and like
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
Susie said you know 19 States have
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
already you know supported this bill
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:46:46.910 --> 05:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you know especially when I get into
 
05:46:51.070 --> 05:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
costs um I paid 20% since I'm a college
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
student still I paid 20% of my um income
 
05:46:58.110 --> 05:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
last year was due to medical
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
expenses um so I have had to force or to
 
05:47:02.600 --> 05:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
expenses um so I have had to force or to
face

05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
face
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
situations where I'm choosing to take my
 
05:47:06.400 --> 05:47:07.830 align:start position:0%
situations where I'm choosing to take my
Factor

05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
05:47:10.750 --> 05:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
or uh pay my rent for college pay my
 
05:47:14.190 --> 05:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
housing or pay for my textbooks or other
 
05:47:17.070 --> 05:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
educational expenses I've had to face
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that decision before and sometimes I've
 
05:47:20.000 --> 05:47:22.430 align:start position:0%
that decision before and sometimes I've
chosen

05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
05:47:27.548 --> 05:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
to not take my Factor because of that or
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
um some you know very hard decisions
 
05:47:30.718 --> 05:47:32.830 align:start position:0%
um some you know very hard decisions
about

05:47:32.830 --> 05:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
um not even going to the hospital if I
 
05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
um or taking ambulances and emergencies
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
like I had in 2022 where I had to go to
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
the ER four times for a different bleeds
 
05:47:48.510 --> 05:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't afford to take an
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance I couldn't afford
 
05:47:55.868 --> 05:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
to stay in the hospital uh in as an
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
impatient uh
 
05:47:57.718 --> 05:47:59.948 align:start position:0%
impatient uh
long

05:47:59.948 --> 05:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:48:03.548 --> 05:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
um and as I'm 23 years old right now I
 
05:48:06.190 --> 05:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
look to the Future and you know in a
 
05:48:07.708 --> 05:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
couple years I'll have to get my own
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance and I'll have to get uh
 
05:48:16.468 --> 05:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
something a plan that will be uh stable
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
enough to cover my
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
Factor um and that's a big priority of
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
mine right now uh looking ahead to the
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
Future as I you know transition out of
 
05:48:31.150 --> 05:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
my father's Insurance um similar to
 
05:48:33.190 --> 05:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
Susie I
 
05:48:36.430 --> 05:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
pay just just as much as as she said cuz
 
05:48:38.910 --> 05:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm on the same medication called him
 
05:48:38.920 --> 05:48:41.868 align:start position:0%
I'm on the same medication called him
Libra

05:48:41.868 --> 05:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
Libra
 
05:48:44.350 --> 05:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
um and I mean that's all I can really
 
05:48:47.868 --> 05:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
say about the expense side of it but
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just want to reiterate the
 
05:48:52.430 --> 05:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
fact of the coupon that we've been that
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing um once again it's
 
05:48:57.310 --> 05:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
just not a coupon it's a it's a whole
 
05:49:00.270 --> 05:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
process of how it works and you know I
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
can explain the process again if nobody
 
05:49:04.468 --> 05:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
understands it or needs some
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarification on it um
 
05:49:09.468 --> 05:49:09.478 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm aware of how it works
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
and so is Susie as well so if nobody has
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
a solid understanding of that I can
 
05:49:18.030 --> 05:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
explain it but yeah if anybody has any
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer but just
 
05:49:23.468 --> 05:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
 
05:49:27.150 --> 05:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
today thank you for coming do we have a
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
question Reverend post thank you and
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and and giving this
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um my question uh revolves
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
around you said you need a special
 
05:49:41.310 --> 05:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy to go to are they all over the
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
state are they far away uh yeah so you
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
know we have regular pharmacies like
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
Walgreens and CVS that you can get
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
regular prescriptions for common
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
medications my medication is not common
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's not generic um it's one of it's
 
05:50:04.030 --> 05:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
produced in you know limited quantities
 
05:50:07.150 --> 05:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
so you know I am on a specialty proy
 
05:50:09.468 --> 05:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
called a CREDO and they've been around
 
05:50:13.150 --> 05:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
for many years um they're older than me
 
05:50:16.270 --> 05:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
and uh I I've used them for about two
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
years now since uh the beginning of
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
2022 and they're all the
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
way I think they're based out of Ohio I
 
05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
may be incorrect on that but they're
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
definitely not based around here but
 
05:50:30.430 --> 05:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
they have locations around here uh where
 
05:50:32.230 --> 05:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate enough to you know I they
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
can ship factor to me the next day or or
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
two days later so
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I hope that answers your questions
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
about where they're at yes it did I I
 
05:50:45.548 --> 05:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
was concerned because I know that if you
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
have issues and you can't get to get
 
05:50:50.750 --> 05:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't get your drugs that that would be
 
05:50:53.390 --> 05:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
an issue so I wanted to make sure that
 
05:50:55.910 --> 05:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to get those
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
drugs so thank you you're
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much thank you uh
 
05:51:16.750 --> 05:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
hello everyone um thank you for having
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
me um my name is krie bue I am an adult
 
05:51:25.670 --> 05:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
living with cystic fibrosis and I'm also
 
05:51:28.510 --> 05:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
a lifelong New Hampshire resident cystic
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
fibrosis is a rare genetic disease that
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
affects many areas of the body one of
 
05:51:35.548 --> 05:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
the primary areas is the lungs where it
 
05:51:37.868 --> 05:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
creates thick sticky mucus which makes
 
05:51:39.868 --> 05:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
it difficult for the individual to
 
05:51:42.430 --> 05:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
breathe this also causes issues with
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
chronic lung infections and frequent
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and even the need for
 
05:51:49.910 --> 05:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
lung transplant in some individuals when
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
I was 5 years old testing confirmed that
 
05:51:54.468 --> 05:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
I had CF as well as my younger sister
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
mallerie at that time my parents are
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
told that most likely we would not live
 
05:52:01.390 --> 05:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
long enough to graduate high school
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
since there are no treatments that could
 
05:52:04.750 --> 05:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
help correct the underlying cause of
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
cystic fibrosis despite this my parents
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
did everything that they could to keep
 
05:52:12.190 --> 05:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
me and my sister healthy they would
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
stress to us the importance of doing
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
treatments that we did have at the time
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
such as antibiotics and Airway clearance
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that we would be healthy
 
05:52:24.150 --> 05:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
enough someday if there was a cure so
 
05:52:27.070 --> 05:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
far there has not been a cure found but
 
05:52:29.070 --> 05:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
there are treatments for Cystic Fibrosis
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
that have improved tremendously over the
 
05:52:34.468 --> 05:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
past 35 years in 2010 I was able to
 
05:52:36.510 --> 05:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
participate in a clinical trial for
 
05:52:39.150 --> 05:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
ptico which was the first medication to
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
address the cause of cystic
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
fibrosis this medication made a
 
05:52:47.468 --> 05:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
difference for me almost immediately and
 
05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
it has helped me stay healthy for nearly
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
eight years even though it was not the
 
05:52:54.510 --> 05:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
medication's fault I became very sick in
 
05:52:56.468 --> 05:52:56.478 align:start position:0%
2018 and
 
05:52:59.110 --> 05:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
2019 to the point where my lung
 
05:53:01.628 --> 05:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
functions were starting to deteriorate
 
05:53:03.990 --> 05:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
bringing the need for a lung transplant
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
closer to my reality I also so thought I
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
was going to need to stop working
 
05:53:10.590 --> 05:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
full-time and things as simple as
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
sleeping were difficult because the
 
05:53:14.270 --> 05:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
mucus in my lungs made it difficult to
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
breathe simple everyday activities were
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
no longer easy and I wasn't able to
 
05:53:21.468 --> 05:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
enjoy my life or being with my family
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
and friends in late 2019 a miracle for
 
05:53:26.948 --> 05:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
most of the CF Community was approved by
 
05:53:30.590 --> 05:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
the fpda traa gave me and so many others
 
05:53:33.190 --> 05:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
a chance at a normal life my health has
 
05:53:35.310 --> 05:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
improved drastically since then even to
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
the point where I ran the boss Boston
 
05:53:39.750 --> 05:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
Marathon in 2022 wow
 
05:53:42.750 --> 05:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
wa I truly believe this medication saved
 
05:53:45.468 --> 05:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
my life however one of the downsides to
 
05:53:49.948 --> 05:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
triaa is the cost this life-changing
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
medication costs over
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year which is impossible for
 
05:53:57.430 --> 05:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of people in people in the
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
CF community community excuse me to
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
afford personally Coplay accumulators
 
05:54:05.670 --> 05:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
will impact me once my time in my
 
05:54:08.430 --> 05:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
current clinical trial ends my employer
 
05:54:10.990 --> 05:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
has told me and I've been at my employer
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
for 20 years so I am on their plan I
 
05:54:16.910 --> 05:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a large choice in the plans
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
that they select um but they have told
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
me my out-of pocket maximum will be
 
05:54:24.990 --> 05:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
$8,000 for triaa even though I have
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
co-pay assistance to cover this amount
 
05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
this is a huge cost and burden that
 
05:54:32.510 --> 05:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
causes great uncertainty and anxiety
 
05:54:34.430 --> 05:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
about finding a new way to cover this
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill with the ability to access co-pay
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
assistance it has helped to ease the
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
anxieties of financial burdens for many
 
05:54:44.750 --> 05:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the seaf community so that they can
 
05:54:46.990 --> 05:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
continue to access life-changing
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
medications I ask that you please stand
 
05:54:50.548 --> 05:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
with those in the chronic illness
 
05:54:52.750 --> 05:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
community and consider the impact that
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
kpe accumulators have on those fighting
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
for a chance to Simply live a healthier
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.830 --> 05:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
you well well thank thank you very much
 
05:55:05.430 --> 05:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
for coming thank you I appreciate your
 
05:55:08.750 --> 05:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
time um I also can say that
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
copay um they're not coupons just from
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
my experience over my life um you have
 
05:55:16.708 --> 05:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
to go through a process with the CL with
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical company um submitting
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
like your wage data and your earnings
 
05:55:25.110 --> 05:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
for them to decide if you're eligible
 
05:55:26.350 --> 05:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
for one of their
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
co-pay assistance programs and when I go
 
05:55:32.910 --> 05:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
to the pharmacy I don't have a card um
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
that looks like a coupon it looks like
 
05:55:37.468 --> 05:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
an insurance card that I give to my
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and they send that out as like
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
a bill um and that's how they get paid I
 
05:55:46.510 --> 05:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any money from that um people
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
who have probas ass since don't have any
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
other benefit other than the company the
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company third party
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
whoever they are paying for that portion
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the men for them so if I have an
 
05:55:59.440 --> 05:56:01.310 align:start position:0%
of the men for them so if I have an
$88,000

05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
$88,000
 
05:56:04.990 --> 05:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
deductible and I receed co-pay
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
assistance they paying for that for me
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of this
 
05:56:13.868 --> 05:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
medication but my insurance company is
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
not going to apply that to what I owe so
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're receiving this money from the
 
05:56:22.590 --> 05:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company but still asking
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
me to pay the
 
05:56:28.070 --> 05:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
$88,000 so what are they doing with the
 
05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
$88,000 that they've already received
 
05:56:33.868 --> 05:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
from the um pharmaceutical company
 
05:56:36.590 --> 05:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's my we will try to find out to the
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
GP bottom of that yeah so that is the
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
main point like just from listening to
 
05:56:42.310 --> 05:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room that you know they
 
05:56:43.788 --> 05:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
are getting the money they're getting
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
paid but then they're expecting the
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
patients to pay it also so that is a
 
05:56:49.868 --> 05:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
huge burden for anybody who's trying to
 
05:56:55.230 --> 05:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.548 --> 05:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
you okay uh Curtis Barry I call you
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
because you're going to take one
 
05:57:01.798 --> 05:57:03.868 align:start position:0%
because you're going to take one
minute

05:57:03.868 --> 05:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
minute
 
05:57:06.868 --> 05:57:06.878 align:start position:0%

05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill I'll try to be even quicker than I
 
05:57:21.548 --> 05:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
put it on on my card Mr chairman because
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of what I wanted to say has
 
05:57:24.270 --> 05:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
already been said but for the record I'm

public health organizations if you see
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
the second page on your packet on the
 
05:57:43.270 --> 05:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
back of it there's a list of all the
 
05:57:43.280 --> 05:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
back of it there's a list of all the
different

05:57:44.230 --> 05:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
organizations uh some of the volunteers
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
of those organizations have already
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
testified uh this afternoon as to their
 
05:57:55.670 --> 05:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
experiences with um with these so-called
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of a co-pay accumulator program
 
05:58:01.150 --> 05:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
as part of their insurance uh but for
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
many cancer patients having a difficulty
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
affording their cost of their
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs uh even if they have
 
05:58:10.708 --> 05:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh Insurance um it's especially true uh
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
for newer drugs including um uh as I
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
said for cancer drugs um even if there's
 
05:58:19.708 --> 05:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
a especially because there may not have
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
been yet in generic equivalent and to
 
05:58:25.230 --> 05:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
help uh temper the high cost of these
 
05:58:28.830 --> 05:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs many individuals are
 
05:58:32.150 --> 05:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um turning to co-pay assistance uh often
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
times offered through manufacturer
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs and other charitable uh
 
05:58:40.270 --> 05:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
assistance programs and as you've
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
heard um the Crux of the problem is
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
these folks will get assistance they'll
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
go to the pharmacy
 
05:58:53.468 --> 05:58:53.478 align:start position:0%
they'll get the assistance paid for for
 
05:58:57.468 --> 05:58:57.478 align:start position:0%
them whatever the dollar amount is um
 
05:58:59.310 --> 05:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
Susie used nice round numbers let's say
 
05:58:59.320 --> 05:59:00.350 align:start position:0%
Susie used nice round numbers let's say
it's

05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:59:00.360 --> 05:59:02.150 align:start position:0%
it's
$500

05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
$500
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
um the $500 is paid on their behalf
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
apparently through a card as we just
 
05:59:07.520 --> 05:59:09.150 align:start position:0%
apparently through a card as we just
heard

05:59:09.150 --> 05:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:59:12.750 --> 05:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of the year these
 
05:59:14.468 --> 05:59:14.478 align:start position:0%
folks are still on the hook for that
 
05:59:16.910 --> 05:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
$500 doesn't count towards their max
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
amount of pocket and that's what this
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill is aiming to try to stop that
 
05:59:24.110 --> 05:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
practice I think at the very beginning
 
05:59:25.750 --> 05:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
of this hearing we kind of went a little
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
sideways I think and maybe what I no
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
100% I understand that's part of the
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
process I think but I think we're trying
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
to get back to really the Crux here I
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
think that's really the problem why
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying why this bill has been
 
05:59:38.708 --> 05:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
brought forward and why we're trying
 
05:59:41.390 --> 05:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to solve um however
 
05:59:42.990 --> 05:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
with the implementation of Senate Bill
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
354 these barriers to co-pay assistance
 
05:59:48.030 --> 05:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
would be removed and it would require
 
05:59:50.270 --> 05:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
all payments made on behalf of patients
 
05:59:53.270 --> 05:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
either directly on their behalf or or
 
05:59:55.230 --> 05:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
whether directly on their behalf or or
 
05:59:57.430 --> 05:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
by some other organization be counted
 
06:00:00.070 --> 06:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
towards the overall outof pocket maximum
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
or they're deductible and requiring
 
06:00:03.990 --> 06:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance carriers to do so will
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
protect cancer patients from Surprise
 
06:00:05.718 --> 06:00:06.590 align:start position:0%
protect cancer patients from Surprise
bill

06:00:06.590 --> 06:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:00:08.510 --> 06:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
and treatment delays as well as allowing
 
06:00:10.670 --> 06:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to utilize the full benefit
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
of co-pay assistance programs and just
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
to be clear s SP 354 is not a mandate a
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
coverage mandate and does not require
 
06:00:20.030 --> 06:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies cover any
 
06:00:22.350 --> 06:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
particular drug or class of drugs
 
06:00:24.030 --> 06:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in this legislation prevents
 
06:00:25.708 --> 06:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
insurers from using their existing
 
06:00:27.548 --> 06:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
utilization management tools such as
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
step therapy or prior authorization
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
we're only addressing co-pay assistance
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is being used by patients for drugs
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
that their insurance company is already
 
06:00:38.270 --> 06:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
made the decision to cover and that
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
their doctor has determined that they
 
06:00:43.230 --> 06:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
need um patients uh still have plenty of
 
06:00:44.510 --> 06:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
skin in the game in the sense that
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're still paying their premiums um
 
06:00:49.708 --> 06:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
and that patients living with chronic
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
illnesses don't always have the luxury
 
06:00:54.990 --> 06:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
of foregoing their uh their treatment
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
and um it can't always just easily um
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
switch insurance plans as we're
 
06:01:03.390 --> 06:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
suggested previously by uh the insurance
 
06:01:06.030 --> 06:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
department um so with that Mr chairman I
 
06:01:08.350 --> 06:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
will uh stop testifying although I will
 
06:01:10.708 --> 06:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
just mention last evening I did send to
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the full Committee just so you all have
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
it in case you might have missed it in
 
06:01:18.150 --> 06:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
your email um some information they're
 
06:01:19.868 --> 06:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
very large files I didn't want to print
 
06:01:21.390 --> 06:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
them all out there's about several
 
06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
hundred Pages worth of information
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
there's a study by the AIDS Institute uh
 
06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
the um the Pioneer
 
06:01:33.830 --> 06:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
Institute and uh the uh Global Healthy
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
Living Foundation which actually has an
 
06:01:37.868 --> 06:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
analysis of all the 19 states that have
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
already passed this policy um which does
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
show as it's been previously mentioned
 
06:01:48.430 --> 06:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
that there has not been an increase um
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh in premiums other than a normal what
 
06:01:52.868 --> 06:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
we would see as a normal rate of
 
06:01:55.230 --> 06:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
increase that you would see anyways uh
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
for um for insurance increases and
 
06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
premiums but it was not based on um on
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
this policy being enacted so with that
 
06:02:05.390 --> 06:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions or
 
06:02:07.468 --> 06:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
try to Mr
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
chairman okay any questions see I think
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.430 --> 06:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
out I I would love to talk about
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
maximizers though if you really wanted
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
to because they're are quite we're all
 
06:02:21.990 --> 06:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
have this in the subcommittee and I'm
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
sure you'll attend this I would happy to
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
talk in subcommittee I do have a
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
question okay here you go it's a nothing
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
question well
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's yeah
 
06:02:40.110 --> 06:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
we have insurance companies on one hand
 
06:02:43.110 --> 06:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
who are desperately trying to keep uh
 
06:02:45.590 --> 06:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
premiums down we have patients that are
 
06:02:45.600 --> 06:02:47.788 align:start position:0%
premiums down we have patients that are
in

06:02:47.788 --> 06:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:50.190 --> 06:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
need I've done a little bit of of
 
06:02:50.200 --> 06:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
need I've done a little bit of of
looking

06:02:51.990 --> 06:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
looking
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
into what drug companies make on drugs
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
and especially some of these drugs and
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
no one has mentioned that maybe the drug
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
company should take some responsibility
 
06:03:05.270 --> 06:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
for this what do you think of that yes
 
06:03:08.750 --> 06:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes Don chis did mention it there should
 
06:03:10.990 --> 06:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
be some responsibility there it can't be
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
all on the raid paays I have said in
 
06:03:14.400 --> 06:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
all on the raid paays I have said in
other

06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
hearings and I will say it here
 
06:03:21.310 --> 06:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
again that I have no problem whatsoever
 
06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
laying blame at the feet of
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies I have no
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
problem laying the blame at the feet of
 
06:03:30.430 --> 06:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry I think there's
 
06:03:33.310 --> 06:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
lots of blame to go around I do not
 
06:03:35.310 --> 06:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
represent the pharmaceutical industry I
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
do not represent Lord knows they will
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
tell you I do not represent the
 
06:03:38.878 --> 06:03:39.990 align:start position:0%
tell you I do not represent the
insurance

06:03:39.990 --> 06:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
industry um I represent cancer patients
 
06:03:47.948 --> 06:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
and their families and I will tell you
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
that with the system that we're living
 
06:03:51.670 --> 06:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
in right
 
06:03:51.680 --> 06:03:53.628 align:start position:0%
in right
now

06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
that SB
 
06:04:01.468 --> 06:04:01.478 align:start position:0%
354 is a solution to help
 
06:04:05.310 --> 06:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
people right now now if you're looking
 
06:04:07.468 --> 06:04:07.478 align:start position:0%
for other solutions to to help solve the
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
high cost of of of of of drugs we that's
 
06:04:14.788 --> 06:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
a much larger convers sorry talk with my
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
hands much larger conversation
 
06:04:19.070 --> 06:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative that that this bill is
 
06:04:21.070 --> 06:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
not going to solve all pro all the
 
06:04:23.310 --> 06:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
problems with the high cost of drugs
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is to
 
06:04:28.708 --> 06:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
help consumers I can stop talking with
 
06:04:30.110 --> 06:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
my hands I'm sorry this will help
 
06:04:33.070 --> 06:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
consumers in real time right
 
06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
now um that that are getting help to pay
 
06:04:40.670 --> 06:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the high cost of drugs and Lord
 
06:04:45.310 --> 06:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
um the help they're getting needs to
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
count towards their their deductible and
 
06:04:53.948 --> 06:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
their maximum out of pocket cost per
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
year that's what this is addressing
 
06:04:57.468 --> 06:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
right now and that's really I think what
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on right now what
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about we can I'd love to
 
06:05:02.310 --> 06:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
talk to you about that offline we could
 
06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
talk about that for hours trust me
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
because it's the larer problem but
 
06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to solve it right now I
 
06:05:10.468 --> 06:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
don't think thank you very much of
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
course okay uh this time I'll do Heidi
 
06:05:19.150 --> 06:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.230 --> 06:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
06:05:41.788 --> 06:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record my
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi croll I work at Gallagher
 
06:05:44.910 --> 06:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
Callahan and
 
06:05:47.190 --> 06:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
gartell um and I'm representing ahip
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans um so
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to sp sp
 
06:05:55.750 --> 06:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
354 had a lots of notes written out and
 
06:05:56.990 --> 06:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm going to try to jump
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
around to address some of the questions
 
06:06:00.910 --> 06:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
that have come up
 
06:06:03.868 --> 06:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
um our concern is that this bill will
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of health insurance
 
06:06:08.230 --> 06:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens and employers
 
06:06:11.150 --> 06:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
um who are in the fully insured Market
 
06:06:12.750 --> 06:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
um the bill does nothing as you've heard
 
06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
to control the sing prices of
 
06:06:16.430 --> 06:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs for patients and
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
instead um rewards drug makers for
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
steering patients toward more expensive
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
brand name drugs um patients access to
 
06:06:25.390 --> 06:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
Affordable healthc Care in New
 
06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fully insured Market which
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
is the sole Target of this bill um we do
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
believe will be negatively impacted by
 
06:06:31.798 --> 06:06:32.868 align:start position:0%
believe will be negatively impacted by
this

06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
trying to decide where to begin uh I
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
think well tell us why this how this
 
06:06:47.390 --> 06:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
money how someone can the money and you
 
06:06:49.628 --> 06:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
don't count it to the thing can can you
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
help us out with that one so first of
 
06:06:53.150 --> 06:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
all I would say that carriers are
 
06:06:55.990 --> 06:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the patient assistance
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
coupons discounts cash cards whatever
 
06:07:01.310 --> 06:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
you want to call them carriers are
 
06:07:04.990 --> 06:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
focused on what is coming from Pharma um
 
06:07:08.030 --> 06:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
we uh do not track we don't have an
 
06:07:10.868 --> 06:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
interest in tracking as far as I've been
 
06:07:14.030 --> 06:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
told assistance that's coming from your
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
Aunt Sally your local church your
 
06:07:20.708 --> 06:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe page um and the reason is that
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
this the source of the assistance
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
matters and it matters because when you
 
06:07:27.948 --> 06:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
get assistance from your Aunt Sally or
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
your GoFundMe page or your local church
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
they are just trying to help they don't
 
06:07:34.990 --> 06:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
care necessarily what drug you're on
 
06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're not using coupons and I'll use
 
06:07:38.910 --> 06:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
that in a very generic way they're not
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
using assistance to try to corner market
 
06:07:45.468 --> 06:07:45.478 align:start position:0%
share and drive people to a particular
 
06:07:47.990 --> 06:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
more expensive brand named drug when
 
06:07:50.070 --> 06:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
there are lower cost Alternatives that
 
06:07:52.510 --> 06:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
is not what your family and friends are
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
doing when they are offering you
 
06:07:55.868 --> 06:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
assistance when the assistance comes
 
06:07:59.670 --> 06:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
from Pharma that is exactly the purpose
 
06:08:03.788 --> 06:08:03.798 align:start position:0%
of the assistance it is a market frankly
 
06:08:04.990 --> 06:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what we've heard in this
 
06:08:07.628 --> 06:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
testimony today what we've heard in this
 
06:08:11.110 --> 06:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
testimony is very unique
 
06:08:13.628 --> 06:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
drugs for a very
 
06:08:13.638 --> 06:08:15.310 align:start position:0%
drugs for a very
unique

06:08:15.310 --> 06:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
unique
 
06:08:15.320 --> 06:08:17.030 align:start position:0%
unique
uh

06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:21.310 --> 06:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
ailments that there is no other drug
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
because we always talk about you know in
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
terms of the other bill it was you know
 
06:08:27.070 --> 06:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
if there was some other drug that you
 
06:08:30.468 --> 06:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
can choose but um if we're talking about
 
06:08:33.150 --> 06:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
cystic fibrosis and there's only one
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
medication you can take and it has this
 
06:08:41.548 --> 06:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
outrageous uh cost right and so why
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
would the insurance company take money
 
06:08:47.628 --> 06:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
if they if offer assistance other words
 
06:08:49.150 --> 06:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
if the pharmaceutical company is
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
offering assistance and we'll forget
 
06:08:53.510 --> 06:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
about what form it's in but there's some
 
06:08:56.430 --> 06:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
money coming down because the pharmacy's
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
happy that he got the money he got
 
06:09:00.910 --> 06:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they were looking for what the
 
06:09:03.270 --> 06:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
computer told them they needed to get
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
they got it they could apply it to
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
whoever going to pay it so what I'm
 
06:09:11.708 --> 06:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
asking is is if we're if we're really
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
narrowing it down to just these
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
unique medical conditions that only have
 
06:09:19.680 --> 06:09:20.510 align:start position:0%
unique medical conditions that only have
one

06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
drug that can
 
06:09:26.670 --> 06:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
solve why would we turn down why would
 
06:09:31.230 --> 06:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
you not respect the fact that the that
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company is giving a
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
they're calling assistance a subsidy
 
06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
they're doing something that something
 
06:09:42.468 --> 06:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
that made that Pharmacy happy okay that
 
06:09:43.990 --> 06:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing that why would you be
 
06:09:46.948 --> 06:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to that if there is no other
 
06:09:48.628 --> 06:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
medicine to
 
06:09:52.270 --> 06:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
take so um my understanding based on one
 
06:09:54.990 --> 06:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
analysis I saw is that 88% of brand
 
06:09:57.390 --> 06:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
named drugs with manufacturer coupons
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
were medications for which lower cost
 
06:10:01.788 --> 06:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
Alternatives were available so under
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
that math that would leave the 12% of
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about the that goes
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
back to
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
555 this bill this bill it talks about
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
that you but that's from the testimony
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
we hurt now maybe that's we're getting
 
06:10:17.468 --> 06:10:17.478 align:start position:0%
limited testimony maybe we're not
 
06:10:19.350 --> 06:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
getting as focused the way this bill is
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
written and certainly I didn't think
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
this committee is more than motivated to
 
06:10:29.070 --> 06:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
narrow it to what we heard in today's
 
06:10:32.830 --> 06:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
testimony which is to solve these people
 
06:10:35.788 --> 06:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
who I I would assume they I mean I would
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
assume a human feedback is on on
 
06:10:39.788 --> 06:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I mean I would assume like
 
06:10:41.468 --> 06:10:41.478 align:start position:0%
Social Security or you know Social
 
06:10:43.390 --> 06:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
Security you know but maybe not I don't
 
06:10:45.628 --> 06:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
know I mean the fact that they're still
 
06:10:47.468 --> 06:10:47.478 align:start position:0%
in the market you know in the insurance
 
06:10:49.628 --> 06:10:49.638 align:start position:0%
you open market you know obviously the
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
employer is going to set the co-pay or
 
06:10:54.270 --> 06:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
the high you know the deductible at what
 
06:10:55.948 --> 06:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
what they think is right and has nothing
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do with the individual pay you know
 
06:11:01.868 --> 06:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
employee but what I'm saying is if if we
 
06:11:03.788 --> 06:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
can narrow
 
06:11:06.030 --> 06:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
this to
 
06:11:08.468 --> 06:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
those drugs which really don't have
 
06:11:11.788 --> 06:11:11.798 align:start position:0%
anything else and that if the drug
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
company is willing to um help that
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
deductible for that
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
employee knowing full well that you
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
could say is well they're just raising
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
the price at the back end that that
 
06:11:26.910 --> 06:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to get whatever they just
 
06:11:28.910 --> 06:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
donated they're going to get back from
 
06:11:31.990 --> 06:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
you okay but that you know from the from
 
06:11:34.270 --> 06:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
the insurance company but if it's just
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
is if we were to narrow it to these
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
unique medical conditions that are are
 
06:11:44.350 --> 06:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
that these are the only drugs available
 
06:11:47.548 --> 06:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
that are that but you're saying is you
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
know that what you know is that it's 80%
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
or they do have competitive products yes
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and the bill
 
06:11:58.270 --> 06:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
talks about any amounts paid by the
 
06:12:01.788 --> 06:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
enrol e or paid on behalf of the aoli so
 
06:12:04.430 --> 06:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think the bill whether intentionally
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
or not intent Al muddies the waters
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
about the source the source of the
 
06:12:12.350 --> 06:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
assistance we want to make sure that yes
 
06:12:15.868 --> 06:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
if if if if if grandma wants to make the
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
payment we we will be more than willing
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
to take that money and apply it to the
 
06:12:21.948 --> 06:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
right and I think you know again this is
 
06:12:24.190 --> 06:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
not this bill is not about whether or
 
06:12:27.150 --> 06:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
not people can use the assistance it's
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not the assistance gets
 
06:12:31.628 --> 06:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
counted toward their deductible right in
 
06:12:33.190 --> 06:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
terms of whether what's coming out of
 
06:12:35.788 --> 06:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
their pocket versus what's
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
because what we heard today is pretty
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
outrageous that that there is this
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
assistance that money is coming in that
 
06:12:45.948 --> 06:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
you're the pharmacy's collecting that
 
06:12:48.150 --> 06:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
money and yet at the end of the day
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
you're not showing it on their on their
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh what is the benefits what do we call
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
the uh and again I think it depends on
 
06:12:57.310 --> 06:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's coming from the Pharma or
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
not because if it's coming from Pharma
 
06:13:01.110 --> 06:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's a whatever you want to call it
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
a coupon patient assistance discount
 
06:13:05.910 --> 06:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it's coming from Pharma to the
 
06:13:07.708 --> 06:13:07.718 align:start position:0%
to the pharmacy and then back up to
 
06:13:09.390 --> 06:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
Pharm so do you re do you have the
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacy refund the money that the
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
person gave when you did
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
disallowed I mean what we just heard is
 
06:13:17.948 --> 06:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
that there you're there's double
 
06:13:20.510 --> 06:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
payments so maybe maybe the the the
 
06:13:22.310 --> 06:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
person who's taking the double payments
 
06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
is the is the the pharmacy maybe the
 
06:13:27.948 --> 06:13:27.958 align:start position:0%
pharmacy's been is holding on to this
 
06:13:32.548 --> 06:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
payment I can tell you carriers are not
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
holding to the extra payment the the
 
06:13:36.718 --> 06:13:38.788 align:start position:0%
holding to the extra payment the the
issue

06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:13:43.230 --> 06:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
is PBM must is is PBM must be hold on
 
06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
that money who's hold on of that money I
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
mean if you're not allowing it the the
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
fact of the fact of the matter is if the
 
06:13:51.788 --> 06:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturer is
 
06:13:54.270 --> 06:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
essentially discounting their price the
 
06:13:55.948 --> 06:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
price of their
 
06:13:58.708 --> 06:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
drug right and the patient is simply
 
06:13:58.718 --> 06:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
drug right and the patient is simply
paying

06:13:59.990 --> 06:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:14:02.910 --> 06:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
their their share okay so you're you're
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
holding up that maybe what's happening
 
06:14:09.390 --> 06:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
is that that assistance money is then
 
06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
reducing what the insurance company has
 
06:14:15.628 --> 06:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the pharmacy the PBM has to
 
06:14:18.270 --> 06:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
reimburse the pharmacy for that
 
06:14:21.070 --> 06:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
medication you're saying it's coming off
 
06:14:22.990 --> 06:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
at a different end it's not coming off
 
06:14:26.030 --> 06:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
on the consumer end on their co-pay it's
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
coming off to how much is build uh uh
 
06:14:31.510 --> 06:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it I'm saying basically that
 
06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
Pharma is paying itself with some of
 
06:14:36.670 --> 06:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
these so then when they come time to
 
06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
Bill Bill you the build the pharmacy or
 
06:14:40.830 --> 06:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
build excuse me the build the insurance
 
06:14:43.948 --> 06:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
company or the PBM that there is a
 
06:14:47.948 --> 06:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
discount on that billing that reflects
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
this assistance dollars I don't know if
 
06:14:51.390 --> 06:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
it's showing up as a discount but it's
 
06:14:53.868 --> 06:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
effectively a discount let me see if I
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
can give you an example and maybe this
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
will help um so in the example that I
 
06:15:00.548 --> 06:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
had come up with let's take someone who
 
06:15:04.788 --> 06:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
has not yet met their $5,000 deductible
 
06:15:07.868 --> 06:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
right the option of taking either $1,000
 
06:15:09.868 --> 06:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
and I guess here I'm more focusing on
 
06:15:11.430 --> 06:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
where there's an Al a competitive
 
06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
alternative but I just want to
 
06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
illustrate why carriers are honed in on
 
06:15:19.150 --> 06:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
this issue so they the patient has an
 
06:15:21.548 --> 06:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
option of taking a, drug that offers a
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
$900 coupon which means they would pay
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
$100 out of pocket or the option of
 
06:15:28.830 --> 06:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
taking a lower cost alternative that
 
06:15:30.270 --> 06:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
comes with
 
06:15:33.070 --> 06:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
$125 out of pocket cost okay they're
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to choose the drug with the coupon
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
because it means a lower outof pocket
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
cost for themselves $100 instead of
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
125 under SB 354 instead of just the
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
patients $100 expense counting toward
 
06:15:47.280 --> 06:15:48.628 align:start position:0%
patients $100 expense counting toward
the

06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:15:51.788 --> 06:15:51.798 align:start position:0%
deductible the value of the coupon and
 
06:15:54.070 --> 06:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'm using coupon very generically the
 
06:15:57.190 --> 06:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
$900 manufacturer discount would be
 
06:16:00.510 --> 06:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
counted to meaning $1,000 would get
 
06:16:02.830 --> 06:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
counted toward the patients deductible
 
06:16:05.628 --> 06:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
not just the patients 100
 
06:16:08.590 --> 06:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
$100 $100 that they took out of their
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
pocket right you do understand that's
 
06:16:13.070 --> 06:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
not the testimony we gotten today the
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
testimony we got today is they don't see
 
06:16:20.590 --> 06:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
that N9 that extra $900 showed up and
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
that that they see that they still have
 
06:16:26.150 --> 06:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
not met their personal deductible other
 
06:16:28.150 --> 06:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
than paying that $100 so they're getting
 
06:16:29.830 --> 06:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit in my example they're
 
06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit of the $900 they're
 
06:16:34.430 --> 06:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
paying $100 out of pocket and the $100
 
06:16:37.948 --> 06:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
is getting being counted toward their
 
06:16:40.430 --> 06:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
deductible so the from Pharma
 
06:16:42.190 --> 06:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
perspective what they're trying to do is
 
06:16:44.510 --> 06:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
put patients on an accelerated path
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
toward meeting their deductible because
 
06:16:50.670 --> 06:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
once the deductible is met in the PES as
 
06:16:53.468 --> 06:16:53.478 align:start position:0%
far as I understand Pharma withdraws the
 
06:16:55.868 --> 06:16:55.878 align:start position:0%
assistance okay once the deductible has
 
06:16:58.270 --> 06:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
been met Pharma withdraws the assistance
 
06:17:01.270 --> 06:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the cost of these high cost drugs
 
06:17:03.070 --> 06:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's competition or not is
 
06:17:05.468 --> 06:17:05.478 align:start position:0%
then shifted to the premium pay
 
06:17:07.270 --> 06:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
and our concern is that when there are
 
06:17:09.548 --> 06:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
lower cost Alternatives we want people
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be looking at those we understand
 
06:17:12.670 --> 06:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
that there is not always going to be
 
06:17:14.708 --> 06:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
lower cost Alternatives but when there
 
06:17:16.468 --> 06:17:16.478 align:start position:0%
are we think people should be looking at
 
06:17:19.548 --> 06:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
those first okay the problem gets worse
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
um in my example and the problem is that
 
06:17:25.110 --> 06:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
our concern is that 354 adds an
 
06:17:26.830 --> 06:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
incentive for drug manufacturers to
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
increase their drug prices so when the
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
example I use where the patient has the
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
$5,000 deductible a manufacturer would
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
have the incentive to raise their price
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the extreme case to $5,000 for the
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
month they give the patient a
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
$4,900 discount coupon assistance
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it the patient
 
06:17:49.830 --> 06:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
pays their $100 out of pocket and uh now
 
06:17:51.590 --> 06:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
the patient has met their deductible in
 
06:17:55.390 --> 06:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
one month and pharma's scheme it has
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
premium payers paying for $5,000 per
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
month drug for the remaining 11 months
 
06:18:03.628 --> 06:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
of the year even though there may be
 
06:18:06.310 --> 06:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
lower cost alternative out there so that
 
06:18:09.468 --> 06:18:09.478 align:start position:0%
is our concern with this bill got it so
 
06:18:11.830 --> 06:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have two folds we have the issue of
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
where does this money go how is it
 
06:18:16.830 --> 06:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
credited okay and but I have to admit I
 
06:18:19.548 --> 06:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
always thought the purpose of a PBM was
 
06:18:21.910 --> 06:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
that they're negotiating a price over a
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
year that they're getting and that they
 
06:18:27.150 --> 06:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
the far the Pharma can't just go raising
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
prices willy-nilly because they have a
 
06:18:33.190 --> 06:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
contract with the PBM uh formulary that
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
that they're locked into for a year but
 
06:18:38.430 --> 06:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong well this in these cases
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
they may not these drugs may or may not
 
06:18:42.270 --> 06:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
be on the formulary and they may be
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
placed off the form anyways and they're
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
just paying the rack price I'm just I
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
was trying to illustrate the incentive
 
06:18:51.390 --> 06:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
the lack of an incentive right for a
 
06:18:53.548 --> 06:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
farmer to kind of keep try to keep a lid
 
06:18:57.510 --> 06:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
on prices um I mean we do see there's a
 
06:19:00.190 --> 06:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
lot of shortfalls with the bill um we've
 
06:19:03.230 --> 06:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
talked some about um there's there's
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
more types of lower cost Alternatives
 
06:19:08.070 --> 06:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
than just generics there's biosimilars
 
06:19:09.948 --> 06:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
there's therapeutic equivalents and in
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
some cases there's even just
 
06:19:13.030 --> 06:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter medications that in
 
06:19:17.230 --> 06:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
combination essentially amount to um uh
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
prescription drug um so that's not
 
06:19:22.910 --> 06:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
addressed in the bill um we would like
 
06:19:24.670 --> 06:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
to see more consumer protections for
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
example if some form of assistance
 
06:19:28.270 --> 06:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it is made
 
06:19:30.150 --> 06:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
available to a patient it should be made
 
06:19:32.430 --> 06:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
available by Pharma for the entire plan
 
06:19:33.990 --> 06:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
year they shouldn't do this bait and
 
06:19:36.510 --> 06:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
switch the deductible has been met they
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
withdraw the uh withdraw it and they
 
06:19:41.468 --> 06:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
should also be allowing consumers to
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
make informed choices by letting them
 
06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
know when the patient is in their open
 
06:19:47.830 --> 06:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment period or the business the
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
employer offering the assistant is in
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
the open enrollment um
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
informing uh those consumers if any
 
06:19:57.708 --> 06:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any changes in the
 
06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh value of the assistance is it going
 
06:20:01.990 --> 06:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
away is it being decreased increased so
 
06:20:03.468 --> 06:20:03.478 align:start position:0%
that people can be making informed
 
06:20:03.478 --> 06:20:07.110 align:start position:0%
that people can be making informed
choices

06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.548 --> 06:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
um we also um we don't agree that uh
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
maximizer programs should be banned um
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
they are very beneficial to patients and
 
06:20:18.590 --> 06:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
premium payers and we should not be
 
06:20:20.910 --> 06:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
passing laws that harm New Hampshire's
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
Healthcare consumers um and I think um
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Dunlap will talk more about this
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
but there are programs that are offer
 
06:20:29.430 --> 06:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
essentially capturing the full value of
 
06:20:30.750 --> 06:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
coupons that are available for
 
06:20:33.070 --> 06:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers spreading that over out
 
06:20:34.830 --> 06:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
over the course of a year and and
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
allowing these patients to get those
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
very expensive drugs for $0 $5 very low
 
06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
cost um cost sharing um and finally we
 
06:20:46.430 --> 06:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that this bill there should be
 
06:20:49.628 --> 06:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
notification requirements from the um
 
06:20:51.310 --> 06:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufactures to the
 
06:20:53.230 --> 06:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
carriers when these types of assistance
 
06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
are being made available um disclose the
 
06:20:58.190 --> 06:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
name of the enrol E the name of the drug
 
06:21:00.030 --> 06:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of the coupon any other sort
 
06:21:02.110 --> 06:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
of terms and conditions as you heard
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
from one of the prior speakers they
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
essentially have something that looks
 
06:21:07.868 --> 06:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
like an insurance card at the same time
 
06:21:09.670 --> 06:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
that they're at the counter maybe um
 
06:21:11.070 --> 06:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
with their with their normal insurance
 
06:21:13.468 --> 06:21:13.478 align:start position:0%
card and making a making a payment out
 
06:21:16.628 --> 06:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
of their pocket um sometimes the
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacy systems um will allow the
 
06:21:23.070 --> 06:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company to see that some sort
 
06:21:24.670 --> 06:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
of assistance has also been playing a
 
06:21:27.868 --> 06:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
role other times those systems do not um
 
06:21:30.670 --> 06:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
and so if we are being asked in any
 
06:21:34.110 --> 06:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances to apply assistance to the
 
06:21:34.120 --> 06:21:35.230 align:start position:0%
circumstances to apply assistance to the
deduc

06:21:35.230 --> 06:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
deduc
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
the first step is we need to know about
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
the assistance and right now we don't
 
06:21:39.320 --> 06:21:40.708 align:start position:0%
the assistance and right now we don't
always

06:21:40.708 --> 06:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
always
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
know um so I'm happy to try to answer
 
06:21:44.468 --> 06:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:21:48.830 --> 06:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
and okay representative spear I see if
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
if we would kind of amend this bill to
 
06:21:52.990 --> 06:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
cover many of the things you talked
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
about uh and also what you talked about
 
06:22:00.430 --> 06:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I'm I would also
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
add to that
 
06:22:07.468 --> 06:22:07.478 align:start position:0%
is that in the case where we would just
 
06:22:09.628 --> 06:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
limit this to some of the kinds of
 
06:22:11.548 --> 06:22:11.558 align:start position:0%
situations that people are talking about
 
06:22:13.430 --> 06:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
here where there is no competition for
 
06:22:13.440 --> 06:22:14.310 align:start position:0%
here where there is no competition for
the

06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:22:16.590 --> 06:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
drug I think they're usually typically
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
tier five drugs in the formulary where
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's no competition and there's only
 
06:22:25.750 --> 06:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
the one drug and it's very expensive
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
which I hate to begin with but that's
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
what it is that doesn't mean next year
 
06:22:33.868 --> 06:22:33.878 align:start position:0%
there won't be in other words so if we
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
ever did such an amendment there has to
 
06:22:38.190 --> 06:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
be some time considered that if
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
competition does get in there that that
 
06:22:43.868 --> 06:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
gets taken into account so that we're
 
06:22:47.830 --> 06:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
not uh I don't know uh supporting a drug
 
06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
for which there now is a lower
 
06:22:51.390 --> 06:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
alternative that has come on the market
 
06:22:52.670 --> 06:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
and they're coming on quicker and
 
06:22:55.030 --> 06:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
quicker so I I think that has to be
 
06:22:57.190 --> 06:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
added to your list of sure I would agree
 
06:23:01.390 --> 06:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.230 --> 06:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
y thank you so um
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
do you know why the the woman that spoke
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
earlier um she made a payment for her
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
son and they didn't use that towards the
 
06:23:21.110 --> 06:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
deductible why would that be an
 
06:23:21.120 --> 06:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
deductible why would that be an
issue

06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:23:26.708 --> 06:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that again if a
 
06:23:29.230 --> 06:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
family member a friend a church a
 
06:23:31.990 --> 06:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe you know if PE if if a patient
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
is getting money from from some a source
 
06:23:41.070 --> 06:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
like that um and they're going to the
 
06:23:43.070 --> 06:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
either you know the pharmacy counter or
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
the virtual Pharmacy Counter um the
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and the carrier are not
 
06:23:51.708 --> 06:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
really going to ask you know where they
 
06:23:55.030 --> 06:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
got the money to be making their their
 
06:23:56.468 --> 06:23:56.478 align:start position:0%
cost Shar their you know their out- of-
 
06:23:59.510 --> 06:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
pocket payment um
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a good answer for it un
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
I mean unless she was directly trying to
 
06:24:08.750 --> 06:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
make a payment to the carrier toward a
 
06:24:11.310 --> 06:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
deductible I I I don't know I don't have
 
06:24:12.830 --> 06:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
a good answer for the question but what
 
06:24:16.948 --> 06:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
I'm saying and the reason that again you
 
06:24:20.030 --> 06:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
know carriers are not concerned about
 
06:24:21.750 --> 06:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
those sources of assistance because
 
06:24:23.430 --> 06:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
again those people are making
 
06:24:26.350 --> 06:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
contributions to that patient because
 
06:24:27.788 --> 06:24:27.798 align:start position:0%
they just want to help they're not
 
06:24:29.868 --> 06:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
trying to corner market share they're
 
06:24:32.430 --> 06:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
not trying to game the system and I have
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
all kinds of information which I don't
 
06:24:36.190 --> 06:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
won't get into to today there's plenty
 
06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
of evidence that coupons or you know I
 
06:24:40.990 --> 06:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
use coupons very generically that is
 
06:24:43.948 --> 06:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
exactly what CP that Pharma tries to do
 
06:24:45.910 --> 06:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
with with the assistance it's a it's a
 
06:24:48.910 --> 06:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
marketing Ploy um but with respect to
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
your question
 
06:24:53.868 --> 06:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
um you know I guess if she had simply
 
06:24:56.910 --> 06:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
given her son the money directly and
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
then he had gone to the pharmacy to make
 
06:25:00.628 --> 06:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
his payment I don't see that there would
 
06:25:02.350 --> 06:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
have been any problem we will certainly
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
whatever if we're going to pass anything
 
06:25:05.390 --> 06:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
specifically identify that and clarify
 
06:25:11.270 --> 06:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
that in in a bill that would say that
 
06:25:11.280 --> 06:25:12.350 align:start position:0%
that in in a bill that would say that
that

06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:25:16.830 --> 06:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's this is only about assistance from
 
06:25:19.910 --> 06:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical manufacturer that's
 
06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
the only one we care about
 
06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative Emon thank you Mr chair
 
06:25:27.350 --> 06:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions um I
 
06:25:29.310 --> 06:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
guess help
 
06:25:31.788 --> 06:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
me validate my understanding and and
 
06:25:33.990 --> 06:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong there there's two
 
06:25:37.430 --> 06:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
ISS ues with this right so the
 
06:25:40.150 --> 06:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
deductible that the patient pays let's
 
06:25:42.390 --> 06:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
say a patient has a $1,000 deductible
 
06:25:45.510 --> 06:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
and they get $1,000 in co-pay assistance
 
06:25:47.948 --> 06:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
that doesn't count towards it if it did
 
06:25:50.350 --> 06:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
count the insurance company would get
 
06:25:50.360 --> 06:25:51.868 align:start position:0%
count the insurance company would get
,000

06:25:51.868 --> 06:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
,000
 
06:25:54.548 --> 06:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
fewer and would have to eat that cost
 
06:25:56.110 --> 06:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
somehow right so that cost would have to
 
06:25:59.468 --> 06:25:59.478 align:start position:0%
get spread out to other rid payers is
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's the first half of it that
 
06:26:04.350 --> 06:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
I see is that correct
 
06:26:07.708 --> 06:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
so the issue is um yes I mean the the
 
06:26:09.390 --> 06:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
assistance coming from Pharma is
 
06:26:11.830 --> 06:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
designed to accelerate the patient to
 
06:26:14.190 --> 06:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
meet their deductible at which point
 
06:26:17.590 --> 06:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
they withdraw the assistance and now the
 
06:26:19.990 --> 06:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
more in the cases where there are
 
06:26:22.350 --> 06:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
competitive lower cost Alternatives the
 
06:26:24.548 --> 06:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
patient is now taking a more expensive
 
06:26:26.750 --> 06:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
drug because they were you know kind of
 
06:26:29.708 --> 06:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
lured into taking it and you know the
 
06:26:31.868 --> 06:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
other half is the disincentive or the
 
06:26:33.310 --> 06:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
the Mis incentives for the Pharma
 
06:26:35.750 --> 06:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
company so there's the one half is the
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company's getting less money
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
because the deductible is met sooner and
 
06:26:42.750 --> 06:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not getting the patients
 
06:26:45.230 --> 06:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
money as they would normally but they
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't care and
 
06:26:48.830 --> 06:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
and well they're they're they'll be
 
06:26:51.468 --> 06:26:51.478 align:start position:0%
getting fewer dollars than they normally
 
06:26:53.070 --> 06:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
do no the Assumption was that they were
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
getting double paid that's that's what
 
06:26:56.910 --> 06:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
we heard today was they were getting
 
06:26:57.910 --> 06:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
double play they were getting the
 
06:27:00.990 --> 06:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
assistance and not crediting that still
 
06:27:03.548 --> 06:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
making the patient pay the uh the full
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
under this
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
under this bill the requirement would be
 
06:27:08.788 --> 06:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
that the value of the coupon has to be
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
counted toward the deductible in
 
06:27:12.788 --> 06:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
addition to any outof pocket expense so
 
06:27:14.310 --> 06:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
putting aside the disincentives or the
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mis incentives that this would create
 
06:27:19.390 --> 06:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
for the Pharma company in in the normal
 
06:27:21.788 --> 06:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
course you're you're not getting
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
additional money from the patient
 
06:27:27.390 --> 06:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
through their deductible right ignore
 
06:27:30.390 --> 06:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
the the disincentives if you had to if
 
06:27:33.310 --> 06:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
you had to include the the co-pay
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
assistance towards the patients
 
06:27:37.788 --> 06:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
deductible now you're not so you're
 
06:27:40.510 --> 06:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
getting you'd be getting less dollars
 
06:27:41.948 --> 06:27:41.958 align:start position:0%
right I mean I don't know if this is
 
06:27:43.750 --> 06:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at or not but I mean
 
06:27:45.390 --> 06:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
you know for the for the patient who's
 
06:27:46.670 --> 06:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
on one of these drugs where they're
 
06:27:48.788 --> 06:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
getting assistance from Pharma so in the
 
06:27:51.750 --> 06:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
example I use you know they pay $100 and
 
06:27:54.830 --> 06:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
Pharma has picked up the rest um and now
 
06:27:56.548 --> 06:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
they've automatically met their
 
06:27:59.310 --> 06:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
deductible um you know for the consumer
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
who's not on a drug that has a coupon or
 
06:28:04.190 --> 06:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
any sort of assistance they are are
 
06:28:06.948 --> 06:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
meeting their deductible you know in the
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
usual course of business yeah where
 
06:28:10.910 --> 06:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're just they don't have that
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
Advantage they didn't you know kind of
 
06:28:15.230 --> 06:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know win that lottery so to speak um
 
06:28:16.788 --> 06:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
and they're just paying their deductible
 
06:28:20.230 --> 06:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
as they go um yeah and then the other
 
06:28:23.788 --> 06:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
half is the pharmaceutical companies uh
 
06:28:24.590 --> 06:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know is this correct the
 
06:28:26.030 --> 06:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies could be
 
06:28:28.110 --> 06:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
disincentivized to play with their
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
pricing structure so that they can
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
maximize you they could take advantage
 
06:28:35.830 --> 06:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
of uh the insurance company having to uh
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
count the co- Paces that is our concern
 
06:28:44.030 --> 06:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay yes represent raor um
 
06:28:47.070 --> 06:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for your fortitude
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
and taking all our questions um the you
 
06:28:52.628 --> 06:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
read a sentence out of the bill but the
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
sentence after the one you read said
 
06:28:58.150 --> 06:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
that this requirement that coupons count
 
06:29:00.830 --> 06:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
towards deductibles shall not apply in
 
06:29:02.548 --> 06:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
the case of a prescription drug for
 
06:29:05.070 --> 06:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
which there is a generic alternative
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
and I think that was one of your
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that you know patients would be
 
06:29:13.948 --> 06:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
steered toward a higher price um drug
 
06:29:15.788 --> 06:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
when there is a generic available but it
 
06:29:17.708 --> 06:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
seems like this bill tries to address
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is that not sufficient so it's you
 
06:29:22.948 --> 06:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
you are correct it it does address a
 
06:29:24.750 --> 06:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
piece of it but there are other types of
 
06:29:27.510 --> 06:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
lower cost Alternatives besides generics
 
06:29:29.830 --> 06:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
there are also um biosimilars
 
06:29:32.110 --> 06:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic equivalents um and even
 
06:29:34.430 --> 06:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter medications that can be
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
taken in combination so we would want um
 
06:29:39.468 --> 06:29:39.478 align:start position:0%
any sort of lower cost alternative not
 
06:29:41.788 --> 06:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
just the category of generics okay so if
 
06:29:45.910 --> 06:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
we change that wording from generic to
 
06:29:47.830 --> 06:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
something more broad that would be
 
06:29:47.840 --> 06:29:50.830 align:start position:0%
something more broad that would be
sufficient

06:29:50.830 --> 06:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:53.590 --> 06:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes all right thank you thank
 
06:29:56.270 --> 06:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
you we have one more lobbyist come up
 
06:29:58.150 --> 06:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
you going to ask the other lobbyist the
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
question or do you think Heidi really
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
knows the answer better than the other
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.510 --> 06:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
a okay I knew
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that where I'm at right now I'm thinking
 
06:30:19.830 --> 06:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
that there can't be a lot of people who
 
06:30:22.310 --> 06:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
have these really expensive
 
06:30:27.070 --> 06:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
drugs okay I'm thinking there might
 
06:30:30.510 --> 06:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
be if we had a thousand New
 
06:30:33.670 --> 06:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe just a thousand of them
 
06:30:36.830 --> 06:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
one why don't we just mandate that the
 
06:30:40.030 --> 06:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
if they are taking any drug that is that
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
has no
 
06:30:46.030 --> 06:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
competitor that has no no competitor no
 
06:30:48.708 --> 06:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
alternative it's the only drug that they
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
can take and it's gone through your
 
06:30:55.190 --> 06:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
formulary and you tell the PBM that you
 
06:30:58.030 --> 06:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
know you beat that F that farmer down
 
06:31:00.150 --> 06:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
for the best possible price and we're
 
06:31:04.510 --> 06:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
going to wave the co-pay on that
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
particular drug because it's only a
 
06:31:09.468 --> 06:31:09.478 align:start position:0%
thousand you know with thousand and the
 
06:31:12.510 --> 06:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
worst you can have is you know wor this
 
06:31:13.868 --> 06:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
was could to cost us a couple hundred
 
06:31:15.468 --> 06:31:15.478 align:start position:0%
thousand in the state of Hampshire you
 
06:31:16.910 --> 06:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
know in terms of the rest of us paying
 
06:31:20.110 --> 06:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
the premium but then you the the
 
06:31:23.910 --> 06:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
pharmaceu the insurance companies P pbms
 
06:31:25.830 --> 06:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
beats down those companies for a cheap
 
06:31:29.350 --> 06:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
price say you can hold your assistance
 
06:31:31.150 --> 06:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want your assistance you know
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna we'll get that from New
 
06:31:35.590 --> 06:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens but we want you to
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
give us these overpriced drugs that you
 
06:31:40.628 --> 06:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
have no competitor with we want you to
 
06:31:42.190 --> 06:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
give us your best
 
06:31:44.388 --> 06:31:44.398 align:start position:0%
price what do you think of that idea
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
that sounds like
 
06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare so go ahead Sabrina okay um I I
 
06:31:53.230 --> 06:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question uh so I'm
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap I'm director of
 
06:31:57.628 --> 06:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
government relations for Anthem and uh
 
06:31:59.388 --> 06:31:59.398 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone hanging in there on
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
this what I think the testimony reflects
 
06:32:04.190 --> 06:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
is how complicated these issues are um
 
06:32:07.868 --> 06:32:07.878 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to S SP 354 um and I
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
think it's important there seems to be
 
06:32:12.670 --> 06:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
some sort of um confusion understandably
 
06:32:16.750 --> 06:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
between coupons and assistance programs
 
06:32:18.990 --> 06:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
and and my understanding is that they
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
are quite different including how
 
06:32:22.750 --> 06:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
carriers treat them I don't want to M
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
misspeak and so I will follow up on this
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
but my understanding I'm sure carriers
 
06:32:27.708 --> 06:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
treat them differently in different ways
 
06:32:30.190 --> 06:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
but for assistance when it's needs-based
 
06:32:33.628 --> 06:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
um the payments from the drug companies
 
06:32:35.230 --> 06:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
would would go towards deductible and
 
06:32:38.270 --> 06:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
out of- pocket max now if we're talking
 
06:32:42.070 --> 06:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
about the co-pay coupons where they're
 
06:32:44.910 --> 06:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
not needs based in in many cases centi
 
06:32:48.628 --> 06:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
pill 55s those are rebates so different
 
06:32:51.070 --> 06:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
so so that gets to an issue which is
 
06:32:52.830 --> 06:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
this bill the way it's drafted
 
06:32:55.468 --> 06:32:55.478 align:start position:0%
definitely applies to assistance and to
 
06:32:57.388 --> 06:32:57.398 align:start position:0%
co-pay coupons and that is what I'm
 
06:32:59.230 --> 06:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
focused on because that is what I'm most
 
06:33:01.590 --> 06:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
concerned with um but I think there is
 
06:33:04.310 --> 06:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
an important distinction there and and
 
06:33:05.868 --> 06:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
also just want to point out um
 
06:33:07.150 --> 06:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you're talking about
 
06:33:09.150 --> 06:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
narrowing the bill Etc but I don't want
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
to lose sight of the fact that it would
 
06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
any statutory change on this issue would
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
only impact fully insured members so I
 
06:33:16.910 --> 06:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the people who testified if
 
06:33:18.590 --> 06:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
they have a self-insured employer
 
06:33:21.190 --> 06:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored plan then this bill wouldn't
 
06:33:24.948 --> 06:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
apply anyway right um so I I do I've got
 
06:33:28.548 --> 06:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
a few points uh I do want to make and
 
06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully can clarify some issues and
 
06:33:33.430 --> 06:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions as well but
 
06:33:35.030 --> 06:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
I I do think this brings us back similar
 
06:33:36.910 --> 06:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
to 555 it brings us back to this
 
06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue of the high cost of
 
06:33:43.270 --> 06:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
drugs the reason copay coupon programs
 
06:33:46.430 --> 06:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
exist is because the drugs cost so much
 
06:33:48.750 --> 06:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
money so when I'm I'm talking now
 
06:33:50.230 --> 06:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
specifically about coupon program so
 
06:33:52.590 --> 06:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
non- needs-based um these are offered
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
only to specific patients for specific
 
06:33:57.070 --> 06:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
drugs for a short amount of time now
 
06:33:59.110 --> 06:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
once the patient hits the deductible and
 
06:34:00.628 --> 06:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
they don't see the actual cost of the
 
06:34:02.590 --> 06:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
drug that's when the drug makers stop
 
06:34:03.910 --> 06:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
providing the coupon and they think this
 
06:34:06.190 --> 06:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
gets at your question chairman hunt you
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
asked earlier why don't Pharmaceuticals
 
06:34:09.230 --> 06:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
allow the coupons to go on for as long
 
06:34:11.110 --> 06:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
as the patient needs them I think it's a
 
06:34:14.468 --> 06:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
good question I I think that um the way
 
06:34:16.510 --> 06:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's set up now where patient hits
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
deductible copay coupon program Ends by
 
06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the rules of the drug company that
 
06:34:23.750 --> 06:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
allows the drug companies to keep their
 
06:34:25.868 --> 06:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
costs very high that means members pick
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
up those costs and employers pick up
 
06:34:30.030 --> 06:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
those costs and to be clear the co-pay
 
06:34:31.708 --> 06:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
coupon programs do not actually lower
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
the costs of the drugs the High Cost of
 
06:34:36.190 --> 06:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
the drugs remain even with the programs
 
06:34:37.708 --> 06:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
these programs simply create the
 
06:34:39.948 --> 06:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
illusion of
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
affordability I also uh representative
 
06:34:43.510 --> 06:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
spear mentioned this I do think it's a
 
06:34:45.150 --> 06:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
really important point that copay
 
06:34:46.628 --> 06:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
coupons I don't know about other
 
06:34:48.270 --> 06:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs they are considered
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
illegal Kickbacks by the federal
 
06:34:51.230 --> 06:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
government they are not allowed under
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
medicated Medicare and I think this gets
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
at sort of the mechanics and the flow at
 
06:34:58.110 --> 06:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
least with c-a coupons the value of the
 
06:35:00.270 --> 06:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
coupon goes from the manufacturer who
 
06:35:02.868 --> 06:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
issues the coupon to the pharmacy as a
 
06:35:04.990 --> 06:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
form of consumer payment applied toward
 
06:35:06.868 --> 06:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
the cost of the manufacturer's drug and
 
06:35:09.430 --> 06:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
then back to the manufacturer as payment
 
06:35:11.948 --> 06:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
for the drug at no point do carriers or
 
06:35:14.788 --> 06:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
pbms receive the value of that coupon so
 
06:35:16.628 --> 06:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
getting at this issue of like double
 
06:35:18.990 --> 06:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
dipping I I think that that's actually
 
06:35:20.830 --> 06:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
truly a misund understanding of how the
 
06:35:23.310 --> 06:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
process works um I won't go into the
 
06:35:24.788 --> 06:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
studies about how this raises cost for
 
06:35:27.788 --> 06:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
everyone but those certainly exist okay
 
06:35:31.628 --> 06:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
so bringing us to the the concerns I
 
06:35:33.708 --> 06:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
have with the way this build function I
 
06:35:35.310 --> 06:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
think the language of the bill is is
 
06:35:36.990 --> 06:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
confusing it's not like you read it and
 
06:35:39.708 --> 06:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
it says this will ban X Y and Z but
 
06:35:41.388 --> 06:35:41.398 align:start position:0%
having dealt with language like this in
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
other states we are aware that the point
 
06:35:47.310 --> 06:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
of bills like this and functionally is
 
06:35:50.548 --> 06:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
to stop programs similar to ones that
 
06:35:52.510 --> 06:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
Anthem has and other carriers have
 
06:35:55.350 --> 06:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
created um sort of in the face of these
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
coupon programs and I think you know
 
06:36:00.030 --> 06:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of public policy
 
06:36:02.110 --> 06:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
concerns I have around the existence of
 
06:36:03.830 --> 06:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
these programs but if they are going to
 
06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
exist and I believe Massachusetts did
 
06:36:08.548 --> 06:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
actually ban some of them um and they're
 
06:36:10.030 --> 06:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to be heavily marketed to people
 
06:36:12.190 --> 06:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
on these medications carriers should be
 
06:36:14.030 --> 06:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to find ways to most efficiently
 
06:36:15.990 --> 06:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
provide these high-cost specialty drugs
 
06:36:18.548 --> 06:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
to our members and S SP 354 would
 
06:36:21.670 --> 06:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
interfere with some of these programs um
 
06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to talk about this more
 
06:36:24.270 --> 06:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
offline I don't want to get too bogged
 
06:36:28.868 --> 06:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
in the details but the the issue is that
 
06:36:31.070 --> 06:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
under our program which helps our
 
06:36:32.830 --> 06:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
members afford these high-cost specialty
 
06:36:36.030 --> 06:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
drugs which is what we want um and our
 
06:36:37.230 --> 06:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
goal here is
 
06:36:40.910 --> 06:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
coverage part of our program is that the
 
06:36:45.670 --> 06:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
um the co-pay coupon amount does not go
 
06:36:46.910 --> 06:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the patients
 
06:36:49.230 --> 06:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
deductible and the drug companies don't
 
06:36:51.070 --> 06:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
like that for the reasons I mentioned
 
06:36:54.190 --> 06:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
earlier but our program saves employers
 
06:36:56.510 --> 06:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of money it's incredibly popular
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
with our self-insured employer groups
 
06:37:00.510 --> 06:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
and it's very popular popular among our
 
06:37:02.150 --> 06:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
members including in the fully insured
 
06:37:03.910 --> 06:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
Market because under our program they
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
pay 0 for the specialty drug and I
 
06:37:09.830 --> 06:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe the way we are reading this bill
 
06:37:11.468 --> 06:37:11.478 align:start position:0%
is that that program would no longer be
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to exist under if this bill were
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
to pass as is
 
06:37:18.910 --> 06:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
um I also just want to quickly address
 
06:37:20.310 --> 06:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
this idea of
 
06:37:22.708 --> 06:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
contributing contributing to someone's
 
06:37:25.468 --> 06:37:25.478 align:start position:0%
deductible or out- of pocket max so my
 
06:37:28.388 --> 06:37:28.398 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if you're so if
 
06:37:29.990 --> 06:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
you have a deductible the whole point is
 
06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
that certain medical costs to the
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
patient go to the deductible usually now
 
06:37:36.990 --> 06:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's so many different plan designs
 
06:37:38.350 --> 06:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
but I think typically you hit your
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
deductible then you also have a portion
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
of co- insurance so it means you're
 
06:37:44.708 --> 06:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
paying some and the insurance company's
 
06:37:46.110 --> 06:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
paying some that goes to your out-of
 
06:37:48.190 --> 06:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
pocket max usually well when you hit
 
06:37:49.310 --> 06:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
your out-of- pocket max things are
 
06:37:52.270 --> 06:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
covered at 100% And so I just I think
 
06:37:53.910 --> 06:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's a red hairing and a
 
06:37:55.750 --> 06:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this idea that people
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
would be like trying to contribute to
 
06:37:58.868 --> 06:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
your deductible and an insurance company
 
06:38:00.110 --> 06:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
would be saying you can't do that it's
 
06:38:03.150 --> 06:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
just it's simply not how Insurance works
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
so payments for medical services will go
 
06:38:08.510 --> 06:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
to the deductible so if somebody wanted
 
06:38:10.110 --> 06:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
to help you out they would say oh you
 
06:38:11.270 --> 06:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
have a high medical bill from your
 
06:38:13.270 --> 06:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
provider let me give you money for that
 
06:38:14.830 --> 06:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
and they could certainly pay that bill
 
06:38:16.990 --> 06:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
and under depending on your plan design
 
06:38:18.150 --> 06:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
that payment would go towards your
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
deductible so that's how it works so I I
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
think it it's really sort of nonsensical
 
06:38:24.510 --> 06:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
to suggest that there's some like
 
06:38:26.350 --> 06:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
deductible pot sitting there waiting to
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
be filled and somehow wor saying no you
 
06:38:29.868 --> 06:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
can't do that so I just wanted to
 
06:38:33.990 --> 06:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that um and I I just I Echo what
 
06:38:35.388 --> 06:38:35.398 align:start position:0%
Heidi said I think we'd support
 
06:38:37.070 --> 06:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendments that would bring in consumer
 
06:38:40.030 --> 06:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
protections I want to just I want to
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
just I'll end by saying this I really
 
06:38:44.590 --> 06:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the patient comments and I
 
06:38:46.230 --> 06:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
will just note I have a kid with a rare
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
disease and live and breathe in the
 
06:38:49.628 --> 06:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
world of high- cost specialty drugs the
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
world of Rheumatology and so I really
 
06:38:54.910 --> 06:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate their comments and um
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
certainly like personally and
 
06:38:57.868 --> 06:38:57.878 align:start position:0%
professionally we want people to have
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
access to these drugs I don't think this
 
06:39:01.468 --> 06:39:01.478 align:start position:0%
bill helps it does not help lower the
 
06:39:03.070 --> 06:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
cost of these drugs I don't think it
 
06:39:05.468 --> 06:39:05.478 align:start position:0%
helps improve access and I think it's
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
really important to think about consumer
 
06:39:08.990 --> 06:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
protections I was actually poking around
 
06:39:10.628 --> 06:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
a drug company's website today looking
 
06:39:12.310 --> 06:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
at their copay coupon program and how
 
06:39:13.948 --> 06:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
you sign up I've actually experienced it
 
06:39:18.868 --> 06:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
myself um and in the language uh it says
 
06:39:20.590 --> 06:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
this cop assistance program is subject
 
06:39:22.628 --> 06:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
to change reduction in monetary amount
 
06:39:25.388 --> 06:39:25.398 align:start position:0%
or discontinuation without any notice so
 
06:39:27.430 --> 06:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to think about
 
06:39:29.230 --> 06:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
are these programs you know something
 
06:39:31.070 --> 06:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we should be promoting in the first
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
place I don't think we should and I
 
06:39:34.030 --> 06:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
think at the very very least we should
 
06:39:35.910 --> 06:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
be promoting more transparency from the
 
06:39:37.510 --> 06:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
drug companies about how these programs
 
06:39:41.350 --> 06:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
work and also really put in more um
 
06:39:42.910 --> 06:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
consumer protections if we're going to
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
move forward with the bill so um anyway
 
06:39:47.310 --> 06:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
I will end there and I'm happy to try to
 
06:39:49.150 --> 06:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
answer any remaining questions and thank
 
06:39:52.070 --> 06:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
you for your time okay retive MCU you
 
06:39:53.388 --> 06:39:53.398 align:start position:0%
still have your
 
06:39:56.350 --> 06:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
question does Anthem use any stop loss
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
coverage for high loss claims High loss
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
patients such as all the folks behind
 
06:40:05.270 --> 06:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
you and your own stop I I would have to
 
06:40:06.948 --> 06:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
get back to you I don't know I don't
 
06:40:08.708 --> 06:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that off the top of
 
06:40:08.718 --> 06:40:10.590 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that off the top of
my

06:40:10.590 --> 06:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
head okay representative post did you
 
06:40:16.670 --> 06:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
have a question yes thank you very much
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna go back to the same
 
06:40:21.628 --> 06:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
question I had before the woman who said
 
06:40:24.788 --> 06:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
she um made a payment and it wouldn't go
 
06:40:27.310 --> 06:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
towards the deductible but what you're
 
06:40:30.590 --> 06:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
saying is that money actually goes to
 
06:40:32.670 --> 06:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
like if they've they're done with their
 
06:40:36.110 --> 06:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
deductible it goes to like a co-pay is
 
06:40:38.388 --> 06:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
that what you were saying so no that
 
06:40:39.548 --> 06:40:39.558 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the question that's
 
06:40:40.750 --> 06:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
not what I was trying to say and I'm
 
06:40:42.190 --> 06:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
trying to remember exactly what was said
 
06:40:44.830 --> 06:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
but I think so and I I think this does
 
06:40:47.708 --> 06:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
get confusing so co-pays typically are
 
06:40:49.468 --> 06:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
for are sort of set under your plan so
 
06:40:51.788 --> 06:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
if you go to a PCP you have a $20 copay
 
06:40:53.868 --> 06:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
it's sort of always that um depending on
 
06:40:55.868 --> 06:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
your plan design that $20 may or may not
 
06:40:57.868 --> 06:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
go towards your deductible so you have
 
06:40:59.388 --> 06:40:59.398 align:start position:0%
to hit your deductible let's say it's
 
06:41:01.670 --> 06:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
$1,000 once you hit your deductible
 
06:41:03.868 --> 06:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
again depending on the plan design
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
then you may have a co- inssurance that
 
06:41:08.590 --> 06:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
kicks in where the insurance company
 
06:41:11.750 --> 06:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
pays 80% of the cost and you pay 20%
 
06:41:13.990 --> 06:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
once you hit so let's say there's
 
06:41:15.548 --> 06:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
another let's say you have a $5,000
 
06:41:18.030 --> 06:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
out-of pocket max and a $3,000
 
06:41:19.990 --> 06:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
deductible you hit your $3,000
 
06:41:21.990 --> 06:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
deductible then the co- Insurance kicks
 
06:41:24.590 --> 06:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
in you still are paying you know your
 
06:41:26.548 --> 06:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
20% and with it when it's a high cost
 
06:41:28.990 --> 06:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
drug it depends on the situation but you
 
06:41:30.708 --> 06:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
could hit that out of pocket max very
 
06:41:34.510 --> 06:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
quickly um so I don't know what the
 
06:41:36.670 --> 06:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
example was in terms of of saying that
 
06:41:38.150 --> 06:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
somebody tried to pay someone's co-pay
 
06:41:40.070 --> 06:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
because a co-pay is usually like you
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
know when you go for the service to your
 
06:41:42.990 --> 06:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
doctor's office they'd say you owe your
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
$20 copay anyone could pay that no I
 
06:41:48.628 --> 06:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
actually this I'm thinking more of not
 
06:41:51.510 --> 06:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
so much the co-pay I'm thinking about
 
06:41:55.350 --> 06:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
the deductible that where um if let's
 
06:41:58.628 --> 06:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
take the real numbers you have an
 
06:42:02.388 --> 06:42:02.398 align:start position:0%
$8,000 deductible that means the first
 
06:42:02.398 --> 06:42:04.070 align:start position:0%
$8,000 deductible that means the first
$8,000

06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
$8,000
 
06:42:06.548 --> 06:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
that are paid out in any your bills
 
06:42:09.150 --> 06:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
you've got to pay that and that it's not
 
06:42:11.110 --> 06:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
until you got
 
06:42:13.548 --> 06:42:13.558 align:start position:0%
there that now the insurance company
 
06:42:18.310 --> 06:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
covers it so that if somebody has this
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
assistance they're assuming that that
 
06:42:24.430 --> 06:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
assistance is being paid to that co-
 
06:42:26.750 --> 06:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
that co-pay so if they're getting that
 
06:42:30.548 --> 06:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
that $2,000 or whatever big large number
 
06:42:31.590 --> 06:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
and they're thinking they're putting
 
06:42:34.230 --> 06:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
that to that assistance what I heard you
 
06:42:37.708 --> 06:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
say is no that $2,000 is actually used
 
06:42:41.430 --> 06:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
to drop the price of what the the
 
06:42:43.910 --> 06:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
medicine was so the only person who
 
06:42:45.788 --> 06:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
really benefits from that is obviously
 
06:42:48.750 --> 06:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
the payes of the premium I the employer
 
06:42:50.628 --> 06:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
or they because they're they're kicking
 
06:42:52.750 --> 06:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
in but that's where it's coming coming
 
06:42:56.070 --> 06:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming off that that payment and
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're thinking that that it's supposed
 
06:43:01.150 --> 06:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
to help them reduce their deductible so
 
06:43:04.590 --> 06:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
they get to that $8,000 f faster but
 
06:43:07.430 --> 06:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's not being used for that that's what
 
06:43:09.590 --> 06:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think I'm hearing yes I I think I
 
06:43:12.468 --> 06:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying um and I
 
06:43:15.310 --> 06:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
think my response and and I understand
 
06:43:17.310 --> 06:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
that having lived through these issues
 
06:43:19.628 --> 06:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
myself I think we would say that you
 
06:43:22.948 --> 06:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
know sort of generally a lot a lot of
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
factors go into setting rates we have to
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
set them far in advance they have to be
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
approved by the insurance department
 
06:43:29.310 --> 06:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
every year when I talked to my team
 
06:43:30.910 --> 06:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
about these issues they were saying
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
there all these things fit together
 
06:43:33.948 --> 06:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
deductibles premium co-pays co-
 
06:43:36.070 --> 06:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
Insurance everything fits together and
 
06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
things like um co-pay coupons sort of
 
06:43:42.270 --> 06:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
disrupt the way we have created the plan
 
06:43:46.110 --> 06:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
and the benefit design and so um I think
 
06:43:48.030 --> 06:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
also we have we have you know because we
 
06:43:49.230 --> 06:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the existence of these
 
06:43:51.388 --> 06:43:51.398 align:start position:0%
co-pa coupon programs we have designed
 
06:43:54.990 --> 06:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
programs that more efficiently use that
 
06:43:57.110 --> 06:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
assistance so the our members are paying
 
06:43:59.310 --> 06:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
Z doar for the drugs and it's true that
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
that copay assistance isn't going
 
06:44:02.708 --> 06:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
towards the deductible but I think that
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know we can that's the debate is we
 
06:44:06.510 --> 06:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
think that's how our plans should
 
06:44:08.190 --> 06:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
function because it should be the
 
06:44:10.830 --> 06:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
patients cost going to the deductible so
 
06:44:12.510 --> 06:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
see no more questions I'm going we have
 
06:44:15.388 --> 06:44:15.398 align:start position:0%
to give you out of here by five um I'm
 
06:44:17.708 --> 06:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
going to look at you and know Peter
 
06:44:21.788 --> 06:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
bragon here but I'm at hi so I what and
 
06:44:23.590 --> 06:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay you want to get in on this Curtis
 
06:44:26.628 --> 06:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
okay so here's what I I think I would
 
06:44:29.310 --> 06:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
rather see us do is that take what the
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
today about class five drugs and I don't
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
know how many drugs are how many
 
06:44:39.990 --> 06:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals are in this
 
06:44:42.350 --> 06:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
category but that their assumption is
 
06:44:45.468 --> 06:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
that they're one of a kinds one is and
 
06:44:45.478 --> 06:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
that they're one of a kinds one is and
very

06:44:47.190 --> 06:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
unique and uh I can't imagine that other
 
06:44:53.628 --> 06:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
states having looked at this to try to
 
06:44:56.750 --> 06:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
narrow this issue down to just that
 
06:45:00.628 --> 06:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
problem is how do we handle these very
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
unique specialized because we keep
 
06:45:04.868 --> 06:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
saying if there was another drug if
 
06:45:07.350 --> 06:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
there you know is another choice I think
 
06:45:10.388 --> 06:45:10.398 align:start position:0%
of you know yes it is true that we have
 
06:45:13.548 --> 06:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
um you know the insurance companies have
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
a a system where you call in and they'll
 
06:45:17.590 --> 06:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know and they're going to tell you
 
06:45:19.230 --> 06:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
well why don't you try this other drug
 
06:45:21.230 --> 06:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
there you know there you know there I
 
06:45:23.230 --> 06:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
guess it's the PBM that does that know
 
06:45:25.230 --> 06:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
who does does when you when you when
 
06:45:26.830 --> 06:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
your doctor's giving you this
 
06:45:29.310 --> 06:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
prescription then you're going to get I
 
06:45:34.190 --> 06:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
guess it's the uh pre pre approval maybe
 
06:45:35.628 --> 06:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
maybe that has to be in that other bill
 
06:45:38.150 --> 06:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
that we have but so that's some system
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
where is that those unique drugs and
 
06:45:45.910 --> 06:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
that we want to um obviously the intent
 
06:45:49.590 --> 06:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
was that because the dollar amounts the
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
co to their deductible are so
 
06:45:58.388 --> 06:45:58.398 align:start position:0%
high that that's why there is this
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
incentive by the intern the
 
06:46:02.590 --> 06:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company to give a benefit
 
06:46:04.230 --> 06:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
to give they say oh we're going to help
 
06:46:07.590 --> 06:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
pay for that when it's not even sure
 
06:46:09.070 --> 06:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
whether that's what's really happening
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
with assistance but now we have these
 
06:46:13.468 --> 06:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
two different things so I want to just
 
06:46:16.430 --> 06:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
narrow this down to what we heard in
 
06:46:16.440 --> 06:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
narrow this down to what we heard in
today's

06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
today's
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
testimony okay and that because the
 
06:46:22.230 --> 06:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
assumption would always be if there is
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
other choices if there's other ways to
 
06:46:27.708 --> 06:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
solve it then you know the insurance
 
06:46:29.230 --> 06:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
company will certainly have an
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tell the patient by the
 
06:46:32.948 --> 06:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
way there's something else you should do
 
06:46:38.070 --> 06:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
do and not be enticed by some carrot
 
06:46:39.548 --> 06:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it is dangling
 
06:46:41.468 --> 06:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
in front of them and say if you take
 
06:46:43.788 --> 06:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
this expensive drug you'll get this but
 
06:46:46.430 --> 06:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
if that expensive drug has a competitor
 
06:46:48.548 --> 06:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
no we don't that's what we're trying to
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
avoid you know we want you you know to
 
06:46:53.868 --> 06:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
do what you guys do best which is to get
 
06:46:56.628 --> 06:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
them to think of another choice but if
 
06:46:58.430 --> 06:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
there is no other
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
choice and we're talking about a
 
06:47:04.310 --> 06:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
$300,000 medication
 
06:47:07.548 --> 06:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
okay that's class five this unique thing
 
06:47:09.430 --> 06:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm like I say I'm assuming that
 
06:47:12.110 --> 06:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
they're not there's not more than a
 
06:47:14.468 --> 06:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
thousand people in New Hampshire who are
 
06:47:15.548 --> 06:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
in this
 
06:47:18.430 --> 06:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
situation that that you know we will
 
06:47:21.070 --> 06:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
let's figure out how to solve it for
 
06:47:24.788 --> 06:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
them differently than everyone else who
 
06:47:26.590 --> 06:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
really does have a choice about what the
 
06:47:28.910 --> 06:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
medicine they're taking does everybody
 
06:47:31.830 --> 06:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:34.990 --> 06:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
that perfect I will close the public
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
hearing and we'll see you all next week
 
06:47:40.230 --> 06:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
we'll do Tuesday Morning Tuesday morning
 
06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
we'll do health insurance oh that's
 
06:47:45.030 --> 06:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
right I got another day with this fun
 
06:47:47.948 --> 06:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
stuff okay and is it 10 or nine some
 
06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
reason I have it I think we're nine
 
06:47:51.750 --> 06:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
because I was trying to get everything
 
06:47:53.190 --> 06:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the morning so we wouldn't have to be
 
06:47:55.150 --> 06:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
06:47:58.230 --> 06:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm sure you enjoy that
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
because you have to be here Thursday and
 
06:48:01.350 --> 06:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to drive
 
06:48:03.788 --> 06:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
home no not
 
06:48:05.628 --> 06:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I'm say that's what you want
 
06:48:05.638 --> 06:48:31.708 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I'm say that's what you want
to

06:48:31.708 --> 06:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
