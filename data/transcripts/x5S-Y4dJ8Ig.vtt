00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:03.919 align:start position:0%
a from single-use plastics to um to
 
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
refillable mul you know refillable
 
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles
 
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
i think has been has been good for the
 
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
environment and and also encourages
 
00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
students and
 
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
anybody that's uh carrying around a
 
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
refillable water bottle to uh to remain
 
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
hydrated during the day and that is uh
 
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
that is as the doctor as dr sherman
 
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out good for uh for people's
 
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
health overall
 
00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
one of the additional things we did in
 
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
in hopkinton to make sure that all
 
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
students had access was uh was
 
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with rolling out the
 
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
hydration stations uh we did a campaign
 
00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to provide all of our students
 
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
with uh with um with hopkinton water
 
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
bottles and i have one one of them with
 
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
me today this was back in the
 
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
2013-2014 school year so it was probably
 
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
i got this from my son's room so uh so i
 
00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
did empty it out and i'm sure that this
 
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
is full of clean uh filtered
 
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh water so uh so if there are any
 
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions um i'd be happy to to take
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
them uh and um and thank you very much
 
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
for for um uh hopefully some getting
 
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
your support for this bill thanks thank
 
00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
you very much representative luna are
 
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
 
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.469 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
porter

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
porter
 
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative this is just my ignorance
 
00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
at the water bottle filling stations is
 
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
it possible to get a drink of water if
 
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have a bottle to fill
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a great question and
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
and i actually asked um um
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
rebecca wilson that that question she
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
was she was with the hopkins school
 
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
district at the time and i was trying to
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
remember that um i think there are some
 
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
models that uh that that do both um a a
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
bubbler as well as a as a filling
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
station i think in hopkinton we did not
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
replace bubblers with with filling
 
00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
stations we put the filling stations
 
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
either near or uh
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
or in an area in areas where where um
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
where clearly there would be demand for
 
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh for for hydration stations so so we
 
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
we supplemented the avail the
 
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
availability of bubbler water with with
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
hydration stations
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative cornell
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is thank you for
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's more of a
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
comment after 36 years in a middle
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
school i agree that bubblers are really
 
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.949 align:start position:0%
school i agree that bubblers are really
gross

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 align:start position:0%
gross
 
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
and and i think this is a wonderful idea
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for that question
 
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
because i feel exactly the the same way
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
about the the bubbler down at the top of
 
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
the hallway here and uh and um the chair
 
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
had uh had had advised me rather than
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
filling um my water bottle there uh to
 
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
go into the um the the back side of the
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh the finance uh room where they
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
filtered water uh system in there so
 
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm glad glad you
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
took my advice i did
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i i do have a question for you in the
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill it talks about um
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have new construction
 
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
or a substantial renovation and i know
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
within the school building aid program
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
we have a definition of what renovation
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
is it's a certain percentage of the to
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
replace the whole thing right um
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
is there is that the definition that
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be using in this bill uh
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
to define what is a substantial
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
innovation is it just re replacing the
 
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
boiler system or the heating system
 
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it would probably have to
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
be beyond that but it would be subject
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
to rule making under uh 541a as as as as
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
spelled out on line four
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
on uh section one of the bill so the
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
department would would be doing rule
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
making on that and i would i would
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
imagine they'd probably replicate the um
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
the definition from the um the approved
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh building projects um definition of
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
substantial but but this does also
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
extend to approved building projects too
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
under um under 198.
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
is it 198.15 and uh
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
so any project that's going to be uh be
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
applying for um for uh building aid
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
would also have to incorporate um
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
hydration stations into the body i
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
noticed that uh senator sherman just
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
walked in the room um
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
i've stolen his son sherman
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up and sit beside
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
representative he's introducing your
 
00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.909 align:start position:0%
representative he's introducing your
bill

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for the record tom
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
sherman district 24 senate uh 11 towns
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast and i'm sure he did a
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
spectacular job
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh i just came over from i i had two
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
bills at nine o'clock so i apologize uh
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
not being able to be
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
two places at once uh
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
i only if you have questions i don't
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
well i do have one for you and i have
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
one for
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
for dave but uh
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
brought this forward did you look to get
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
a fiscal analysis and what kind of costs
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
are we looking at in terms of
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
putting this uh program into effect in
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question there is a
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and of course it's
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable so i i saw
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
the goal of this though as as you know
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
we always try to avoid
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
anything that tells municipalities
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
what to do what not to do um
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
that will result
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
in a significant increase in cost to
 
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.710 align:start position:0%
in a significant increase in cost to
them

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
so the goal here was exactly that and
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we limited it to
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
new construction and substantial
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
construction i think the heart
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
association will be able to talk about
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
the relative cost but
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
the cost savings are that you don't need
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
as many of these systems as you need
 
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
as many of these systems as you need
bubblers

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
bubblers
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then long-term of course the cost
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
savings are in health because these are
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
filtering devices and
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
that means that the water we do have
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
problems with contaminants in our water
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
systems and
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
in the schools and this filters those
 
00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
in the schools and this filters those
out

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know you can filter out arsenic and
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
lead with a filter pitcher so it's not
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
like some of the more
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh difficult to filter out contaminants
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
these are relatively easy and in the
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
developing child
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
lead and arsenic are two of them biggest
 
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.629 align:start position:0%
lead and arsenic are two of them biggest
neurotoxins

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
neurotoxins
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
around that's why we're so worried about
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
them so
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a win-win it's it's if it's
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
done appropriately it's not going to be
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
a significant cost increase over
 
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.870 align:start position:0%
a significant cost increase over
bubblers

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
bubblers
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
and then long-term to the state to the
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
families to the children it's a huge
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
cost saver because the
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen from other places
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
the the impact and cost of
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
having high lead levels or elevated lead
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
levels and asbestos is just in new
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's we're the granite state
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
so we're the asbestos state so it's it's
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's something that's there and
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
that will all be filtered out which is
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
being on the drinking water groundwater
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund commission with senator morse
 
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
trust fund commission with senator morse
um

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is a huge passion of mine is to
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
make sure the water is clean yes i i and
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
we did pass the lead uh bill here great
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is great and so with that are
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
there further questions from the
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator and
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative for both being here um
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
i i guess that um this would require
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
a new policy to be developed
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
by the local school board you know
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and over on to page
 
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and over on to page
two

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that that policy may include a
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering um with
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
roman 4 c on the
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
topic page 2
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
have you heard of or experienced
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
possibly um any instances where uh the
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
water bottles were not exclusively
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
filled with water
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
great question and of course that you
 
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.350 align:start position:0%
great question and of course that you
know

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
there's already disciplinary issues with
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
bubblers you you know the frequent flyer
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
that child who
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
is always having to go get a drink of
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
water um
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
and so in a way this will
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to that our kids are
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
completely used to this at our ski areas
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
most of them have these water bottle
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
filling stations
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't think they're putting
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
substances in those per se
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
need to be borne out over time but what
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
the bill does and and this was thanks to
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey she put
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
some of this in there to give
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
the schools the ability to regulate
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
where bottles could go
 
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.750 align:start position:0%
where bottles could go
and

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so i really appreciate she made the
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill much better by
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
putting in that ability for the schools
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
lakers

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
lakers
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm picturing the
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
how this all works
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
and so i'm wondering in um
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
when it's talking about
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know extensive
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
what do they say uh substantial
 
00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.509 align:start position:0%
what do they say uh substantial
renovations

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering a school that's putting on
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
an addition
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty substantial renovation
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
but it has nothing to do with the major
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
body of the school
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so would
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
that apply to them
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of that question
 
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of that question
is

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
are these pretty easy to hook up to like
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
already a water fountain right where
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's plumbing run to it is this
 
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
there's plumbing run to it is this
something

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's pretty easy i'm just thinking of
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
all our old schools
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
and how difficult plumbing is and is
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
this going to be something that's pretty
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
easy to then
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
tap off of that plumbing that's there to
 
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
tap off of that plumbing that's there to
install

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
install
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
i'm just a gastroenterologist so i deal
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
with human plumbing and not that type of
 
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
with human plumbing and not that type of
plumbing

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
the retrofit you already see that
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
happening all over the place they're
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
retrofitting in in ski areas like cannon
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
mountain and others
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
where the plumbing is
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
older than me and um
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't think a retrofit is a big
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
issue okay but but what you do bring up
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
is there is already a requirement for
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
access to water drinking water in new
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
large editions
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
and this actually requires less of these
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
facilities than bubblers
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
so and i think the heart association
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to that
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the efficiencies that
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
from doing this is that you
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
you don't need as many um as you do the
 
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
you don't need as many um as you do the
others

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
further reps and hops and i saw you have
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
your hand up you have a follow-up well i
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
did have a follow-up sorry that's to
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh uh
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
senator sherman i was just wondering
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of filter do they use is this
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
a carbon filter does it need to be
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
replaced i don't see any information
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
right there there is a line in here they
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
they typically are carbon filters you
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
know resin filters are the ones that you
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
would use for pfas and that gets into
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
a whole different level that's just not
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's not really
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable in this setting
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
but the carbon filters will get most of
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
what i think it's line 14 on the first
 
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.350 align:start position:0%
what i think it's line 14 on the first
page

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
water bottle filling stations installed
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
in public schools under this section
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
shall be regularly cleaned
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then section 2 be maintained to
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
ensure they function properly including
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
replacing filters
 
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
replacing filters
and

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know the carbon filters aren't
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
really a big deal disposal they go into
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
lined landfills because they do carry
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
all those lovely contaminants that we're
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
keeping out of our children's
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
gi tracts but um
 
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
gi tracts but um
but

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
they're you know many of us have i have
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
carbon filter at home so you know many
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
of us have those
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
i see uh senator ward in here you didn't
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
feel it are you wanting to talk are you
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
just accompanying the other senator to
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the room we don't go anywhere without
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
oh you're here for the next one okay
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
great any further questions
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
a quick one because i know the senators
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
have to get out i know just real quick
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything to deal with bathroom
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
breaks because i know numerous students
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
decide not to drink because they don't
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
have time to go to the bathroom
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and if we are encouraging drinking which
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
we should it's unhealthy not to drink
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
and not to go to the bathroom
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
are we addressing that in any way
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
not really although you know good
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
hydration means you have to go to the
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom so as we all know um but
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
you know that would be up to the teacher
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the child and working out those
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.710 align:start position:0%
and the child and working out those
relationships

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
what it would mean is less drinking
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
water i mean drinking fountain breaks
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
because they would have their own supply
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much senator
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and representative luno appreciate it
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
okay uh nancy vaughn from the american
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
heart association
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
for information for the committee here
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
we also have diana fenton here from the
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
department for technical questions if we
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
good morning um for the record um i am
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
nancy vaughn director of government
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
relations for the american heart
 
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.069 align:start position:0%
relations for the american heart
association

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
i really don't i have um comments but
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
they've all been covered already um so i
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
think what i will mainly say is you know
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
this is a a priority of the american
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
heart association is to ensure children
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
are properly hydrated
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
interests and
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
properly hydrated children are also
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
better prepared for learning
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
and all of this is is covered within my
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony as well
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
so this is an appropriate place for this
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
policy to to reside
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
and we strongly encourage you to pass
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
this on but if you do have any questions
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm very happy to take those on
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
just one of the questions that was
 
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.150 align:start position:0%
just one of the questions that was
mentioned

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
with the american heart association
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps providing the answer
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we looked to writing this bill
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
did look at what the current language is
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
within department of education for
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
construction and substantial renovation
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
was the term that they use and there is
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
i believe a financial
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
threshold that that begins that but
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
these are definitely devices that can be
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
added to current plumbing
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
for the renovation type areas there are
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
so many different models a water bottle
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
filling station some can be incorporated
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
in existing water fountains some of them
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
come with their own water fountains as
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
well as the filling station but
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah so any other questions that you
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
have because both the center and the
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative did a great job
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill thank you very
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
much nancy are there any questions for
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
the heart association
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
now cnn thank you very much thank you
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh just quickly are there any questions
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
from the department technical support
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
here yes representative tanner
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh colonel are you willing to come on up
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
good morning i hate to
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
pass a time
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know when i could ask you a question
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
i would miss that as well
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
my question is about the fiscal note on
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
the back of the of the of this bill
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that um although it's indeterminable i
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
would assume from lba
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
this is from the department of education
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
who said that these
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh water filling stations approximately
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh and regular drinking fountains range
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
between four and five hundred dollars um
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if that's just a
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
guesstimate or whether there was actual
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
research done on that
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question for the
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
record my name is dianna fenton i'm an
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
education and all this discussion about
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
water and water bottle filling stations
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
i felt very guilty drinking my diet
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
pepsi in the back of the room so i need
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
to self self assess here um
 
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.430 align:start position:0%
to self self assess here um
so

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
as your question this fiscal note was
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
done i believe by amy clark uh who this
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee is well aware of um
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
i can't speak directly for her but my
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
experience with amy clark is she does
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
not guesstimate
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
she is an engineer she's very precise
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i have no doubt that she looked up
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
the average cost of this i know that i
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
approve this fiscal note as is our
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
process but i did not oversee and
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
micromanage amy's work but i would uh
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
feel confident telling you that these
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
are pretty accurate prices yeah it just
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
seems a little high um maybe it's
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
new rather than retrofitting but i would
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
blame it on the supply chain issues okay
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
everything's gone up
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the department just has one minor uh
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
point to address to this committee as it
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
pertains to senate bill 233 and that is
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
the concern of um this does contain
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking pursuant to 541a and the
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
effective date says this act shall take
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
the department would ask this committee
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee to recognize that rulemaking
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
simply takes time we would ask for 90
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
days or maybe even 180 days recognizing
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
that there are significant number of
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills coming out that require rulemaking
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
and so we have to be cognizant of our
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
ability to enter into that rulemaking
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
process within that required time frame
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be the department's um
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
i have one further request from you um
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
when you get back and talk with amy
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
clarke i'm curious to know when we wrote
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
the school building aid
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
language in statute
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we put down a definition for what a
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
renovation project is a substantial
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
renovation as a certain percentage of
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
replacing the building as new
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
i'd like to find out from her
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
if this is the proper language a
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation i don't want to
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
get confused with what we have in school
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
building aid that could be a sizeable
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
hunk of money that you have to do rather
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
than just replacing for example your
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
electrical systems or your hvac sure i
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
will have amy contact you and you can
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a further discussion on that that's
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
a very valid point thank you thank you
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department yes
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you here's my question do you
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
really need rule making or should we
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
i mean it seems sort of general i'm not
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
sure that there's a specific need for
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
you know ultimately that's this
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
committee's decision to make but i think
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
given what it relates to which is
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
construction projects it it
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
i think it's well advised to have rule
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
making and i don't think it has to be a
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
lengthy rule making
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you but representative walsh has a
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
point when we did the embedded
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
mathematics course in the fourth grade
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
we wrote language in the bill so you
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to put rule making in
 
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.390 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to put rule making in
place

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
certainly way you can do it so there's a
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
number of ways of doing it and you can
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailor what the rule making is
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
to pertain to as well yes so thank you
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
further questions the department thank
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
you very much i have no other pink cards
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
unless there's somebody out in the
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
audience who wants to speak on this
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing any we'll close this hearing
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
and get ready to go into the next one
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
which is sb 234
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is hearing on requiring student
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
identification cards to include the
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention
 
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.310 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention
lifeline

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.909 align:start position:0%
lifeline
234

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
that's another 233 right there
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%

uh for the record uh first good morning
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair and members of the committee
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
for the record i am ruth ward
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
senator for the 8th district
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to introduce
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
senate bill 234
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
this bill requires
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
student identification cards for public
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
schools and institutions of higher
 
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.950 align:start position:0%
schools and institutions of higher
education

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
to include the telephone number for the
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention lifeline
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
the bill was amended in the committee
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
because we had a whole mess of numbers
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
listed but we decided it would be very
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and the best thing was just
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
to have the national
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require schools to
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
print id cards these are for the schools
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
who already have student id cards to put
 
00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
who already have student id cards to put
it

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
this number on that cards will be easy
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
to get to in case a child is student
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
is in trouble and really needs some
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
quick help
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's fairly straightforward it came out
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
of a resident who whose son had
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
committed suicide
 
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
committed suicide
and

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
really felt that this will be a big help
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
for the students
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm very pleased to see that this
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
morning i received a letter which i
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
think you all have from governor sununu
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the number of students who
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
commit suicide and what age group is
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable so i'm very pleased to
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
be able to produce this
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill for your consideration
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
so the senate education committee is
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
asked for your approval of this bill
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
and with the amendment which was to cut
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
out all the other numbers except one the
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
and again on the letter from governor
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
sununu talks about
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
the mental health problems with our
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
youth and what we can do and i think
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
this is a small
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
effort in that way of keeping our youth
 
00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
effort in that way of keeping our youth
safe

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
i should also mention to you that the
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
mother of this young man
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
had requested if possible to have the
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
bill named in his name and i will leave
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
that up to you
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
and uh one question answer any questions
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes one question for you in in
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
university system new hampshire
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
coordinate this i because it addresses
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention higher education
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
which is our two and four year system
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
was there
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
communication with them
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
that are they in support do you know
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
personally contact any one of them this
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
is an issue that has been talked about
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
so many times that uh
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
oh she did not
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay it came out of the the request came
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's office because she
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's office thank you thank
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i just have a question
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
on li on section four
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
in uh the first part
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
it says the national suicide prevention
 
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.549 align:start position:0%
it says the national suicide prevention
lifeline

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
shall be labeled on student
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
identification cards as
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
the mental health support line
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering why you did that
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
instead of leaving it labeled as the
 
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.549 align:start position:0%
instead of leaving it labeled as the
national

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
line 14 the national suicide prevention
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
lifeline shall be labeled on student
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
identification cards as the mental
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
health support line yeah why did you
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
mental health problems and you're
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about suicide i think that's
 
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
thinking about suicide i think that's
probably

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
what a child might reach for mental
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
health thinking that they're in crisis
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
they need some help versus if they see
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
the national suicide they may not be
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
there yet but i think the mental health
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little easier to take than the
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention line but the suicide

a public school a charter school or
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%

on their student identification cards
like

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you're in an emergency
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%

call 911 or
or

00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%

something like that
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
the reason we did not put all the other
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
names and all the other numbers on is
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
because i don't know how big the id card
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
is but how many numbers can you put on
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
it and which ones are the most important
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes yeah so so um so i'm i'm
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking from that that that this wouldn't
 
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.430 align:start position:0%
taking from that that that this wouldn't
prohibit

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
um any of these institutions from from
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
placing other helpful numbers yes thank
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
you it would not
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
senator technic uh question
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on representative lakers's
 
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on representative lakers's
thing

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better for the students
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
because if i'm contemplating suicide in
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
sixth grade
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
i might
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
correlate that to
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i would think wouldn't it be better
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
maybe say meant or
 
00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:55.350 align:start position:0%
maybe say meant or
suicide

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
suicide
prevention

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
i mean putting that putting one with the
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
other might not correlate to
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
a child's mind that they mean the same
 
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.230 align:start position:0%
a child's mind that they mean the same
thing

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
well as you probably know it's hard to
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the best way to doing
 
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the best way to doing
it

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
kids react to different things
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
and if you can see
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
any other way of putting whatever
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
information is the most important on a
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
card i would say go for it
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know do you decide to have the
 
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.029 align:start position:0%
you know do you decide to have the
national

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
mental health line suicide line
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
emergency line and there are so many
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
things that could be put on the card the
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
question is how much can you put on a
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
card so you can actually see it and it
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
well well
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
quick yeah good for i mean just the
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
if i'm i'm a
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
ninth grader or something and i just
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
break up with my girlfriend then i might
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
think suicide because of that which most
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
kids do
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's not to me that's not mental
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
health that's i broke up with my
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
girlfriend so don't you think maybe
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
adding in
 
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
adding in
all

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
the suicide hotline
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to have uh the national

moments here so
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have these questions
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
regarding mental health versus the
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
the other definition addressed to them

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
considered it an 8.9 percent attempted
 
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.950 align:start position:0%
considered it an 8.9 percent attempted
suicide

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
sb 234 offers a simple solution that has
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
the potential to save lives
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
suicide phone lines provide timely and
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
constant access to a resource that
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
provides support and comfort to those
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
who are actively suicidal
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
printing this number on the back of a
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
student id is a great way to assure that
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
this age group has access to this very
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
important resource for these reasons
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire urges the committee
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
to vote to recommend ought to pass for
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
sb 234
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
and uh any questions for the committee
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
we were discussing earlier what
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
definition we should
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
use within this legislation mental
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
health line and helpline or or
 
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
health line and helpline or or
our

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention line uh you're
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
professional in the field and work in
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
this domain
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
could you give us any advice or comments
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
um well i'm not technically a
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
professional and i work with families
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
through my lived experience
 
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
through my lived experience
um

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.509 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
what the research shows is that
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
the kids just need access to a number
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
um and as the senator said it really
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
either number can be on there
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
the kid
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
the students that i've been working with
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the past year a couple of years we've
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
had a contest around mental health they
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
get it more than we do
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think having either number on
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
there would be helpful
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
the other thing that was mentioned was
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps breaking up with your
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
boyfriend or your girlfriend your
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
significant other
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the data shows that there's never one
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
single cause to suicide
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
so while
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
students may feel hopeless and very sad
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more behind it to those
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
that actively get to that part but we do
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
know as was mentioned that this number
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
really addresses
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
in crisis they don't have to be to the
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the level of um feeling that they're
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to harm themselves at that
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
particular moment but they do have the
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
reach out and help
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
help and talk with them
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that as we move
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
forward to having the national 988
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.310 align:start position:0%
forward to having the national 988
number

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
that is going to be for anybody that's
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
in a mental health or substance misuse
 
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
in a mental health or substance misuse
crisis

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah thank you mr
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking the question i'm
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
has this been done in any other state
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
and how much of an impact did it have
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have the answer to
 
00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have the answer to
that

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
but we do know that having access to the
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
further questions representative cornell
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
do you know if the 988 number after
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
speaking with whoever calls will make a
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
help them make a referral to some place
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
local to talk to or yes so in new
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire when you call this national
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention lifeline or when you
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
call 988 you will be directed to new
 
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
call 988 you will be directed to new
hampshire

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then they will work on making sure
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
it gets to that area and as we do
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
when they call that the goal is to help
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
them at that time hopefully
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need to call 9-1-1 but it's
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's all to de-escalate at that moment
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
in favor of senate bill 234 relative
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
requiring student identification cards
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
to include the national suicide
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
prevention lifeline and i'm going to go
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
off script or some number that will help
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
people if they are in crisis on
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
september 14 2017 we lost our son jason
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
to suicide a day that will haunt us for
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of our lives jason was just 19
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
at the time of his death
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
he loved his friends and family and made
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
everyone around him happy he will always
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
be loved and missed
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
according to the cdc between 2007 and
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
2018 the national suicide rate among
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
young people aged 10 to 24 increased 57
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
percent well it's hard to pinpoint why
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
the rate has gone up we know everybody
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
has their challenges and that has become
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
even more obvious during this pandemic
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
as teen suicide rates continue to rise
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
there are other states that are trying
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for students to reach
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
out for help by putting it right in the
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
palm of their hand when i started to
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
read about this i knew that i had to
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
bring the concept forth here in new
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i am honored to speak here
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of and in favor of this
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill and to thank senator ward for the
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
work that she's done to bring it this
 
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
work that she's done to bring it this
far

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
newly passed laws in south carolina
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
illinois and arizona are putting the
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention lifeline
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
number on student id cards california
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
has required the lifeline to be on id
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
cards since 2019 and several other
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
states currently have similar bills
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
before them as well
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that passing a similar bill in
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would be life-saving
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
showing this level of support to
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
students who may feel vulnerable or
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
unsupported is important and i believe
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
that it will change their lives
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
even though jason was already graduated
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
from high school he kept this id card in
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
his wallet and it was with him that
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
morning when he took his life i can't
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
help but wonder if this id had a number
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
that he could have reached out to
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps he would have called it that
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
morning and saved himself through that
 
00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.950 align:start position:0%
morning and saved himself through that
resource

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
these resources must be made readily
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
available it is our duty as parents
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
educators professionals and lawmakers to
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
help prevent teen suicide to know that a
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
teen reaches out and says help me that's
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
a sign of courage and tremendous
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
strength to infuse hope that there is
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
someone on the other end of a telephone
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether they call or text might give
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
them a chance to know that they're only
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
a call away from talking to a trained
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
expert no matter what a person is going
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
through there is always hope
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
i've said before that even if one life
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
is saved you've all done your part to
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the bill before you and
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
sincerely hope that it passes and i do
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that we consider naming
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
it after my son jason dickey thank you
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%

thank you very much martha are there
 
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:31.349 align:start position:0%
thank you very much martha are there
questions

00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representatives
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
just following up on the same question i
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
noticed you nodding your head and
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
shaking your head when we were
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
discussing that so it seemed like you
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
had an opinion
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
as to which nay i mean the number will
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
be the same but as to how we label it
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
right exactly and i know that that had
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
gone back and forth thank you i was
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
agreeing and not not agreeing to some
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
things um i think that a number to your
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
point that they can look at the back of
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
that card i noticed that jason's is
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
blank he had typed something that says
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
peace of mind comes piece by piece so to
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
me that indicates that the kids look at
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
the back of their ids
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
i think a number that could connect them
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i do agree that the 988 number down
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
the road when that's live would probably
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
be the best bet and then however it's
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
labeled whether it's mental health
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
suicide i think it's all going to tie
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
back and potentially be life-saving
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning chairman
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is

devin quinn and i'm here on behalf of
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire women's foundation
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire women's foundation
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
invests in equality and opportunity for
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
the women and girls of new hampshire
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
through research advocacy education and
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
grant making
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you've heard and
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
we'll hear
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
we also wanted to point out how
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
important and life-saving this bill
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
would be for girls in particular
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
we put out a report in the fall called
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
the status of girls in new hampshire and
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
we saw
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
kj sent around
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
the stats for girls mental health are
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
particularly alarming
 
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.589 align:start position:0%
particularly alarming
girls

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
girls
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
have a higher rate of depression than
 
00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:44.710 align:start position:0%
have a higher rate of depression than
boys

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
boys
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
they have a higher rate than boys for
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
considering suicide
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
and indeed have a
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
higher rate of making a plan
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
to attempt suicide um so
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
oh that those numbers are
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
exaggerated and increased by certain
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
groups of girls of color and by certain
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
regions on the second page you'll see
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
which regions are most impacted
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that that was part of the discussion as
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
well as how impactful this would be on
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
girls lives as well
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.109 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
committee

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone um i served in the
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
marine corps and it's always is hard to
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
do this um so i greatly appreciate you
 
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.150 align:start position:0%
do this um so i greatly appreciate you
um

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak on
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of supporting
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 234
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm a suicide survivor
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a parent i have a daughter who's a
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
freshman at the university of new
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and hopefully actually glad i
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
came i'd always support something like
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
this but also i have a lot of answers to
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
the questions that you're seeking that
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
you've asked
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
so my background is
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
i attempted suicide back in 1986 as a
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
junior at salem high school
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
some of you may know my story because
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
two years ago i testified for the on
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the return to learn concussion
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill which i said using my experience a
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
child that is separated from their peers
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
is a um is a recipe for suicide it just
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
adds to increasing suicide i was a
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
multi-sport athlete at multiple
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
concussions uh it got to the point where
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
i couldn't do my schoolwork and back
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
then it was live your life in a at home
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
in a dark room away from your peers um
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
i testified that it
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
that bill would help
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
students get support by being in the
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
classroom being with their peers and it
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
was in line with the governor's governor
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
sununu's suicide prevention plans that
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
that he's outlined over the years
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
right after that covet hit the covet
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
lockdowns um suicide rates have gone up
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i believe primarily because these
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
students are separated from this
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
from the other students they're teachers
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
as my daughter said to me uh last month
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
when unh took the mask mandates away she
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
said dad i haven't seen a teacher one of
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
any of my teachers faces in three years
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
since i was a junior in high school
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's really impactful
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
i went on to serve in the marine corps
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
well even before that i was one of the
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
first trained peer outreach counselors
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
back in 1986. so that program has been
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
going on for 36 years and what did it
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
teach us
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my phone um what it taught us
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
was that how students can reach out for
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
help out in the community first
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
responders your clergy what have you and
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of what's based around suicide is
 
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of what's based around suicide is
um

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
who you who do you reach out to it's
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
communication problem and you feel

or now as an adult and a veteran or
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
whatnot it's it's what i do
 
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.430 align:start position:0%
whatnot it's it's what i do
um

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%

university of new hampshire and i asked
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
her i said sam
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
mention does it have the suicide
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
prevention hotline number immediately
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
without even looking at it she goes dad
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
not only does it have the number but it
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
also has a text you can text in my
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
daughter is a communication science
 
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
daughter is a communication science
disorder

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
student there she's going to be a speech
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
therapy again it comes back to
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
communication and who's there to help so
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm very proud of my daughter she sent
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
me a copy of her id card and to answer
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's actually i'm so proud of unh and
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
whoever did this and i'm very proud of
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
the and thankful for the family to come
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
forward to bring this i'm like oh my god
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
why don't we think about this sooner
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
i can share with anybody i didn't
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
photocopy it she sent me in a text
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the biggest boldest letters it says
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
emergencies 9-1-1 there's another
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
program called sharp it's a 603 number
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
it says report bias discrimination and
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
harassment and down at the bottom it
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
says national suicide prevention hotline
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
with a text number or the 1 800 number
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
so you know somebody there at university
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has just you know
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing it and so i see that
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
written in the bottom of the bill but
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
maybe there are other schools i haven't
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
called timberlane uh my local high
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
school or whoever but i think this is a
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic thing to do
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
one more thing
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
is i'm a veteran if any of you are
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
veterans and you have a va health card
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
it says right on the back and now i wish
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
it was bigger because as we get older
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
our vision gets worse um veterans crisis
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
line every month i refer veterans to
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
call this phone number
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
and what i've heard from feedback is
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
that a lot of times they actually it's
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
connected with the national hotline the
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention hotline so
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
the question just to answer that i think
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
it should say national suicide
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
prevention hotline
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
i look back as if i was a kid and i had
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
a school id card i couldn't talk to
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
because of stigma i couldn't talk to my
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
coaches i couldn't talk to my friends or
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
my family they didn't know what was
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
going on or i didn't want to burden them
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
this takes the burden away because
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're talking to a trained professional
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether you're an eighth grader or a
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
senior at the university of new
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or a combat veteran you're
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
talking to somebody who is distant from
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
because maybe somebody in the situation
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
that you're in
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're part of the reason of the
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
multiple issues of why you're you're
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
contemplating harming yourself
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative nelson and
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.870 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking my
question

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
any thought for bilingual students that
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
may speak only spanish or something how
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
do they address that maybe i should ask
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
i've been on the national suicide
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
hotline uh there's a website and maybe
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's another thing they could put down
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
is the web page as well again how much
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
room do you have at that point too but
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
they do have people who speak different
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
languages when you call the hotline just
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
like if you're a veteran you call they
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
can ask you are you a veteran and you
 
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
can ask you are you a veteran and you
can

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
it gets tailored down to who you need to
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
speak to and again who you can who can
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
communicate with you best during this
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
crisis so
 
00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.390 align:start position:0%
crisis so
um

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh represent
 
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh represent
litchfield

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that i've struggled with
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
throughout this conversation today was
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
the verbiage of
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
suicide versus mental health i agree
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
with the need for this
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
but i i continue to go through my mind
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
and think that if 11 year olds are going
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
to be carrying the surrounded 12 year
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
olds i have young children i don't know
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that i want them to have the word
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
suicide that seed planted continually in
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
their brain but yet
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with having the number
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
on there you said something interesting
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
where you mentioned the word in crisis
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i was thank you for the question um
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
i was looking at this as well i mean
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good point veterans crisis line
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
that you know i pondered that
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
um this morning as i looked at you know
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
i was looking at all these id cards i'm
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
like wow
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
why didn't they use
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
national suicide prevention hotline or
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
or use the word suicide um
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
because with veterans that's a
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's a tough
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
subject and i understand where you're
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
coming from that's
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good point um
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
and again the veterans crisis line
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
actually routes you to
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
the national suicide prevention hotline
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then services back here so
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd leave that up with the
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
educators and the experts as far as
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
which word to use but as far as unh
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
university students big bold letters
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%

but

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
of the things that are known about new
 
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
of the things that are known about new
hampshire's

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
shortage areas we have
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
54 endorsements that the
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
of those 54 in 2018
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
46 of them were deemed to be critical
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
shortage areas so these would be
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
areas that are education specialists
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
in 2019 of the 54 endorsement areas 50

were deemed to be critical shortage
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
areas and in
 
00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:28.870 align:start position:0%
areas and in
2020

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
of the 54
 
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
of the 54
endorsements

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
endorsements
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
the department uh took a hiatus in 2021
 
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.150 align:start position:0%
the department uh took a hiatus in 2021
and

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
is in the process of trying to collect
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
but at any rate these
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
these three years are pretty good data
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent data
 
00:54:58.319 --> 00:55:00.069 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent data
uh

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i i think
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
at least my awareness there's not much
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
difference in my uh senate district
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
that would give me reason to to to doubt
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that this has gotten much
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
better by the way i should have
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
introduced myself with the outset of
 
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.829 align:start position:0%
introduced myself with the outset of
this

00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative lad uh i am j khan i am
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
from keene uh
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
state senator and uh represent
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh 15 of the 23 towns in cheshire county
 
00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh 15 of the 23 towns in cheshire county
um

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the the basis for
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this bill uh to
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
how the state might address its teacher
 
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.870 align:start position:0%
how the state might address its teacher
shortage

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.710 align:start position:0%
shortage
and

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
both in the recruitment and retention
 
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.270 align:start position:0%
both in the recruitment and retention
study

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
the study would
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
i have a 14-month life span to it
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that it convened in september
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
and concluded its work by november of
 
00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:12.630 align:start position:0%
and concluded its work by november of
2023

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
just to give a sense of how important
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
the senate thinks this is
 
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
the senate thinks this is
uh

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
there are two senators
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
that survived the
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
gauntlet in the senate
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
named to this committee along with three
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
members of the house
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
we are not alone
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
in this kind of study
 
00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
in this kind of study
i

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
just hit my map around 2015.
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that other states were looking at their
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
critical shortages in teacher education
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
i noticed that first in the western
 
00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
i noticed that first in the western
states

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
i consulted with the education
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
commission of the states
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
in filing this bill
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
at that point by november of 2021 20
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
states had completed studies
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
and since that time they've done an
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
updated bulletin and there are more
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
states getting into this so
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is something that we don't need to
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
create out of whole cloth
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
there are lots of ideas that other
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
states have come up with
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
our task i think in new hampshire would
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
be and what best fits our state our
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
budget situation
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh and the needs of school districts
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh to fill the critical shortage areas
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we have in our state and provide
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to the legislature
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we could hopefully act upon in a
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
biennial budget year
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
and provide some
 
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.270 align:start position:0%
and provide some
ideas

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.630 align:start position:0%
ideas
for

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.789 align:start position:0%
for
recruitment

00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
retention uh to ease this shortage
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's all that i've got in my way of
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
presentation and be glad to
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions committee members
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much senator um we
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
have some questions i got a first uh
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
something to ask you
 
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.270 align:start position:0%
something to ask you
um

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
the other day when i was at a meeting in
 
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.069 align:start position:0%
the other day when i was at a meeting in
keene

00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
keene
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get back home trying to
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
get to vermont
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
i ended up in brattleboro
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh going south uh can you do something
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
about posting the signs down there how
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
to get back up to haverhill from
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
from keene from the college
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
that that that's off topic i know it
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
senator i just wonder if i have to call
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
vermont transportation or well all the
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
signs say vermont and i knew i had to
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
get there to the interstate highway
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
let's get to some questions here
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative porter and then
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair all you had to do
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
was go north you try doing that in keene
 
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
was go north you try doing that in keene
okay

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you every day senator for taking
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is just a minor
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
detail sometimes when we set up these
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
committees um it's specified in the
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
statute that uh so many members of the
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
majority party so many members of the
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
minority party are part of the of the
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
committee this does not do that and i'm
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
that matters to you or
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
if that's something we
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
you raise a very good point the idea of
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
having two from the senate was that
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully it would have
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
one member of each party i don't think
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's a partisan issue and
 
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.349 align:start position:0%
it's a partisan issue and
hopefully

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
we'd have
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh one from each party that was the
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're lucky just to get one
 
00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're lucky just to get one
senator

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh tanner you had your
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes it was a
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator khan um it was
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
basically the same question that that
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is bipartisan and it seems like
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
the committee should be bipartisan but
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
in order to make that possible i think
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
it would be wise to put it in the bill
 
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
it would be wise to put it in the bill
um

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
my other suggestion is that the gps or
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
whoever sent you off the vermont side to
 
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
whoever sent you off the vermont side to
haverhill

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
um you could have gone route 10 up to
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
newport but it would have taken three
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
times as long with the frosties right
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is also the route 12 option yes
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
and more frosties
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay i got hit uh representative uh
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
somebody over here first had a hand up
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
just then representative uh
 
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.829 align:start position:0%
just then representative uh
fort

01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
fort
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent ford and then
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
your mike
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
some years ago when i was an academic
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
vice president we had a there was a
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
study done nationally
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
about the number of students in colleges
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
or schools of education
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
who completed the requirements to become
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
a teacher
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
and never applied for certification to
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
do the job
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
and it was something like half
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
of the students
 
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.589 align:start position:0%
of the students
so

01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
that brings to me a different
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
perspective on
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
how are we going about preparing
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
teachers and toward what end and i think
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
that certainly is a significant part of
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
the issue that
 
01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.109 align:start position:0%
the issue that
you're

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
bringing this study
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee forward to
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think we need to look not only at
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the schools and all
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
the economic and other things that apply
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
how are they being prepared and toward
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
what end
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
when more than half of them never apply
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
now it may well be as my wife says and
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
she prepared teachers that after they do
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
student teachers they realize they're in
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong career
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
because it's hard work and no one
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
pretends that otherwise
 
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.349 align:start position:0%
pretends that otherwise
and

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's just that i think those issues need
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
to be factored in as well
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
as the usual culprits of salary and cost
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
and etc etc
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative ford and i
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think pipeline issues are
 
01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:22.850 align:start position:0%
important to solving this issue and
 
01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
important to solving this issue and
[Music]

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
one thing that the time has
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
solved somewhat is that the
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
redistribution of who's attending
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
college and the fields that they are
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
graduating from has changed a lot in our
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
time in higher education
 
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.630 align:start position:0%
time in higher education
and

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
the schools of education have
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
their enrollments have plummeted
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
replaced by many other professions where
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
there is high need as well so
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh but i i think uh mr appleby
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
has a has a pulse on that and and i i
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee this commission
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
sorry this committee
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.230 align:start position:0%
sorry this committee
would

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
would call upon college
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
of education deans
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh to to answer that kind of a question
 
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh to to answer that kind of a question
representative

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much senator uh

representative cornell
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
may be a little anecdotal but i've been
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
hearing that numbers of teachers have
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
just been leaving during the school year
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
just resigning and not caring do you
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
know if any kind of exit interviews have
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
been done with
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
any place to find out what's going on
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
why they're leaving um
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not even waiting to put in
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
their time for retirement or finishing
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
out the school year just saying
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
i i am not aware of that
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
the bill does anticipate that the
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee would would
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
try to reach to some forecast for
 
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.789 align:start position:0%
try to reach to some forecast for
retirements

01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
retirements
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
it will do a look back to 2018
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then look forward to 2026
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and try to get some good figures
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh not seeing any
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%

you mr thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
when did this trend when was it noticed
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
you know ten years ago five years ago
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
three and was any sense of what created
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:18.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
great question thank you i
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
i came to the department four years ago
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
what i can i can speak to that four
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
years i can't speak to prior and i would
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
say that over the last four years we
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know every year that high number of
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
shortages in our survey um
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
as far as uh when it was noticed it i i
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know i think before i arrived at the
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
department it was a fairly high number
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
as well so i think this has been an
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue now for quite a number of
 
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue now for quite a number of
years

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
other questions representative luno sure
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
very much mr appleby um do uh does the
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh does the department um also track
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
i guess availability of qualified
 
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.589 align:start position:0%
i guess availability of qualified
administrators

01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know that qualified to serve as
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
superintendents or building principals
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the state
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um our
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
survey does survey
 
01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:16.789 align:start position:0%
survey does survey
um

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
as senator khan mentioned approximately
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
54 endorsements some of those are
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
administrator endorsements our survey is
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
driven by the u.s uh department of ed
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
because we report the numbers back to
 
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.630 align:start position:0%
because we report the numbers back to
them

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes represent moffat
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your uh
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
testimony for being here so as i look at
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the language of this
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
we see specific mention of loan
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
forgiveness housing assistance tuition
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement scholarships to help fill
 
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.549 align:start position:0%
reimbursement scholarships to help fill
shortages

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
shortages
now

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
i know that the shortages are not uh
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
the same in different disciplines some
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
some disciplines are acute shortages and
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
some i have a social science background
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i taught that and there was never
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
such demand for that
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh candidly as there was for
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
language or math or
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
certain sciences
 
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.789 align:start position:0%
certain sciences
so

01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
um bonus incentives it's not mentioned
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
in the language here and i understand
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the the uh the unions or whatever
 
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.670 align:start position:0%
that the the uh the unions or whatever
uh

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't like that approach but what do you
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
think about bonuses for targeted
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
disciplines where there are acute
 
01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.510 align:start position:0%
disciplines where there are acute
shortages

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think that
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
there are probably any number of options
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
especially senator khan mentioned
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work being done in
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
other states that run the range from
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships for
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
educator preparation programs to
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
registered apprenticeships to bonuses
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
and signing bonuses i've discussed that
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
with numerous superintendents
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
that option so there are a full range of
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
tools i think being tried in other
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
states i mean i just got an article this
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
morning that montana is testing out a
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
four day week uh in its schools as a
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
retention attraction retention tool for
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
educators and i know that's also being
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
done in either alabama or mississippi so
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
the beautiful thing about our country
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
right is that
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
people experiment so there's lots of
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
different options i think that i think
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that study committee can can look
 
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
that that study committee can can look
at

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
steve i was talking to a young man in
 
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
steve i was talking to a young man in
ocean

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
state the other day
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
had graduated from uvm with a degree in
 
01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.269 align:start position:0%
had graduated from uvm with a degree in
english

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
english
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
i asked him had anybody ever suggested
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
to you while you were in college that
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
you should be getting a teacher's ticket
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time he said no
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of that going on where
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
you major in political science or
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
history or music or and you come out
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
without that teacher credential
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
i know when i attended the university of
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
maine it was mandatory in certain
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
programs if you're going to major in pe
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
you also got your certification in
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
another area as well
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
is there any effort on the part of the
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
department to work with higher education
 
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
department to work with higher education
to

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
let them know that the these
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
students that are in the liberal arts
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
areas or any other area might be wise
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
just to hook on to that teacher ticket
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
while you're at school save some dollars
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i represent
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
chair um i think you know those
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
discussions have occurred at the council
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
of teacher education in those meetings
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
around expanding the number of students
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
in their programs and trying to also
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
reach out to students not in their
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
programs but who are
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
pursuing degrees in liberal arts those
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
discussions have happened but there's
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
been nothing formal
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge thank you further
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes representatives
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion about
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
rewarding particularly good students
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
with higher pay as opposed to just
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
working on the
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know you've been here so long you
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
get x amount of money but actually
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
giving some sort of
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
bonus or higher pay or whatever to
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
particularly good student i mean
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
not that i'm aware of but i wouldn't
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily be aware of that as that's
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
an employment
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
issue in the districts but i have not
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
heard any discussion of that
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
i can say that's a very difficult thing
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
as a school administrator
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
i could not keep a science teacher on
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
staff bp or arco
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
any of them on the north slope just
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
picked them up and paid them 10 times
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
when i could pay them in the school
 
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
when i could pay them in the school
district

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you just kind of to answer your
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
question and maybe for information i
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
believe there have been studies done
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
um on the effect of merit pay
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and it
 
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:56.830 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and it
un

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
un
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
surprisingly fails miserably according
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the studies that i've seen it's not a
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a motivator
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
for teachers
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's what i understand
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we have one more pink card
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
here are there any other questions for
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
well we can get it from you
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much steve
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh last one is brian hawkins
anya

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you mr chairman it's good
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be back
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
in house education i think it's only
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
been a couple of weeks
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
since i was here every day with you with
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
all of you but it feels like a lifetime
 
01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
all of you but it feels like a lifetime
um

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
for the record brian hawkins uh today
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
representing nea new hampshire
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
um want to thank senator con
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
in support of senate bill 236 i want to
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank senator khan senator ward and the
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
senate education committee for the for
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan endorsement of this bill
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is one of the critical issues that
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
we need to be
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
focused on going forward and so i think
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
the timing of this is is is very good um
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
as was noted earlier uh school staffing
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
shortages are not new but we are seeing
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
them um you know across every job
 
01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.950 align:start position:0%
them um you know across every job
category

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh in education and um
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a critical need for
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
for the people who matter in this
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
equation the most the students uh what
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly saw during the pandemic
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be in person
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
we need to have the teachers in front of
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
to do that too
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
senator connell already brought up the
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
issue of the critical shortage lists
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we know about
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
pieces of information some of which i'll
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
are at the national level just to
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
highlight the need at the national level
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
there was a report done
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
recently using statistics from the
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
bureau of labor statistics job openings
 
01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
bureau of labor statistics job openings
and

01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
labor turnover survey and the
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
hires to job openings ratio fell below
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
0.5 for the for the second time ever
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
which indicates that the challenge is
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
facing public educa education employers
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
in filling positions
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
remains formidable and the number so the
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
number of educators
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh quitting the profession continue
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh continues to track on the 12-year
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
trend line that began back in 2009
 
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
trend line that began back in 2009
um

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh this trend has seen the
 
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
and and uh this trend has seen the
typical

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
typical
 
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
typical
uh

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
quit rate rise from 0.4
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
per month in august 2009 to 1.1 per
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
month in february 2022.
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh the number of educators
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh in local public education so this is
 
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
uh in local public education so this is
pre-k

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
pre-k
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
through 12 remains uh below pre-pandemic
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
levels by about 331 000 jobs nationally
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
or 4.1
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then when you talk about the at the
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
state level for for higher education
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a deficit there as uh as well
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
um the the the other thing i would just
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
like to highlight from this is um
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
we you know we have had growth uh
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
nationally in in local public education
 
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.830 align:start position:0%
nationally in in local public education
three

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
three consecutive months of losses
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
in higher ed but in in in at the local
 
01:14:44.239 --> 01:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
in higher ed but in in in at the local
level

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
as i said there's still uh
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand fewer educators
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
employed to the today than there were
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
um

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so it just to look at that at the
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
growth rate even though we're seeing
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
growth over the last several months
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
um it um it would take 18 months for
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
local public education nationally to get
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
back to where we were
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
at february 2020 employment levels i
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
realize these are national levels but i
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
think national numbers
 
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
think national numbers
but

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to work with this
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee to really drill down locally
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
and be a resource for this committee
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
some of you may have seen uh there was a
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
recent poll done
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
in look looking forward and why this
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee is important um
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
nea pulled its members
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
nationally uh over 3 600 surveys
 
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
nationally uh over 3 600 surveys
uh

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
scientific polls so
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
more than half 55 percent of members say
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
that they are more likely to leave
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
or retire from education sooner than
 
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.070 align:start position:0%
or retire from education sooner than
planned

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
planned
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's almost double the number saying
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
the same in july of 2020. so a lot of
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
concern i have no doubt there is a lot
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
of that in new hampshire
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
we
we

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
fully support this
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee and i said as i said would be
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
happy to work and be a resources to it
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
to help it uh succeed so with that i'll
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh take any questions and i did notice
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
in reviewing the bill this morning
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
um that there was still as senator khan
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
said i was happy to see that there's
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
still two senators on there who'll be
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
attending the study activity so
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much brian uh i noticed
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
that while you're speaking you had a
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
sheet which you were taking all that
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
information from statistics could you
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
provide that to the clerk or yes i have
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
i have uh hard copies i'll drop off with
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
the clerk thank you very much yes are
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
there questions from brian hawkins
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
um other than covid
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
have you heard any specific order that
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
tend to be any patterns of reasons why
 
01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.990 align:start position:0%
tend to be any patterns of reasons why
teachers

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
leave before retirement time have you
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
heard any specific complaints or
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
anything that are things that could be
 
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.310 align:start position:0%
anything that are things that could be
addressed

01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
addressed
um

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
and actually i think that ties into the
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the piece about the staffing shortage
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
that was was a problem even before the
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic i mean i think uh you're well
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
aware that
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
shed light or exacerbated a lot of
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
problems that we have in our local
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
schools and staffing was certainly one
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
of them it didn't
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
any of the whether it's in new hampshire
 
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
any of the whether it's in new hampshire
or

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
nationally uh a lot of the
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh any closures that we might see right
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
now aren't related to
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
so much to directly to covid but if
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
covid takes out you know five
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
five teachers the staff from here you
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
know we were already at that um
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the brink in a lot of schools
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
for hiring um so uh that's a sort of
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
long way of saying i think staffing
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
issues overall having
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
some of the the
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
survey that was
 
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.350 align:start position:0%
survey that was
done

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
by nea indicated that there's a lot more
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing just a lot more jobs that
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't involve your ability to focus on
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know during lunch time you're
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've got to cover stuff in the
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
cafeteria instead of you know reviewing
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
your lesson plans and things like that
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
so um so i think that's some of the
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
things that that that existed even pre
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic that you know are just are
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
still there and contributing to the
 
01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
still there and contributing to the
problem

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
reps and cordelli
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
oh wow thank you mr chairman uh thank
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
you uh for being here again um just
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
wonder if you know of any schools in new
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire that do exit interviews
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are but um i'd be
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
happy to to get you more information
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
about that um i could certainly survey
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
some of our our various locals and and
 
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.470 align:start position:0%
some of our our various locals and and
see

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
speaking from
 
01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
speaking from
experience

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
do you feel
 
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.510 align:start position:0%
do you feel
that

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
setting class b felony convictions for
 
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
setting class b felony convictions for
different

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
violations by teachers uh political
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
intrusions and restrictions that have
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
been recently
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
set into
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
or presented as rsas
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
or even just as bills or for example the
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
loyalty oath
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
type of bill
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
how much do you think that affects uh
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
teachers decisions when they get to be
 
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.229 align:start position:0%
teachers decisions when they get to be
about

01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
60 years old uh whether they want to
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
really stick around or not
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
i was going to say that uh as you were
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
as you were posing
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
thinking as you were posing the question
 
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.630 align:start position:0%
thinking as you were posing the question
that

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
there's so many factors contributing
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
when when people are reaching that uh
 
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
when when people are reaching that uh
point

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't think it helps i i
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
will say just anecdotally i i have
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
talked to some recent retired
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh teachers who some of them would say
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
boy am i am i glad that i'm retired now
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i think that includes some of the
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
issues that you raised that you know as
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
well as the pandemic and and and all of
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
the the things that have
 
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.550 align:start position:0%
the the things that have
uh

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know resulted
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
there's so many issues in in education
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
so i think i think that's where
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think that's where this
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
getting into it with the study committee
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
will help is we can talk about all of
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
will help is we can talk about all of
those

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.270 align:start position:0%
those
yep

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
one last question then we have to move
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
on to the next
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
revision like
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
two questions okay representative then
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
left represent
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if you could get us that
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
information from the studies that were
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
done beforehand that talked about the
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
various things that teachers complain
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
about like
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
doing extra things like lunch duty and
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff could you get us the
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
results of that uh certainly so it it um
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't drill down as
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
specific as you know uh
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'll i will i will get you the survey so
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
that you can see what it indicates
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative mullin thank you mr chair
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh mr hawkins for taking
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the other end of a career
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning yes
 
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
the beginning yes
um

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of average starting teacher
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
salaries in new hampshire you know let's
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
say within the first five years or
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we know about affordable housing
 
01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.870 align:start position:0%
what we know about affordable housing
shortages

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
possible for uh
 
01:21:56.639 --> 01:21:57.430 align:start position:0%
possible for uh
a

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
work within the public school settings
 
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
work within the public school settings
and

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
live a life that doesn't require either
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
living with their parents or uh
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
finding some sort of alternative
 
01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
finding some sort of alternative
arrangement

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's a i think that is a big
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
challenge particularly as as as we look
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
at you know student you know continuing
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
to have student loans so
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
housing certainly being a pressure for
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
all of us but
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh i think the student loan issue is a
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
big big
 
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
big big
uh

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know has an impact and when people
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
are doing the dollars and cents of how
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
to start their career
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
i do i do think that that is an impact
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
data points i think
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
the salary issue that
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
i know the the school funding commission
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
looked at across the state where our
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
starting salaries where are you going to
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
be in five years
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh if you start that and and the
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
disparity um when you go from
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know pittsburgh to salem
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
and or you know
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
even the next town over so
 
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:08.540 align:start position:0%
definitely in an uh
 
01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
definitely in an uh
[Music]

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
a big component of it that i think um
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
and and something that i hope the
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee will look at
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
could i just ask just one quick yeah
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's not even a follow-up question it's
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
just a request um if you when you're
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
gathering your data for us could uh give
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
us an idea of some of those points of
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
information you know starting
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.030 align:start position:0%
information you know starting
compensation

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
disparity whatever i i would find that
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
helpful absolutely and represent moffitt
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair um
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here we do
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
notice our season ticket holders who are
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
here uh regularly like yourself i know i
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
noticed it doesn't really come with any
 
01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.030 align:start position:0%
noticed it doesn't really come with any
other

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
other
benefits

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
so my real quick question we might be
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds a little bit
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that would go to the committee if
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
there is a committee but i did want to
 
01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:00.550 align:start position:0%
there is a committee but i did want to
ask

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
because i think it's significant uh
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment has gone down significantly
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's documented uh varies from community
 
01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
it's documented uh varies from community
community

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh ten percent it depends but does
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment mitigate in any way
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the teacher shortage in your view
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh i don't not from what i've heard uh
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's district by
 
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's district by
district

01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh you know the impact that
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know a couple of staff or a
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
couple of teachers leaving can can can
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
have on a particular schools you know
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
some of it's the size of the
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
school district um so
 
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.790 align:start position:0%
school district um so
uh

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
i i i think that um i think it's uh an
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
issue in the prevent
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the profession and
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know as we as the study committee
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh commences i think that's something
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that you know be
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
when we look at it at a district level i
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
think that'll that'll that will be also
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
a an interest a an important data point
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh to look at is when we look at by
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
district uh
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
um my question is do you think we should
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
be amending this bill to include the
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
words compensation study because that's
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about and i
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
think we need to be clear and i think
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's a huge factor in teacher retention
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
and even people entering the field and
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we want to make that a
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
specific requirement of the study
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
well we can we can amend and do anything
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
we want with that bill uh when we get to
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
the session where we do that there's a
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot of issues you know for example are
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
are people retiring because i'm now
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
vested in the system i'm eligible for
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
all those retirement benefits i'm going
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
to get out now after eight or nine years
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
not do my 20 because i'm vested uh i
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
think all these compensations issues
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
wrap into a good question should we be
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
studying that more thoroughly probably
 
01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:00.870 align:start position:0%
studying that more thoroughly probably
yes

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
yes
so

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
wrap san luna
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh following on representative
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
moffat's question with respect to
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh when the when the
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
department reported the um the uh the
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
total enrollment the adm for uh for the
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
current um school year following the
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
october first
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment the uh
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the numbers were down substantially
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's what uh what
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt was was referring
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
to uh certainly some of that may be
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic related but um but we don't
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
know where a lot of these kids are
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
either and um and they uh they did not
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh at least based on the efa numbers
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
go into those programs go into other
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
other programs and i think this may be
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
something uh independent of um
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 236 that this committee
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
may want to
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at you know more more
 
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.709 align:start position:0%
take a look at you know more more
closely

01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
closely
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
following you know maybe as we come out
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic as well
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
but um but just to be sure that um that
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're not uh
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not losing um
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
kids uh or that kids are not being being
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
educated we've been losing kids for
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
years and years here and so is higher ed
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
no no demographic i'm talking about the
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
precipitous drop-off that that appeared
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be pandemic related
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
we were having a precipitous drop-off
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
when i got in here we had 220 000 kids k
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
through 12. now we're down what 160 170
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
so and it's not all pandemic we no
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
nobody's dropping off no no but i'm
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
talking i'm just talking about the the
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
the specific numbers from fy
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
21 to fy22
 
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
21 to fy22
um

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and just just taking a look at
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
that because i think that did not
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
follow the the trend line that uh that
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
had been you know uh
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
built up over a decade or more
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's just something that i think this
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee may want to take a look at
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
we we can look at all the information
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
once if this community is going i'm sure
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
further questions of brian hawkins thank
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have any other pink cards on
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
this one so we'll close this hearing
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has to stand up and stretch a
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:33.350 align:start position:0%
little bit
um

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and stretch for
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
four or four minutes here and then we'll
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
i had a lot of teachers where i was
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
before who were once they became vested
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the system and they had a retirement
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
they they left
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
earned big money with industry came back
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
and bought in years that they'd had in
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the military etc and
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.709 align:start position:0%
 
a

01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
use of the registry established by the
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
national association of state directors
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
teacher education and certification
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that there can be
 
01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
so that there can be
a

01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
a
look

01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
at the licensing
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
that may have occurred for a candidate
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
seeking licensure in new hampshire
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
what their status might have been in
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
another state
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why this cross-state registry
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
is being suggested by the department to
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
put into the enabling act relative to
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
its licensing function
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
you should have in front of you
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment that
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
i hope somebody in the committee would
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh bring forward
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
that uh adjusts uh item three in the
 
01:52:35.119 --> 01:52:35.910 align:start position:0%
that uh adjusts uh item three in the
bill

01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:36.709 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:37.669 align:start position:0%
uh
that

01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh also anticipates that
 
01:52:40.719 --> 01:52:41.910 align:start position:0%
uh also anticipates that
uh

01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
some of the the
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
sharing of registry information could be
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
an intergovernmental compact
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
again authorizing legislation that would
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
enable the department to work with the
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
governor and executive council
 
01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.229 align:start position:0%
governor and executive council
to

01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.239 --> 01:53:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
enable

01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
enable
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of reciprocity to be entered
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.270 align:start position:0%
that kind of reciprocity to be entered
into

01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
so that's the nature of the bill and i'm
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
glad that
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
attorney diana fenton and director
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh appleby are both here to to speak to
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you very much senator are
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
there questions from senator khan
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
or to senator khan
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is maybe more
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
for you than for senator khan
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that he brought forward
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
we have to have a house version of this
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
is that right we cannot amend this bill
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
with the senate amendment that that's
 
01:53:40.639 --> 01:53:41.669 align:start position:0%
with the senate amendment that that's
correct

01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think i asked uh senator khan to
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
present that though so we could see it
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
and have in front of us and we'd know
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
what he was referencing and speaking
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
about thank you very much
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it had to be presented by somebody
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%

to finance and that's why i'm asking
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%

numbers but in full disclosure there was
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute that told us we could
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%

participating in that um is there any
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
reason that we're not participating in
 
01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:24.790 align:start position:0%
reason that we're not participating in

01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
help us
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh as far as criminal background checks
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
and just to add to that for the record
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
diana fenton i'm an attorney for the
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a member of nasdaq
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
nasdaq is the national group that tracks
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
educator misconduct so while the state
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire through the department
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
of ed maintains
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
the revoked and suspended educator list
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
the national group is nasdaq and states
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
can be members new hampshire is an
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
active participating member we have been
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
checking nasdaq routinely and regularly
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
however the law provides that if we use
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
social security numbers
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
which we can we can either check by date
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
of birth or social security numbers
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's a law that says if you use
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
social security numbers you have to put
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
that in your you have to have statutory
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do so so that's
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.510 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
department

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy to address representative
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
nelson's question that he asked of
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
senator khan yeah that that'd be fine
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll have reps and luna after
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative nelson's question
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
um so to address the amendment um that
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
senator khan kindly brought forward
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
this would give the department of
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
education access to other states
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh dcyf for their or their equivalent
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
the division of children youth and
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
families they're central registries for
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect this legislative body
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
last session uh passed a law which
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
allowed the department of education to
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
work with its sister state agency dcyf
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
to gain access to the central registry
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
findings on the central registry for
 
01:59:25.119 --> 01:59:26.229 align:start position:0%
findings on the central registry for
abuse

01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily criminal they are
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
administrative so they would not
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily show up on a criminal
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
for either employment or credentialing
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
purposes the department felt that it was
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
a kind of a common sense safe measure to
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
work with our sister state agency
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
while we were working on that bill and
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
putting that in place and we're
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on building that
 
01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:50.070 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on building that
infrastructure

01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
we were advised that an individual from
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts who was on the
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts dcf their their version of
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
dcyf their central registry came to new
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and is licensed to teach
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and was
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
employed as a teacher in the state of
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
we took the measures that we had to
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
internally to address that situation but
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
in doing so we began talking to our
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
counterparts in massachusetts and they
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
agreed to work with us to allow
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
education access to the massachusetts
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
gcf registry
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty exciting step to be honest
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
with you because
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts department of
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
education doesn't even have access to
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
that list i hope this isn't being
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
recorded and watched in massachusetts
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
so we i think are in a unique position
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
all jokes notwithstanding to to really
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
strengthen um the security by which we
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
issue a credential and it's important to
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
recognize that school districts don't
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
have access to the central registry of
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf that
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're not a sister state agency they
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
can't access that but the department can
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
and so when we look at this language
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative nelson to address your
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
question we would be looking at the
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
applicant's name to see if the applicant
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
has had a finding of abuse in either new
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire dcyf or massachusetts dcf
 
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.629 align:start position:0%
hampshire dcyf or massachusetts dcf
registry

02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
you follow up thank you mr chairman
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if i was a child and i was abused yes
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
would that show up
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
by name most likely not um the names of
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
the individuals are either abbreviated
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
or redacted but when we have access to
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the central registry and to be honest
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
with you i've never
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
personally seen the central registry the
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
reason is i'm not authorized
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
we limit within our mou we limit the
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
authorization to have access to it so we
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
at the department of education had to
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
sign some agreements confidentiality
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
agreements it's covered in the
 
02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.310 align:start position:0%
agreements it's covered in the
memorandum

02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
memorandum
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have access to it i'm not one of
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
the authorized people who has access
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
same thing with massachusetts but i can
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
assure you both states take the
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
precautions they have to to
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
deal with that situation but what what
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
is the name of the person who is
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
applying to teach we're not looking for
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
the details of the offense
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
can i
 
02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
can i
just

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
i guess how it's worded it's just i'm
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
sorry for a quick crazy question like
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're going after i understand as a
 
02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
you're going after i understand as a
teacher

02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
have i ever i assume have you ever
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
abused anybody
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
but how it's reading
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
you could say was i ever abused as a
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
by somebody else
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
growing up i'm not a teach
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate that question and um
 
02:02:41.199 --> 02:02:42.310 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate that question and um
i

02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
i have uh from time to time been guilty
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
of really bad writing so i appreciate
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to look at it i think
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
when and i'm happy to to reword it um
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
but when you look at it in totality it's
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
looking for a finding of abuse
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
for people who are applying to teach and
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
so when i think i think when you look at
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
it outside of this amendment and put it
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
in totality hopefully it makes sense but
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you bringing that to my
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
attention happy to work on that
 
02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
attention happy to work on that
representative

02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually the um the the the back and
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
forth uh between representative nelson
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
and um and attorney fenton i think um
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh helped address uh my uh
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know questions that that that i
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
was thinking but um but um attorney
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
fenton you do refer to the the the
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
nasdaq as as as essentially having
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
findings they're not necessarily
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
criminal but their findings correct do
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
they does it also contain anything
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
prior to a finding maybe that an
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
investigation is pending or hasn't been
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
completed on a uh on an individual
 
02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:51.189 align:start position:0%
completed on a uh on an individual
it

02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
it could yes so my understanding of
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
nasdaq um
 
02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.790 align:start position:0%
nasdaq um
and

02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's unique because every state
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
puts their own information in and so
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
every state kind of has their own rules
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
by by which
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
they decide what they enter
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
but for example with new hampshire if
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone is under investigation and that
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
is a term of art pursuant to our
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we enter that
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
person into nasdaq so other states would
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
see that that person is under
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
investigation um
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
and then when that investigation is
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
closed if it's not founded we remove
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
them if it's founded we make that that
 
02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
them if it's founded we make that that
notation

02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
notation
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i know other states probably follow
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
similar guidelines
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
and other states might just put in the
 
02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.390 align:start position:0%
and other states might just put in the
findings

02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
findings
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
uh

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh
steve

02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
steve
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or diane um
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
figure out why we have to you know to
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
access findings of abuse of these
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
individuals we have to have an mou by
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
the governor and
 
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.350 align:start position:0%
the governor and
council

02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh when we could put that in statute or
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
some you know
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
why why this route that you've got here
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
how would that mou be
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
put together
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you for the question um
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for the approval by governor
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and council is because we have to
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
recognize this is an interstate
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
agreement it is not just new hampshire
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
doe working with new hampshire dcyf this
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
is the state of new hampshire entering
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
into an agreement with the state of
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and that's why my
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is the governor and
 
02:05:30.239 --> 02:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
understanding is the governor and
council

02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
approval is required
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the memorandum of
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
understanding i can tell you that
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
that is a great document for
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the department to have it really
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
lays out it's kind of a contract
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
right it's it's somewhat of a contract
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
it lays out the understanding from both
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
parties and we have both commissioners
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
sign it even though not uh i don't think
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
it was required but we entered into a
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with new
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire dcyf to just lay out
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
how this was going to work and what the
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
expectations of both parties were so as
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
a practical matter i think it really
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
helps facilitate
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the end objective and the end goal um
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and it is the state version of a
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
contract for lack of a better term
 
02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.430 align:start position:0%
contract for lack of a better term
so

02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to possibly set
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
up mousse with
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
49 states
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
well we're going to start with one
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
with massachusetts i i don't know if the
 
02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.550 align:start position:0%
with massachusetts i i don't know if the
vision

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
vision
 
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
vision
is

02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
having this be nationwide we have we
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
have entered into a discussion with
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and massachusetts has
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
agreed to do this um but other states
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
don't have to do this when i went to
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
write this law i will tell you i was
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
kind of stymied because i i said to my
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
co-counsel i said i can't write a law
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
that binds another state
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
i can't write a law that says
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts shall
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
enter into this agreement
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so this was the best language i
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
could come up with i don't know if the
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
vision is to
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
expand this to all 50 states
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it certainly would be the
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
department's hope to start with
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and potentially add on
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
for our purposes
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
of licensing people
 
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
of licensing people
that

02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
that makes comments it's a common sense
 
02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
that makes comments it's a common sense
approach

02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh to this situation that we're dealing
 
02:07:22.639 --> 02:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
uh to this situation that we're dealing
with

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's too bad it's not a national deal we
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
we know with our intergovernmental
 
02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
we know with our intergovernmental
uh

02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
school districts those are approved by
 
02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.229 align:start position:0%
school districts those are approved by
congress

02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
congress
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
not through an mou
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
and if we're dealing with teacher
 
02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
applicants or folks we're looking at
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
from all over this country uh it seems
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
to me wouldn't it be wiser to have
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
something done on the national level
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
maybe through one of these organizations
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of uh
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
then to do it individually you know with
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
maine and then mass and then everybody
 
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
maine and then mass and then everybody
else

02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know ideally my wish list would be
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we could work on a national level
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
on this
um

02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe someday that's
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
possible but working with the here and
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
now with what we have i think this is a
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
really great start and when we share
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
this idea with other people
 
02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.629 align:start position:0%
this idea with other people
they

02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
they go oh yeah
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you have access to new
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire dcyf and in massachusetts it's
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity and so um i do think
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has given us a wonderful
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity i would be remiss if we
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
missed that that chance um and maybe
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
someday it could go on a national level
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're just not there quite yet well
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a federal
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
doe we do
 
02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
doe we do
okay

02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you keep giving me different ranks
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
maybe i could i could approach them so
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
well you want to be governor
 
02:08:45.199 --> 02:08:48.310 align:start position:0%
well you want to be governor
no

02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay represent lekkas
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at the wording and i
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if this actually makes sense
 
02:08:59.599 --> 02:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
don't know if this actually makes sense
but

02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you changed in line
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the word for to buy
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
it would be findings of abuse by
 
02:09:08.639 --> 02:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
it would be findings of abuse by
individuals

02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
on the central registry it all depends
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
upon where you put your commas which
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.679 --> 02:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that i think you might
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
have just solved my problem okay thank
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the word smithing
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'll take all the help
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:32.390 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
department

02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have any other cards on 350
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
up here
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%

02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
the reason this came forward is we have
 
02:10:28.639 --> 02:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
the reason this came forward is we have
been

02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.669 align:start position:0%
been
adjusting

02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
adjusting
 
02:10:31.679 --> 02:10:32.470 align:start position:0%
adjusting
uh

02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
our procedure for
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that
 
02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that
in

02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
at least the last few years
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
last four years and
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the department probably feels
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
like it's every year
 
02:10:51.199 --> 02:10:52.709 align:start position:0%
like it's every year
and

02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
they've been doing that in collaboration
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the department of safety
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
so that they can do those criminal
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
history background checks uh do the fbi
 
02:11:04.079 --> 02:11:05.669 align:start position:0%
history background checks uh do the fbi
check

02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
check
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
across the state and by the way you also

02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.669 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
the department called to my attention
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:11:38.639 --> 02:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
was that
uh

02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
i mean you know the problem that there
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
is with substitute teachers uh we we
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh districts have really struggled
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic to
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
to have sufficient coverage
 
02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
to have sufficient coverage
and

02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh substitute teachers are often trying
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
to fill in their schedule
 
02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
to fill in their schedule
by

02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
offering to be
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh substitutes in multiple schools
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
and those schools could be in multiple
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
districts but under the same sau
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
and this bill tries to
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that kind of situation
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
that a sau and that school
 
02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.229 align:start position:0%
that a sau and that school
superintendent

02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
could do that background check
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
maintain that record of the background
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
check and then that teacher could be
 
02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
check and then that teacher could be
authorized

02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
to substitute
 
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
at any of the
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
locations school buildings
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh within that sau
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the intention here i hope the
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
words and the
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
punctuation is uh
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
adequately done to uh
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll claim that i've read this more
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
often uh than anyone else and should
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
have caught them if uh
 
02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:55.830 align:start position:0%
have caught them if uh
but

02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.430 align:start position:0%
but
[Music]

02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department is here to uh and diana
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
fenton i think is the
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
person who worked this out with
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
different uh education organizations to
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
bring this forward to the senate
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
so we're glad to answer any questions
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
but i think the department's in a good
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
position to answer those thank you mr
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much are there
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
senators khan
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative cornell thank you and
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this question is for you
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why is it isn't across
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
other saus
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't i can't answer okay
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
i have a similar type question where we
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
use substitutes where i am that come
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
from the other side the river
 
02:13:41.679 --> 02:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
from the other side the river
so

02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
is there any if a criminal
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
check is done in vermont
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
is that good for just coming across the
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
river and working here i see
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
ms shea back there shaking her head no
 
02:13:56.159 --> 02:13:57.669 align:start position:0%
ms shea back there shaking her head no
um

02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%

02:13:57.679 --> 02:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
um
okay

02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.149 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing any is there any desire to
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
have the department of state yes
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
represent i knew you'd be the first one
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator thank you mr
 
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:18.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator thank you mr
chairman

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee is this on red is on right
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay um my name is vic mazzy i'm a
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
captain with the state police in charge
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the justice information bureau which
 
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
of the justice information bureau which
includes

02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
includes
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
the criminal records unit
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
um so i think we've got two questions
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'll let you decide who wants to ask
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
first or well if you just want to speak
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
to some of those things that we're
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
discussing sure certainly so i think the
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
one question is um
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
the distribution of records if you will
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
from one sau to the other
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment the fbi won't allow that
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're at their mercy so as it stands now
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
there is a representative in an
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
alternate for each siu which has been
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
authorized by the fbi to receive the
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
records for that sau
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
so unless
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
we worked out the details with the fbi
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to share between
 
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.629 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to share between
districts

02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
nor would we be able to share between
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
states i guess is the other part of that
 
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
states i guess is the other part of that
question

02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative mullen
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
coming in to answer questions for us
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
today so my question is somewhat related
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
to representative cornell's question uh
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
i understand that the fbi is in charge
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
of that decision
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
are there any industries or professions
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly education can't be the
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
only one where somebody contracts for
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
providing services from town to town i
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
mean is there in your estimation is
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
craft something that would allow
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
a speech pathologist to go from
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
community to community without requiring
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
a background check in every community
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they work in
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
presently no
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
um unless it was worked out through the
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
department of ed but i don't want to
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
speak for them
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
well we have the attorney coming up
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
right beside you sprinting printing as
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
best i can
 
02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
best i can
um

02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
hi i missed everyone in the two minutes
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
i was sitting down
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the record diana fenton i'm an
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
education um that is a question that has
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
been posed to the department many times
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe there was a
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
brought forward that would establish
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
that steady commission
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
to look at that exact issue
 
02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
to look at that exact issue
of

02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
professionals or individuals who are
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
going from district to district and and
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
could the department of education play a
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
centralized role
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
in helping to facilitate that
 
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:10.950 align:start position:0%
in helping to facilitate that
um

02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully that will pass and be
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative mullin and i will be
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
working on this summer together
 
02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:21.030 align:start position:0%
working on this summer together
committee

02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
but this bill
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
just deals with the substitute teachers
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it deals with a unique situation
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
where they work in the same sau they
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
work within one sau but there are
 
02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:33.030 align:start position:0%
work within one sau but there are
multiple

02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
school boards and and districts within
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
that sau and so
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is a situation that was brought to
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
the department's attention by the school
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
boards association
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we worked with them to address this
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
and try to craft this solution
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we need substitute
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
teachers and we need substitute teachers
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
who have mobility
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
and so this is kind of a small step to
 
02:17:55.599 --> 02:17:57.270 align:start position:0%
and so this is kind of a small step to
address

02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
a big problem
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
and it would be limited to only that sau
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
to alleviate substitute teachers from
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
having to undergo multiple checks within
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
one sau and at the same time
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
our hope is that it does not violate any
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
fbi regulations because there is no
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
dissemination of the record it's all
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
housed within the sau it's just
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this person has been
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
cleared and and it's not necessary to
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sheriff and uh thank you
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i know if this is
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
best addressed to captain mazzy or
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
ambassador fenton or the or the uh prime
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor but
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh so you have a
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
a substitute teacher who has been
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
cleared by one or more districts or saus
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
or whatever so they've had their
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
background check and they're cleared and
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
they go on spring break to florida and
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
they get into trouble you can fill in
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
the blank but some felony that that
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
they're charged with and convicted of in
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
florida or wherever
 
02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
florida or wherever
so

02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
um if
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
does this
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
this conviction
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
a felony conviction
 
02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:09.910 align:start position:0%
a felony conviction
scenario

02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
did the folks in new hampshire ever find
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
out about that um
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
my question here i do um and that's an
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
issue that is discussed
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
quite a bit when this topic comes up i
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
think the short answer to your question
 
02:19:24.719 --> 02:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
think the short answer to your question
is

02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
no based on that scenario that person
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
could come back go back to work and
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
it would not necessarily be known
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
in all fairness there is a program at
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
dos is it rat back or wrap back yes
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
which one's a wrap
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
wrap back
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
so there's a program
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
program called rap
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
back and some states no new hampshire is
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
not one of them
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
but there is a program and i think in a
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
few years this legislative body will
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
hear of it there is a program by which
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
those out-of-state offenses would be
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
automatically sent
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
to the state where the individual holds
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
a license
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
and some states participate in that
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
program so for example the state of
 
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
program so for example the state of
pennsylvania

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
every monday the new the pennsylvania
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
department of education gets a list
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
of licensed professionals whether it's
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
teachers or lawyers or whatever who have
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
been arrested
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of pennsylvania
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that's part of their program of
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining their licensure
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
and other states have it
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
on a national level that they would
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
receive that information
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not one of them but my
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that something dos is
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tanner
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
question so you're talking about
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
substitutes that have
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
the same employer so for example like um
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
well keirsarger
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know that has eight towns in their
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
district and they have an elementary
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
school in like three different towns and
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
whatever but the superintendent
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically is in charge
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
of the district and is the
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
employer i mean the school board's the
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
employer but the superintendent would be
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
the person that does the
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
receives receives the criminal
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
background check so
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is this bill simply
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
states in statute that if they're within
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
that district
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and and where you have like the
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
dresden district up in
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
in hanover
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh you have norwich vermont and hanover
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but they have the same
 
02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:45.270 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but they have the same
employer

02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
does that apply there as well
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
correct i think that it would i mean the
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
example that the school boards
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
association always gives us the
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
come join us you stay right there okay
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
come right in the middle sorry
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh becky wilson school boards
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
association so the the catalyst for this
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill really is that the criminal
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
background check for sau employees that
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.319 --> 02:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know siu 24 for example is made up
 
02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
of stoddard john stark henniker and ware
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
school districts but there's only one
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
designee or superintendent who obtains
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check for a
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
substitute employee for all of those
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
and because the same person previously
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
the way the current rule is has to apply
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
for that criminal background check for
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
that substitute for each district the
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
same person is getting the exact same
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
report four or five times um and then
 
02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
bringing that information not the actual
 
02:22:49.359 --> 02:22:50.389 align:start position:0%
bringing that information not the actual
physical

02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
physical
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
background check but just the
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
information from that to the multiple
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
school boards to get permission to hire
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to just eliminate
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
the same person getting multiple
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
copies and having to pay the fee for
 
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
example to get the additional copies for
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
the information that they got two days
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
ago for the same person so that that
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
person can sub at where and then the
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
next day sub in henniker
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not about
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
multiple people getting copies of the
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
criminal background check it's not about
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
the copies going anywhere it's just that
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
the same person and that designee is
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
what a complex issue uh if i'm um
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
working in a
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
career technical education center
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about regional
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
agreements now which may involve
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple different districts
 
02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple different districts
um

02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
how's that going to how is the getting a
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
substitute going to relate
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
if they're approved in one of those
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
sending districts are they good for all
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
the other districts because they're all
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
part of that regional agreement
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question cte centers i
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
think would be a little bit different
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
however the employ who is the employer
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be the question and what school
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
board would approve that person's
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
contract even though the substitute
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
may only be getting one criminal
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
background check and that's going to one
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent each district still is
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
hiring that person under a separate
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
contract potentially or under a
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
substitute contract so it would really
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
that person would not travel for example
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
from crtc to sugar river valley as a
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
substitute those are two totally
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
different employers
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
and different um completely different
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
saus so those
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
career technical ed centers are still
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
covered under those saus and they would
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
still need two different background
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
checks crazy
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
represent litchfield
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i understand the legislation
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
definitely based on what i'm hearing i
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
definitely support it i just wanted to
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
go back to representative moffett's
 
02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.710 align:start position:0%
go back to representative moffett's
question

02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so and regarding this wrap back program
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
so right now as it stands with these
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
substitutes they'll be checked again
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
under this bill every three years is
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
that correct so we may not catch it near
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
two or three but we would catch it at
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
the third year and then i just wanted to
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
clarify we've discussed it before and
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm drawing a blank
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
any of our
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
teachers or certified staff that we hire
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
do we run the background check when
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're initially hired but we don't do
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
that again or is that based on
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
individual school policy yeah okay um
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
that would be a good question for the
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
department as we move into the cycles of
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh criminal background checks being with
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
the licensing piece but yes i mean
 
02:25:36.309 --> 02:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
when you first are employed you are
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
getting that criminal background check
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
through your employer
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
may i follow up go ahead
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
um may i just ask how we came up with
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
the the three year point to check it why
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
not two or whatever that's the cycle for
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
your license chair through the
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
department in terms of your educational
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
license it's good for three years
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.479 --> 02:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
what happened if you have a life ticket
 
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.349 align:start position:0%
what happened if you have a life ticket
i

02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
i wish that thank you for the question i
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
wish there was such a thing i have five
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
department of beds
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
make up in three years any time nelson
 
02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
make up in three years any time nelson
great

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
as a retired special ed teacher i live
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
near three
 
02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.510 align:start position:0%
near three
saus

02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
saus
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i go through the process to go to one
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
of them and they only want me three days
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
a week and all of a sudden i get called
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
from another one would i come it's an
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
emergency situation
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
i have to wait for the
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
check to go through how long does that
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
all take
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question some of
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
that might be a department of safety
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
question it really depends i think on
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
capacity of doing the criminal
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
time of year plays a big part of that we
 
02:26:48.399 --> 02:26:49.349 align:start position:0%
time of year plays a big part of that we
often

02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
often
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
when we're hiring people at the sau
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
level in the fall
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
or in august the background checks take
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
longer because there's a lot of
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
districts that are doing a lot of hiring
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
it just really depends on
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
capacity thank you thank you further
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative cornell
 
02:27:05.359 --> 02:27:06.469 align:start position:0%
questions representative cornell
don't

02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
saus or schools only call people who are
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
on their pre-approved sub-list
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you would not
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
be able to hire someone as a substitute
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
if they weren't already employed by the
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
district which would require going
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
through these channels of having to have
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
it's the same process for bus drivers
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's just thank you for the question
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different and i would
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
defer that to the department because now
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
they're overseeing background checks for
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
bus drivers
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
so can you get a substitute bus driver
 
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the district driving for you there's
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
been a real shortage of drivers here in
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
i mean that's really a question for the
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
department but they are overseeing the
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
bus drivers again you would still have
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
to follow whatever process it is to be
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
approved as a bus driver for that
 
02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:58.230 align:start position:0%
approved as a bus driver for that
district

02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
a law was passed
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
by a legislative session
 
02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
by a legislative session
which

02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.429 align:start position:0%
which
centralized

02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
centralized
 
02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:06.309 align:start position:0%
centralized
the

02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
criminal history record clearance for
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
bus driver within the department of
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
education to address your issue of
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
mobility to allow bus driver to
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
work as substitute subscribers in other
 
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
work as substitute subscribers in other
districts

02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
not cnn thank you very much thank you
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other cards pink cards for
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay we have no other cards and we have
 
02:28:35.790 --> 02:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
one other bill here prior to lunch
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
353 relative to education professional
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
you need 30 seconds here
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
clark needs 30 seconds to get the
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
does this mean if a bill
 
02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.830 align:start position:0%

payback is when they serve a third term
and

02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
and

other
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
new newbies coming onto the board so
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's the intent uh
 
02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:10.150 align:start position:0%
that's the intent uh
nothing

02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%

just for my own
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
personal edification
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%

02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:31:34.399 --> 02:31:35.270 align:start position:0%
no
okay

02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
but i gotta notice that somebody can
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you very much
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
hello again uh thank you steve appleby
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
division director department of
 
02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:57.030 align:start position:0%
division director department of

education
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question um an
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
instructional specialist would be for
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
example a reading writing specialist who
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
works with teachers on improving their
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
their practice of how they teach reading
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
and writing an educational specialist
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
for example would be a guidance
 
02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:14.870 align:start position:0%
for example would be a guidance
counselor

02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
who is an educator educator being an
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
umbrella term but they don't actually
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
teach a class
 
02:32:21.359 --> 02:32:22.710 align:start position:0%
teach a class
typically

02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
typically typically school psychologist
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied with that response
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you are
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite satisfied with this
 
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.389 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite satisfied with this
response

02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:32:42.399 --> 02:32:43.429 align:start position:0%
response
um

02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
you've got nine members representing
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers
 
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers
um

02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it says or educational you've
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
crossed out or
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
educational specialists and i understand
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
those are people who are going to be
 
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
working in a school
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then instructional specialists
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
does that include like people from
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
prenda that are working in the micro
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
schools or people who are working in
 
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools who are perhaps
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
not certified
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
good question thank you and and no we
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually have a category for late people
 
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
who are not certified
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
so there are several seats for lay folks
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh on the psp the the
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of line 10 of adding that
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
language we've been trying to
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
update our terminology and our statutes
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
and rules now for several years to be
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
more in line nationally with what's used
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
around the country makes it easier for
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
licensed reciprocity and talking to
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
other states and this is just part of
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
that ongoing three sb 350 had some
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
terminology adjustments as well so this
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
is just updating the terminology and
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're not excluding
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
certain classes of license holders under
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
the current statute we're excluding
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
instructional specialists
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
so the intent here was just to add that
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
in so that
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
those folks can serve as well
 
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up yes go ahead
 
02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:14.469 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up yes go ahead
so

02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
when you talked about instructional
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
specialists before
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
it sounded like um it included
 
02:34:20.319 --> 02:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
it sounded like um it included
consultants

02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
consultants
 
02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.590 align:start position:0%
consultants
um

02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:24.389 align:start position:0%
um
to

02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh come in to help teachers teach
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
for example reading
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they would have for
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
professional development classes or uh
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
so um reading writing specialists for
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
example that is a licensed
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh position yes so we hand out a license
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
for reading writing specialist
 
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
math specialists we have a license so
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's what that's referring to is those
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
licensed individuals who work in a
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
school and work with teachers but are
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
not themselves directly teaching okay
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
and just one other follow-up
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
so i i quickly went on the professional
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
standards boards
 
02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a there's like three
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
vacancies under that particular part
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
and two vacancies under higher ed
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
educational administration
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
um can you explain why there
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
are possibly vacancies and what can be
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
done to fill those vacancies
 
02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:19.030 align:start position:0%
done to fill those vacancies
yes

02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um you
 
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
know one of the issues that we've run
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
into the last several years is you know
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly significant time
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
commitment of those who volunteer to be
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
on the professional standards board and
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
certainly um with with the pandemic and
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
everyone being
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
really pulled in many many directions we
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
saw a drop-off in applicants we've since
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
seen that pick back up and there are
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually a number of applications at the
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
state board level uh waiting to be
 
02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
state board level uh waiting to be
vetted

02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
vetted
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
and and reviewed by the state board and
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
voted on so i would anticipate those
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies over the next few months will
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
be filled
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the ball
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh mr
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
appleby yes represent luno thank you
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair um as a as a
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
follow-on to representative tanner's um
 
02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:05.349 align:start position:0%
follow-on to representative tanner's um
question

02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh and i and i may be getting at
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
existing language as opposed to
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know amended language but looking at
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
lines 9 and 10
 
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:15.429 align:start position:0%
lines 9 and 10
um

02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:15.439 --> 02:36:16.950 align:start position:0%
um
in

02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
roman 1b
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
nine members representing classroom
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
teachers education specialists or
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
that could
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
would it be your interpretation of that
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
line that um that that could mean nine
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
members representing just instructional
 
02:36:35.439 --> 02:36:39.190 align:start position:0%
members representing just instructional
specialists

02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes that would be possible however the
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
state board would have to appoint them
 
02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:45.510 align:start position:0%
state board would have to appoint them
so

02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
but that would be possible okay would so
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on that yes what would it
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
would it would it be more consistent
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
with the legislative intent
 
02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
with the legislative intent
of

02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
of lines nine and ten
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the nine members
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
to be representing classroom teachers
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
and education specialists and
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't know as i can answer that i
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
think that would work as well i don't
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know in practice if there's any
 
02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:19.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know in practice if there's any
difference

02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
well so um so follow up on that um
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's obviously a difference
 
02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
because the amendment is introducing
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
this instructional specialist and you've
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
defined that there's a difference
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
between an instructional specialist and
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
an educational specialist
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i guess you know
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
my ques a question would be
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
how is it how's it currently done in
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
practice right now with these nine
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
members representing classroom teachers
 
02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:49.990 align:start position:0%
members representing classroom teachers
or

02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
education specialists reading from the
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:54.710 align:start position:0%
existing language
so

02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
individuals holding certificate
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
credentials in one of those areas apply
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be on the professional standards
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
board and the state board of education
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
vets those applications and uh votes on
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
those applications to appoint or not to
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
appoint to the professional standards
 
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
board all right so follow up on that
 
02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
board all right so follow up on that
um

02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're using the on line nine it says
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
nine members representing and so i i
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
interpreted that as maybe even somebody
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
like like mr hawkins who who represents
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
um i forget the number
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand teachers from from from
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
across the state he technically is a
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative of of
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
of classroom teachers
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
so could somebody like like mr hawkins
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
be a member of the board or is it as
 
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:46.870 align:start position:0%
be a member of the board or is it as
you've

02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
you've
 
02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
talked about um
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that actually holds a uh
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
a um
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
a license in those fields
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a good question um
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
strictly reading this i i would say yes
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh past practice that has not been the
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
case okay
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
so final question would in in order to
 
02:39:11.439 --> 02:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
so final question would in in order to
to

02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
to
to

02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
line up with past practice and
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
potentially the
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
the original legislative intent
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
would it would it you know if we got to
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
work on this anyway
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
um would it make sense to change the
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
word from representing
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
to maybe something like comprised of or
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
consisting of and then if there actually
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed put licensed
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers
 
02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.710 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers
um

02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:44.790 --> 02:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
licensed educational specialists and
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
licensed instructional specialists just
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
to be very clear i think that would
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
certainly make it very clear okay thank
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
you and do they have to be employed can
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
they're licensed
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
well we have many retired folks who
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
maintain a license we have many
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
unemployed folks who maintain a license
 
02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
unemployed folks who maintain a license
so

02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
they could be retired and
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
so you have a license
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
i could be a member you could we would
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
welcome that even though i'm not
 
02:40:16.399 --> 02:40:17.429 align:start position:0%
welcome that even though i'm not
employed

02:40:17.429 --> 02:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
employed
 
02:40:17.439 --> 02:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
employed
yes

02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
i get a hundred dollars a year
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
not on the psp
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%

license and we have many individuals
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that you don't have
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers there
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
i am it's a real concern of mine and i'm
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
massage that particular
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
nine members
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh since we're already adding
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
instructional specialists to that to
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
representation or
 
02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:46.230 align:start position:0%
representation or
uh

02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
comprised of
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
has uh an adequate amount of of
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
licensed classroom teachers
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh yep thank you um
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
i share your concern but i can tell you
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter the hardest
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
category for us to recruit members to
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
the psb is from classroom teachers
 
02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.750 align:start position:0%
the psb is from classroom teachers
because

02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh typically for them to attend a
 
02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
meeting it entails them
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh their their principle replacing them
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
for the day in their classroom every
 
02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:19.110 align:start position:0%
for the day in their classroom every
month

02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we've heard that that is a real
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
block to many teachers wanting to serve
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
on the professional standards board
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
because a substitute teacher has to be
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
brought in to replace them for the day
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
is there any possibility to move the
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
meeting time so it doesn't require
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
during the day or
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
then we run into a problem with the cbas
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
talk to the retired teachers association
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay are there further questions
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
not seen thank you very much thank you
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other people who like to
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
speak on on this bill
 
02:42:58.479 --> 02:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
speak on on this bill
353

02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
353
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.120 --> 03:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much i think most of
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
the committee is is back
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%

most succinct uh testimony we've had
 
03:45:57.359 --> 03:45:58.389 align:start position:0%
most succinct uh testimony we've had
today

03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
i see no questions on that testimony so
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
i will call on our next guest
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
now it's on okay it's red
 
03:46:19.510 --> 03:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um we asked over the
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
summer a group of legislators to
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
submit this bill on behalf of the
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
because it's been a long-standing issue
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the department in 2013 the
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
department of education had an audit
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
from the lba relative to the adequate
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
education funding formula and they
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
identified a few errors or issues that
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
they found in the law that made the law
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
either confusing to implement or were
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
relatively unclear we at that time had
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
to uh amend the law and unfortunately
 
03:46:53.189 --> 03:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
that proposed legislation did not go
 
03:46:53.199 --> 03:46:54.150 align:start position:0%
that proposed legislation did not go
through

03:46:54.150 --> 03:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
we propose it again maybe in 2016 or 17
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
i forget which year and then again last
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
year we tried to attach it to a
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
different funding bill
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
and that different funding bill ended up
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
being itled so as a result of that the
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that we had tried to get
 
03:47:11.830 --> 03:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
through did not go through so here we
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
are almost 10 years later
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
still trying to get through some
 
03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislation mostly clarifying and adding
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
the word the or amounts and things like
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
that as a result of this lba audit
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
the most important thing for the
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee to understand relative to this
 
03:47:29.189 --> 03:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill is it does not change the
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
calculation of the formula at all and
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is probably the only time i've ever
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
seen a bill that has changes to that the
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
section of the law around the funding
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
formula that does not have a fiscal note
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we tried to work very hard on this
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure it didn't have a fiscal
 
03:47:44.479 --> 03:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
to make sure it didn't have a fiscal
note

03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
note
 
03:47:48.150 --> 03:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to make sure that this
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
would finally hopefully get through for
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department so we could
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
feel like we had complied with this
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
outstanding or long-standing lba audit
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
so i will take any questions from the
 
03:48:00.880 --> 03:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
so i will take any questions from the
committee

03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative baum
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
on on
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
page um three
 
03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
for on uh line 15
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
or that section b for the purpose of
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
calculating it's um shall count as an
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
additional 0.15 pupil and they're taking
 
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
the course now if they're taking
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
multiple courses is that 0.15 per cost
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes per course i also want to point out
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the way that the law works right
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
now is a school district only receives
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
adequate education funding for home
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
school kids taking courses if there's
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
excess appropriation in the state budget
 
03:48:47.670 --> 03:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
this book law was changed in maybe 2015
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
to include this language
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
however we've only paid home school
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
funding to school districts probably
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
three times in that time period
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
because those were the years that had
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
excess funding in the budget
 
03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
for homes in the adequacy formula but
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
this does not change the way that the
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
formula is calculated at all okay thank
 
03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:09.590 align:start position:0%
formula is calculated at all okay thank
you

03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so i'm the sub the newbie on
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
this committee so i don't know
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
everything everybody else does but what
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
is the definition of a chartered public
 
03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:19.189 align:start position:0%
is the definition of a chartered public
school

03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
so a chartered public school is a
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
school that has been authorized by the
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
either the state board of education
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
or a local school district to operate a
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
chartered public school there are
 
03:49:31.199 --> 03:49:32.389 align:start position:0%
chartered public school there are
some

03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
laws that require or that define what a
 
03:49:38.630 --> 03:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
charter school is and the various
 
03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
charter school is and the various
different

03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
different things that a school must do
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
to operate in compliance with the law
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
many of those many of those charter
 
03:49:49.990 --> 03:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire are operated by
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
organization a non-profit usually or
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually not usually always because it's
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
required in law for it to be a
 
03:49:57.359 --> 03:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
required in law for it to be a
non-profit

03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
are funded by the state of new hampshire
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's no tuition that are charged to
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
any schools or sorry to any parents that
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
are new hampshire residents for children
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
participating in those chart those
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
charter public schools it's actually
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
very common
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
confusion that charter schools charge
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
tuition but they do not for
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
participation for new hampshire resident
 
03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:21.590 align:start position:0%
participation for new hampshire resident
children

03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:23.030 align:start position:0%
children
so

03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm probably misreading this but i'm
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
looking at page
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
one i guess it is
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh line five and six
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it looks to me like you're expanding
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're expanding funding of kindergarten
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
to chartered schools in a way that's not
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
currently there
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
am i misreading that so the current law
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
for chartered public schools actually
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
reaches back to
 
03:50:48.640 --> 03:50:49.830 align:start position:0%
reaches back to
the

03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:52.150 --> 03:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
the traditional adequacy funding formula
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then there is um this section that
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
was not updated when the chart when full
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
day kindergarten went through
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
we have asked at the department several
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
times if the charter school
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
are eligible for full-day kindergarten
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
funding it was determined that this was
 
03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:07.590 align:start position:0%
funding it was determined that this was
um

03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:10.150 --> 03:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
always to include charter schools but
 
03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
this this right here was just not
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
updated in that section of the law
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
so that was that is the ongoing
 
03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that so do do
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners in a charter school
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
currently receive this funding yes the
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
department has been paying full-day
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
kindergarten funding for all
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
public school kids that were that attend
 
03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
full-day kindergarten the department has
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
been funding them at the full day
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay so there's so we we're not changing
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
the funding anywhere in any way anywhere
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill exactly
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
versus ellison
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you caitlin
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on page three
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh lines 13 and 14
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh it it talks about a charter
 
03:51:54.150 --> 03:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
conversion school yes
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
was this language involved included in
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
all previous requests
 
03:51:58.880 --> 03:51:59.830 align:start position:0%
all previous requests
for

03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
under this or just a new
 
03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
part of the request the charter school
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
conversion law currently exists um we
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
are just updating the words amounts and
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
annual amounts and what not in there
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
there are there is a other legislation
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
that is making its way through i believe
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
the house or the senate to change the
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
way that charter conversion schools work
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
but that is not reflected in this bill
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
so this does not change conversion
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
any further
 
03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
any further
questions

03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
um representative hopson
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
03:52:40.389 --> 03:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
question uh you had submitted a um a
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
formula sheet from the lba for uh at at
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
the beginning of my term on education
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes um and i understand that there's one
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
for charter schools as well i was
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could forward that of
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative vegas
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about the admr and
 
03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
why where and what for i just
 
03:53:12.150 --> 03:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
sure um so the formula right now is
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
calculated by admr um the formula the
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
way it works is we look at the number of
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids and so admr stands for average
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
daily membership and residence as
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to average daily membership and
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
attendance that's adma
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
and the thing that is confusing that i
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
want to point out to the committee is
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
that even though for adma the average
 
03:53:34.870 --> 03:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
daily membership in attendance uses the
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
word attendance it has nothing to do
 
03:53:39.429 --> 03:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
with the amount of time a child is
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
either absent or attending school so the
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
formula is not modified for a child
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
being absent 10 days of a year so we we
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
do not change the funding formula for
 
03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:51.189 align:start position:0%
do not change the funding formula for
that

03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
right now the formula uses the word adm
 
03:53:54.080 --> 03:53:55.670 align:start position:0%
right now the formula uses the word adm
a

03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
however then it goes on to talk about
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
calculating the kids in a resident town
 
03:54:02.950 --> 03:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the way that the formula works we
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
also then net any statewide education
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
property tax swept amount against
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education grants before we pay
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
the grants and we do actually make the
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
payment to the school district where the
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
child is attending however
 
03:54:22.150 --> 03:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
because of that swept piece and the we
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh we need to go back to the residential
 
03:54:26.469 --> 03:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
um side of the formula that's why we
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
need to do the initial calculation by
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
admr and then make the payment in line
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
with adma
 
03:54:34.630 --> 03:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
so this is how the department has been
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
paying the formula or calculating the
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
formula for
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
14 ish years now but
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of one of those things
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
where the math on the paper doesn't work
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you very much and now you
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the hearing on house bill
 
03:55:04.150 --> 03:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me senate bill 386
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
and we have about 15 minutes until our
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
the clock on the wall says 1 30 or
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
there abouts
 
04:10:05.600 --> 04:10:06.710 align:start position:0%

04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon for your consideration
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 410 which is relative to the
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
public comment periods at school
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
district meetings and the meetings of
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
has been changed from what i had
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
originally filed and i think as all of
 
04:11:07.110 --> 04:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
you probably know that tends to happen
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
during the legislative process
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
but the one part that was extremely
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
important to me was the part dealing
 
04:11:13.920 --> 04:11:15.269 align:start position:0%
important to me was the part dealing
with

04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
comment periods at school district
 
04:11:17.199 --> 04:11:18.309 align:start position:0%
comment periods at school district
meetings

04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we saw happening
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh this summer and i saw it in my own
 
04:11:22.720 --> 04:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
uh this summer and i saw it in my own
district

04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
um and that i really really became very
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about was the fact that
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
parents were not allowed to speak at
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
these public meetings of our school
 
04:11:33.840 --> 04:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
these public meetings of our school
board

04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly i think if they had
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
been allowed to speak to voice their
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
concerns to the school board
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
all the ensuing drama would not have
 
04:11:43.439 --> 04:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
all the ensuing drama would not have
happened

04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
i had been asked by a group of parents
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
to attend school at the uh our school
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
board meetings and i went to a couple
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
and i was really really surprised at
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
how dismissive the school board was
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
towards the parents
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
um i even witnessed a a a
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
school board member try to use 91a to
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
stop a parent from speaking
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i i became very very concerned at
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
that point because i knew it was a
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
misuse of the law
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
my other hat i wear i chair senate
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
judiciary and we tend to get all the 91a
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills so i'm pretty familiar with what
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
91a is and how it works
 
04:12:26.560 --> 04:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
91a is and how it works
but

04:12:27.670 --> 04:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
there just seemed to be a huge
 
04:12:29.359 --> 04:12:30.630 align:start position:0%
there just seemed to be a huge
disconnect

04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
between the school board members and the
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
parents and i tried to remind them that
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're not there to represent the
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
interest of the school
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
their job is to represent the parents
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
and how can you do that if you're not
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
even listening to the parents or even
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
giving them an opportunity to speak so
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the legislation was filed
 
04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:56.389 align:start position:0%
that's why the legislation was filed
um

04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think that we've we've learned a
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
couple of lessons from uh all the covid
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
procedures and policies that we've gone
 
04:13:03.680 --> 04:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
procedures and policies that we've gone
through

04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i think it's really great that
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
parents are really starting to pay
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
attention to what is going on in their
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
schools what are their children being
 
04:13:13.359 --> 04:13:14.630 align:start position:0%
schools what are their children being
taught

04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
taught
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we've got to try to strike a balance
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
because we can't in many ways stand in
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
the way of teachers and them doing their
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
job as well
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
so what i see this board what this bill
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
doing is really saying that they shall
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity for the public
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
to comment
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
and that it shall not be less than 30
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
minutes they can request that someone
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
register in advance but not require
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
pre-registration as a condition of
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
speaking because one of the things i
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
found out was that some school boards
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
say you have to sign up a few days ahead
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
of time and you have to tell them what
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
you want to speak about
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that that's appropriate
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
i feel that any parent any any taxpayer
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the community has the right to
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
address the school board over any issue
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
that they feel is appropriate
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's why you have these public
 
04:14:09.680 --> 04:14:11.189 align:start position:0%
that's why you have these public
meetings

04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
some other things happened in in my
 
04:14:13.279 --> 04:14:16.229 align:start position:0%
some other things happened in in my
community

04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittees were put together without
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
public notice
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
they were getting advice from this
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about covid protocols and
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
nobody knew who these people were
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
because they weren't even meeting in
 
04:14:28.720 --> 04:14:29.830 align:start position:0%
because they weren't even meeting in
public

04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
so it just got uglier and uglier and
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uglier and i really believe that if
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
they had a dialogue
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
that maybe a lot of this could have not
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
would not have happened but you've got
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
to give the parents and the taxpayers
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address the school
 
04:14:46.960 --> 04:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address the school
board

04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think we all know sometimes people say
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
things we don't like
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
but that's part of the job we're here to
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
listen just as they're here to listen to
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
the people so
 
04:14:59.279 --> 04:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
the people so
um

04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's again it goes on to say that
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section so restricts
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
school board from establishing other
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable standards for the common
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
public comment period
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
provided that such standards are imposed
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
equally on all speakers
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
so um that is the part that i can speak
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
to again the bill was changed i had two
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
other sections to the original bill
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
one dealt with school charters we do
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a few school districts that are
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
governed by charter and it doesn't there
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a way
 
04:15:35.279 --> 04:15:36.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a way
for

04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
um the charter to change and i speak to
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the town of londonderry where they the
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
last time that they really had the
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
charter open was in the late 1980s
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the parents were
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
complaining that why aren't we opening
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
the charter why aren't we talking about
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
some of these things
 
04:15:55.110 --> 04:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately senate education took
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
that one out and there was a section in
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
on ethics that would require school
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
boards to all have a code of ethics
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
i just think that when everybody knows
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
what the rules are everybody intends to
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
play a little better
 
04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so um this is this bill is an
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to get
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
school districts and parents talking to
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:23.110 --> 04:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh representative
 
04:16:23.120 --> 04:16:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh representative
hopson

04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
hopson
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you for
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator uh so i was
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
on the school board in my town for about
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
six years and i'm still not able to
 
04:16:34.560 --> 04:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
six years and i'm still not able to
articulate

04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
articulate
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
where the conversation the dialogue that
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned can actually happen i know
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that there is public comment
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
periods but at what point how would a
 
04:16:48.159 --> 04:16:49.269 align:start position:0%
periods but at what point how would a
parent

04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
or parents or even
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
audience members actually engage in a
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
dialogue back and forth when does that
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
happen and how can how can that happen
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it can
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
happen at every meeting
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
school board meetings publish an agenda
 
04:17:11.670 --> 04:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
and so any member of the public in that
 
04:17:14.070 --> 04:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
community can look to see what's on the
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
agenda and they might want to offer a
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
comment or they might want to offer what
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
they think
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
about what they're going to be talking
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
about so that's really where it starts
 
04:17:26.149 --> 04:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
is being open and being transparent
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
letting the parents know what's good
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be talking about
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
so if a parent chooses to they can
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
attend that meeting and by requiring
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
them to have at least 30 minutes
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
where they can
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
where the public can address them that's
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.159 --> 04:17:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
follow

04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
so specifically
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes parents would like to
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
get an answer to a question
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
and we hear that that's a meeting in
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
public versus a public meeting or or a
 
04:17:58.239 --> 04:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
public versus a public meeting or or a
non-meeting

04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
non-meeting
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
how do we get
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
the responses back is that a special
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
meeting or a hearing
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
i know thank you again for the question
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's really kind of interesting for
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
me because if
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
we've we elect these school board
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
members they're there to to do a job and
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
if a member of the public comes to them
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
and asks a question they should be able
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
why if you unless you you're asking for
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
something very specific where they have
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
to go and look for it that's a different
 
04:18:34.319 --> 04:18:35.189 align:start position:0%
to go and look for it that's a different
issue

04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
but they can't say look i don't have
 
04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
that information i will get back to you
 
04:18:41.110 --> 04:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
leave your name and your telephone
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
number your address and we'll get that
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
information and we'll send it to you
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why you can't give
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
information it doesn't doesn't have to
 
04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
be necessarily at a meeting what it is
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
is saying the parents have the right to
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
come here and they have a right to ask
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions i know at our school board
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
meeting we have both our superintendent
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
our vice superintendent we have our
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
finance director and the attorney
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
between all of them they should be able
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
to answer a question
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ellison
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator for
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh i generally
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
support the bit the the bill is written
 
04:19:21.040 --> 04:19:22.229 align:start position:0%
support the bit the the bill is written
uh

04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
interested in your comment
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
or comments on
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
the 30 minutes i mean i'm just let's
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically and this happens in a
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
school board meetings you set a
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
30-minute limit and you say there are 10
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
people and you know ahead of time or at
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
least 10 people want to speak you give
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
everybody three minutes
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
one of the observations i have of the
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
school board meetings in the last year
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
is people wanted to speak as long as
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to speak and three minutes
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
would not be sufficient
 
04:19:52.399 --> 04:19:53.429 align:start position:0%
would not be sufficient
uh

04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:55.110 --> 04:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
it may well have been two hours would
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
not be sufficient
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
how do you deal
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
under this set of circumstances with
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of frustration which is i have
 
04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
a right to talk to the board as long as
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
i want to talk to the board and you
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
cannot limit the amount of time that i
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
have to ask questions or whatever
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we're talking
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
about having an opportunity to speak
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is going to be
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
the purview of the chair to decide what
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
those parameters are so if you have
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
10 people show up they're going to speak
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
and tell and you tell them right from
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
the very beginning
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people that would like
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to treat everyone the same
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to get three minutes
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that's it we do that here when we
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
get huge public hearings where we have
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
to go over to uh rep's hall because
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
we've got so many people and oftentimes
 
04:20:48.790 --> 04:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
we will put people
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
on a timer and we'll say we want to get
 
04:20:53.110 --> 04:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
through everyone we want to hear from
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
everyone so we're gonna
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a three minute time limit
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
you can you know please talk to us don't
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
read whatever if you've got something
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
that you've written down don't read it
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
um please try to paraphrase or we will
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
ask well okay we're going to do the
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes please don't repeat what
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
other people have said
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it works and i mean but i mean again
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's the purview of the chair i don't
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
want the state micromanaging school
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
boards either and telling them this this
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
and this we have 30 minutes
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you know a chair of a
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee will schedule a public hearing
 
04:21:29.920 --> 04:21:30.710 align:start position:0%
committee will schedule a public hearing
for

04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
a half an hour and sometimes it might
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
take 15 minutes sometimes it's two hours
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
later it's kind of difficult to judge
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
how long someone is going how many
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to show up
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
and so just 30 minutes gives them an
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to come in and
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
talk if they want to it's up to the
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
chair to put those parameters around
 
04:21:52.000 --> 04:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
chair to put those parameters around
them

04:21:53.110 --> 04:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%

carson

04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
carson
 
04:22:00.080 --> 04:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
carson
um

04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
one of the problems i see with this it
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't say when
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
i know in our school board meeting it's
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
you can there's a
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
commit i mean people can talk at the
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
beginning and at the end and i've known
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
some school boards and i've seen press
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
on it only say you can do the couple
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
public comments at the end of their
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
meeting which could be midnight
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't be be
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
a comment i mean in your legislation
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
here that at the beginning
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the school board
 
04:22:33.120 --> 04:22:34.229 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the school board
meeting

04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um in the
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
original language it was 30 minutes at
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the hearing
 
04:22:39.840 --> 04:22:40.790 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the hearing
um

04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
but again there are some districts that
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
will allow comment at the end as well
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:22:48.880 --> 04:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
right so
again

04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
we i guess they're trying not to
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
micromanage and just say
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
30 minutes and leave it up to the chair
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
to decide if it's at the beginning or at
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
the end
 
04:23:01.110 --> 04:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
but if this committee
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to change that then
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's the purview of this committee
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
yeah because one of the comments that
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
i've heard from other school boards or
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
people complaining about them yeah
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
they'll do the 30 minutes or comments at
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the meeting which means
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be midnight you know that
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
i mean so it's a way of not allowing
 
04:23:19.920 --> 04:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
i mean so it's a way of not allowing
comments

04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
question um it says public comment
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
period shall be no less than 30 minutes
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
i attended hundreds of school board
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
meetings and there was no public comment
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
does that mean they have to set it and
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
sit and wait 30 minutes
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
if there's you know if they have to keep
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
it open as a public comment or if
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's no one there or one comment and
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
move on
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
um again it thank you for the question
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative it is saying no less than
 
04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
30 minutes so it will be a 30 minute
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
block of time that will be available to
 
04:24:01.110 --> 04:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the public should they choose to address
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
04:24:02.399 --> 04:24:03.429 align:start position:0%
the school board
um

04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:03.439 --> 04:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
um
it's

04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are there are going to be people
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be time when you're
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot of people they're
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to be times when nobody shows up
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
but i truly believe that
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
that time should be set aside
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the public to come in if if they
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.840 --> 04:24:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
waltz i'm on the same line and that is
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know you've got large communities in
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
your district where you're likely to get
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
a large turnout
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'm in the same district as
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative holland one of our
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
communities is only about 2 000 people
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
and if we have to set aside 30 minutes
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
one person shows up
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
do they get to monopolize that 30
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
minutes does the board have to sit and
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
listen to them for a full 30 minutes or
 
04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
can they can we amend this and say 30
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
minutes unless there's fewer than three
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
people there so that we're only really
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe somebody
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i could see in a small town
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
you've got some
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
maverick who shows up every single week
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
takes it 30 minutes and monopolizes it
 
04:25:06.070 --> 04:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
for 30 minutes every single week the
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
board sits there and listens to them and
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else bothers to show up that to
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
me is almost abusive of the process and
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the board so i'm trying to figure out
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
how this would work in small communities
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
again i i don't i speak to not
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
micromanaging and it's going to be the
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
purview of the chair how to manage that
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
30 minutes
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they want to allow someone to speak
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
for 30 minutes
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's their decision
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine that a lot of school
 
04:25:37.840 --> 04:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine that a lot of school
board

04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
chairs wouldn't allow something like
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
that and would put some sort of
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
parameter around it so you don't have
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
one person
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
dominating the whole process but again i
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see a way how we can
 
04:25:50.560 --> 04:25:51.429 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see a way how we can
um

04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
do something like that because you might
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
have someone who's you know i want to go
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
to the school board meeting tonight i
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
want to get up there and i want to talk
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
about this particular issue i'm on my
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
way home from work i'm running late i
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
got you know if they're gonna shut it
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
off say at 7 30 and i walk in the door
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
at 7 25 and find out well we didn't we
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
had one person here and they spoke and
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
that was it your opportunity to speak is
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
now gone so by leaving it open and
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
letting the chair decide how they want
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
to manage that time i think is the
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to go
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow-up
 
04:26:29.110 --> 04:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard as it is to get people
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
to volunteer for these spots and we've
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
had a lot of elections in our
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
communities that were unopposed because
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
you can barely get enough people to run
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
if you're expecting school board members
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
to basically have to sit there an extra
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
half hour even if nobody's showing up
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't you think that's going to even
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
make it harder to convince people that
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
want to serve on boards these days when
 
04:26:53.110 --> 04:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
these meetings are automatically a half
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
hour longer even if nobody shows up to
 
04:26:55.359 --> 04:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
hour longer even if nobody shows up to
testify

04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
these are also elected officials
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
they ran for office nobody forced
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
anybody to do anything
 
04:27:05.199 --> 04:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
anybody to do anything
they

04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
chose to run for office
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
and i think every single person in this
 
04:27:12.630 --> 04:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
room knows that there are times where it
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
is difficult serving the people
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
because of the time demands on all of us
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
but we know what we sign up for
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and part of our job and a big part of
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
our job is to listen to the people to
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
listen to our constituents the people
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
that put us here
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly if you don't have 30
 
04:27:35.429 --> 04:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
minutes to listen to people maybe some
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
people should really rethink whether or
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
not they should be in be running for
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
office we need dedicated individuals and
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't care what party they belong to
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
because school boards are non-partisan
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
who care about our kids and who want to
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
work with parents
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
to better their children's education and
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
if they can't spare an extra 30 minutes
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
of their time then maybe they should
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
think about running for something else
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator um
 
04:28:07.359 --> 04:28:08.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator um
so

04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
i also have served on the school board
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
we always had a
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
public comment section at the beginning
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the meeting a public comment section
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
at the end of the meeting and we limited
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
it to five minutes per person so
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes we could be there for quite a
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
long time if it was a long
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
large number of people and sometimes
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
there was nobody to speak at all
 
04:28:31.110 --> 04:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
would you consider or would you be
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
amenable to some sort of language in
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill that allows the school board
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
to continue with its business
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
if there's no public comment um no one
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
available for public comment
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then if someone shows up they could
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
allow that public comment because to be
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
honest there were meetings when we were
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
done in 45 minutes i mean we and
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes we are elected officials but we are
 
04:28:58.880 --> 04:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
yes we are elected officials but we are
volunteers

04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to find those volunteers
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
it just seems like it would it's a
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
little bit too you have to sit there for
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
30 minutes even though there's no one
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak to you
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
um because somebody might show up
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
at you know at the end of the time that
 
04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
wants to speak to you
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
seems to put
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
to not be a fish efficient use of
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's precious evening
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
time that they have so i'm just
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you'd be amenable to some
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
kind of language that would allow for
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility with the board if no one is
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
there to speak
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative quite frankly
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is in the hands of this
 
04:29:40.239 --> 04:29:41.269 align:start position:0%
this bill is in the hands of this
committee

04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
and this committee is going to amend it
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
however they see fit
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
i i i'm one of those folks that i filed
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
the legislation but once it gets filed
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
and assigned to a committee
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
this i'm the sponsor of it but it
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
belongs to the committee so you folks
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
today are going to hear the le here
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh the testimony you're going to
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
deliberate and you're going to make the
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
changes that you feel are appropriate
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative luno no good
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
representation okay representative lakis
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
um i notice it
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
it talks about public comment period and
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
at our school board meeting
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
i heard parents go in to ask questions
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
of the school board and they were told
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is a public comment time you can
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
make comments we're not here to answer
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
question because i heard the same thing
 
04:30:36.239 --> 04:30:37.189 align:start position:0%
question because i heard the same thing
too

04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
and again this is
 
04:30:41.349 --> 04:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there's going to be
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
an easy answer to this because you're
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with the makeup of boards and
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
the personality of the individuals that
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
are serving on these boards
 
04:30:53.110 --> 04:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
and i i strongly believe myself
 
04:30:53.120 --> 04:30:54.389 align:start position:0%
and i i strongly believe myself
that

04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
these are elected individuals
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
they they are there to represent the
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
people that means listening to the
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
people engaging with the people if the
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
people have a question
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
that question needs to get answered
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
and if it gets answered during a public
 
04:31:10.159 --> 04:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
and if it gets answered during a public
comment

04:31:11.110 --> 04:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
session great
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
if they have a mechanism that you can
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
submit questions online to the school
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
board and we'll answer your questions
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's great too but i just don't want
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
to micromanage this whole process but i
 
04:31:26.309 --> 04:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
realized this is a problem it's a
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
problem that got revealed during covid
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
because of kids not physically being in
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
school parents were home they were
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
watching what their kids were doing and
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
they started to get upset at what they
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
were seeing and they wanted to engage
 
04:31:43.269 --> 04:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
with their school board that is a local
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
elected body
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
and they found way too many impediments
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
in order to do that
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so many parents have stayed very
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
engaged you're talking about their
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
children in their children's future
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
and they're very very concerned about
 
04:31:59.920 --> 04:32:00.950 align:start position:0%
and they're very very concerned about
that

04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:00.960 --> 04:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
that
so

04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
you've got to try to balance that
 
04:32:07.210 --> 04:32:07.220 align:start position:0%
against people who volunteer
 
04:32:07.220 --> 04:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
against people who volunteer
[Music]

04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then getting the business done and
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
listening to the people
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
i think we all know that's not really an
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
easy balance but we figure it out and i
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
think that they'll be able to figure it
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
out as well
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
president moffatt
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thank you senator for
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
being here and as representative ellis
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
said i think i understand the intent and
 
04:32:28.479 --> 04:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
said i think i understand the intent and
and

04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
also generally supportive
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
leading to my question i'll point out
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
that the bill before this one had a half
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
hour block scheduled for it we only use
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
15 minutes and
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i agree uh that a
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
a good chair can manage that time and
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not particularly worried about
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios about you know who might show
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
up or who might it's something as you
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
said the chair could manage my question
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
it has to do with what constitutes the
 
04:32:55.279 --> 04:32:56.309 align:start position:0%
it has to do with what constitutes the
public

04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think i i think that many of us are
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
kind of assuming that those are the town
 
04:33:03.510 --> 04:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
folk and the citizens of the town but
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes educators who work at the
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
school live outside the town limits some
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders don't live in the within
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
the town and my question is what if
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
there are some uh
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
activists or
 
04:33:19.199 --> 04:33:21.029 align:start position:0%
activists or
non-residents

04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
non-residents
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
who are they part of the public can they
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
come in and can they have some of this
 
04:33:25.359 --> 04:33:26.310 align:start position:0%
come in and can they have some of this
time

04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question um
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
again i see this as a management done by
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
that you would have individuals from
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
your community
 
04:33:36.160 --> 04:33:36.949 align:start position:0%
your community
that

04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to speak that they very
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
well could speak and it would be up to
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
the chair whether or not they wanted to
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
allow people who are activists from
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
other communities to speak again it's
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
their time and they need to micro that
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
we don't need to micromanage their time
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
they get to manage their time if they
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
wish to allow people from who do not
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
live in their community to speak
 
04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to be up to the chair
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:34:10.320 --> 04:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for bringing forth
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
i had sat on two school boards during
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
all of covid and it and it was rough and
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
i think part of why the people were so
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
angry was because they weren't being
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
heard for so long
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
i understand the bill is in our hands
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
now but i want to ask you and respect
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
you and your wishes as a sponsor
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we if we consider
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
changing the verbiage of public comment
 
04:34:34.160 --> 04:34:34.869 align:start position:0%
changing the verbiage of public comment
to

04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
even public exchange or something but we
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
go through a list of synonyms of
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
something that may be a little bit more
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate than public comment
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from with
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
a specific amount of time i completely
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
get that but i am i do think there are
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
times when we would sit there doing
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
nothing i'm wondering um
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
if we did just put back public exchange
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and the end of the
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
meeting but without a time limit
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative as i've as i've said the
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill is now in your hands and your
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
committee is going to do with the bill
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman are there any
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question senator
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
i see both sides of this i wouldn't want
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
to sit there for 30 minutes is there
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
some way of warding this so that there's
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
a 30 minutes slot say from 7 to 7 30
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
people can come and talk but if they're
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
not there you can conduct regular
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
business i don't know how you'd word
 
04:35:47.520 --> 04:35:48.551 align:start position:0%
business i don't know how you'd word
that

04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden you're 10 minutes
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
into the meeting
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
they would be able to talk if there's
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
nobody there you can run the meeting and
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
at 7 30
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
you're too late
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
04:36:00.799 --> 04:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
um

04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative nelson i have every
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
confidence in your chair who is well
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
known as being a wonderful wordsmith to
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
try and figure out how to get that done
 
04:36:14.300 --> 04:36:14.310 align:start position:0%
go downstairs and tell senator ward that
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:16.551 align:start position:0%
go downstairs and tell senator ward that
[Laughter]

04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook i'm off the hook see
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
i understand this whole 30 minutes
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
because we in the senate we usually
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
schedule our meetings 15 minutes apart
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're like it's an hour
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
maybe two hours later you know we run
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
behind and look i get it but a chair
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
knows how to manage that time so again
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much this afternoon
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be back and house
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
education senate uh ed does it in 10
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
minutes for each bill
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
well they try
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
well there's a reason why senator ward
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah what we're going to do because
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has to go
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
downstairs to testify down there with
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
sena i'm going to have him testify next
 
04:37:21.429 --> 04:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
how come you put down 30 minutes on your
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
part of that is explained in my
 
04:37:48.080 --> 04:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
part of that is explained in my
amendment

04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
you're mike
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
i would think i would know
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
um glenn cordelli representing
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
tuftonboro moultonborough and sandwiched
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the beautiful lakes region
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
and um i agree with
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of what senator carson had just
 
04:38:14.639 --> 04:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
a lot of what senator carson had just
said

04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
in looking at the legislation
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
this weekend
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
i had a
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted which is being passed
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
around now
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
um i think it
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
does address some of the comments um and
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
questions we just heard
 
04:38:32.879 --> 04:38:33.670 align:start position:0%
questions we just heard
um

04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i'll
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
on second or third line
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
it removes
 
04:38:47.760 --> 04:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
it removes
the

04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
language that a public comment period
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
shall be heard for no less than 30
 
04:38:52.480 --> 04:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
shall be heard for no less than 30
minutes

04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
and instead
 
04:38:55.600 --> 04:38:56.390 align:start position:0%
and instead
says

04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
the public comment periods shall be
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
provided for public input for agenda
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
items before board action is taken and
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
shall also be provided for non-agenda
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
items of community interest
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
each public comment period shall be for
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
no less than 30 minutes unless comments
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
are completed earlier
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
which i think hopefully addresses the
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
30-minute requirement
 
04:39:23.349 --> 04:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
but also i think it's very very
 
04:39:23.359 --> 04:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
but also i think it's very very
important

04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
that the public has the ability to
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
agenda items before the board takes
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
action very often we've seen
 
04:39:34.480 --> 04:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
action very often we've seen
um

04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
with comment periods at the end of the
 
04:39:37.280 --> 04:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
with comment periods at the end of the
meeting

04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
someone might want to speak on something
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
that the board is discussing or voting
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
on and because the comment period is the
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
end of the meeting the board has already
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
taken action without any input from the
 
04:39:48.480 --> 04:39:49.430 align:start position:0%
taken action without any input from the
public

04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the main things i
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to address
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
in this uh amendment
 
04:39:59.910 --> 04:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
and in addition um it removes uh section
 
04:39:59.920 --> 04:40:00.788 align:start position:0%
and in addition um it removes uh section
two

04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill as presented to us
 
04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
involving the state board of education
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
public comment period
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'll leave that to the
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i see the chairman is here um uh
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and will be testifying um but i've seen
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
many um
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
state board meeting where they've gone
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
on for a considerable length of time
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
with public comment
 
04:40:31.110 --> 04:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
probably for
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
longer than they would have uh planned
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
or liked
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
the same as we do
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
so i i think that this bill should focus
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
on local school boards and public
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
comment periods and allowing the public
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
to provide input
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
and not
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from commenting on things
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
that might be interest
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
of interest to them
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
and to the community thus the both the
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
agenda items and non-agenda items uh
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
provided for in the amendment
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
and with that i i thank you thank you
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions questions
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't want to hold you up thank you
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
my question just quickly is with both
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
what the senator presented and what you
 
04:41:26.718 --> 04:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
what the senator presented and what you
presented

04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
presented
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
why is it that um school boards may
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
request persons register in advance of
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
what would be the purpose or what would
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
that accomplish
 
04:41:37.680 --> 04:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
that accomplish
um

04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
i i did not strike that from the bill um
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
but uh i um
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
personally would not be in in favor of
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
requiring pre-registration
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
i i personally would
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
that it may school boards may request
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
that person's register advance to the
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
meeting i don't even not even
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that if you if you were
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
the committee wanted to strike that i i
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
would have no
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
objection for the comments yes
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
do you think signing register before the
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
meeting can just mean signing up before
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting starts so that they can call
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
people in the order in which they signed
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
up so that if they got there early and
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
signed up they could go first rather
 
04:42:22.878 --> 04:42:23.590 align:start position:0%
signed up they could go first rather
than

04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
wait till so that it's not random it's
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
just sure because i think manchester
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
does they just
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
sign up as they get there so that they
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
have the order to call them in sort of
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
like we do with our pink cards
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
my name is representative tom dolan i am
 
04:42:59.920 --> 04:43:02.708 align:start position:0%
my name is representative tom dolan i am
the

04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
chair of the municipal and county
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee in the house
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i've just finished
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
seven terms as the
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
town councilor in londonderry so
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
last month was my last time on the
 
04:43:17.760 --> 04:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
last month was my last time on the
committee

04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
the bill that i wrote
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
is not in front of you so i apologize
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
for that but i just want to talk to you
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
about the spirit of it and what you
 
04:43:29.520 --> 04:43:30.310 align:start position:0%
about the spirit of it and what you
might

04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
be able to do with it i wrote uh house
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill 1195
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
which was very short
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
and uh to the point
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh and it was in response to what i was
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
observing and and
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
members of the uh
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
of the various boards we're observing is
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
that across our communities
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
the unevenness of public comment
 
04:43:57.030 --> 04:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh how it's being
 
04:43:57.040 --> 04:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
and uh how it's being
run

04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
run
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh in some some cases there were towns
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
or communities that didn't allow any
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
public comment or or
 
04:44:04.638 --> 04:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
public comment or or
uh

04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the school board
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
scenario they'd show up
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
and the response they would get i'm
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
sorry you're not on the agenda you're
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
not going to get any public comment
 
04:44:16.000 --> 04:44:17.910 align:start position:0%
not going to get any public comment
and

04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
then there are
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
some communities that i'll say
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
use a little mischief with public
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
comment and what do i mean by that there
 
04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
are communities that
 
04:44:28.480 --> 04:44:29.990 align:start position:0%
are communities that
will

04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
state they're going to have public
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
comment but they'll hold that public
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
comment until uh
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 or 11 o'clock at night
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i asked and i even queried about
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
what you know why are you holding public
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
comments so late well
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe these folks were going to go home
 
04:44:49.110 --> 04:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be done with it
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
so to me that's that's being mischievous
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
and that's not the spirit of being open
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
to the public and and get
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting that comment that can can help
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
run a better government
 
04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
so my my bill was much less specific
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
than what you have in front of you
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
and it basically said if you're going to
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
run a public meeting
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
you had to have a period of public
 
04:45:12.080 --> 04:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
you had to have a period of public
comment

04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
and there were some things about how
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
long and all that stuff and that can be
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
worked out but that's basically it
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
because if you if this passes great i
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
like what senator carson wrote you're
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to hear from the
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
from the department of uh
 
04:45:27.200 --> 04:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
from the department of uh
education

04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
association i'm sorry uh soon which i
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
like what what they've put out because
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
they talk about
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
privacy rules around
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
students information and so forth and
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's important i didn't include that
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
in my bill but that's important
 
04:45:44.878 --> 04:45:46.310 align:start position:0%
in my bill but that's important
but

04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
the the issue that that i'm working is
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
broadly across all
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
public boards
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the municipality
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
why should this only affect school
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
boards what about the planning board
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
what about the conservation commission
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
why should they not have public comment
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
an area of
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
development in an area that includes
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
wetlands when you want and if you're
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
close to those wetlands wetlands and you
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to come forth and give some comment
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
you'd want to do that probably at a
 
04:46:24.320 --> 04:46:25.590 align:start position:0%
you'd want to do that probably at a
conservation

04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
but if there's no public comment then
 
04:46:32.550 --> 04:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
you might not get in to get in
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to speak
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
so uh my suggestion is for the committee
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
is to consider what you have in front of
 
04:46:40.000 --> 04:46:40.708 align:start position:0%
is to consider what you have in front of
you

04:46:40.708 --> 04:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
consider uh hb 1195 as well and perhaps
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
put together a uh i i'm admits to saying
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
a study commission but put together a
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
group maybe a committee of conference
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
that could
 
04:46:56.550 --> 04:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at all these different
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
inputs that you've got and uh come up
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
with with something that works for
 
04:47:00.320 --> 04:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
with with something that works for
everybody

04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
i think that's the appropriate way i
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
think that just focusing on school
 
04:47:06.400 --> 04:47:07.350 align:start position:0%
think that just focusing on school
boards

04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:47:07.360 --> 04:47:08.150 align:start position:0%
boards
does

04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
address the issue that's been in the
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
news this past six months about crt and
 
04:47:13.280 --> 04:47:14.628 align:start position:0%
news this past six months about crt and
about

04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
school boards not not addressing it i
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
mean that that's
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to go away uh eventually
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about how do we run the
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
state how do we run our public meetings
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to get done with this
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
folks at home say that's great we got
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
the school board squared away now let's
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
take let's take all these other meetings
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
one at a time and there's only 19 of
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
them so we can have 19 bills that will
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
affect all of them
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
so so i would suggest you you broaden
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
your scope
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
and include all those other public
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
meetings where public comment is so
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
important for the dialogue between our
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
elected officials and the public to get
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
that dialogue completed and
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative boom
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you chairman
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
and i had the member of the town council
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
in londonderry did you have a comment
 
04:48:16.390 --> 04:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
period before and after or at any time
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah council meetings thank you
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the comment question we had for
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the town council
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
was uh typically
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
15 minutes
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it started right at the beginning of
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
and the chairman would ask for public
 
04:48:31.360 --> 04:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
and the chairman would ask for public
comment

04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
and if there was public comment he would
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
manage it whether it be the next 15
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
minutes or the next 30 minutes it would
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
be up to him to manage that and if there
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
was no public comment because that
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's come up excuse me that's come up
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
here what do we do with those extra 30
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
minutes if there was no public comment
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that he would close
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
public comment it wouldn't make people
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
sit there and look at their watch he
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
would close it so there's a way to
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
manage that and and at the school board
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
because this happens to talk a lot about
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
school boards the school board didn't
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
always have public comment they're
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
having it now mainly because we've
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
kind of escalated in the town uh
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue about how important it is but
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%

senate bill 410 i'll give you a little
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
bit of the background as to as to how we

got they got here
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
um so initially um house bill 1195 was
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
heard across the hall um in senator
 
04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me in house judiciary um i
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
haven't gone back and looked at my notes
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if nhsba took a position on
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
um but um uh
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
the house judiciary um made an amendment
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
i believe it was offered by um chairman
 
04:50:27.440 --> 04:50:28.788 align:start position:0%
i believe it was offered by um chairman
gordon

04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
gordon
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
which is the the iteration of house bill
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
1195 um that the committee is hearing
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
um uh and which i just passed around um
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh is so you have to so you can compare
 
04:50:43.990 --> 04:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
and contrast house bill um 1195 and i'll
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
get to 410 in a minute so that passed
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
out of um uh house judiciary passed the
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
full house that was just heard in
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
senate ed at one o'clock
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
in the meantime
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
senator carson introduced senate bill
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
410 and i have it here as introduced
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
every public comment meeting by hell
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
every public every public meeting held
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
by a school board shall include a period
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%

04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed and shall comply with
 
04:51:11.760 --> 04:51:12.830 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed and shall comply with
rsa

04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%

04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
91a period of public comments shall be
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
30 minutes of length and shall be held
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the meeting of the
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
first order of business some other
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
language in there and then it also
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
included a school board code of ethics i
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
think we've had a couple bills this
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
session that have spoken about a school
 
04:51:28.320 --> 04:51:29.190 align:start position:0%
session that have spoken about a school
board

04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
code of ethics
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
so nhsba opposed senate bill 410. um i
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
know how this works though and i know
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
that um with um
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
1195 crossing over
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
into the the senate and it being
 
04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
senator carson's um bill 410 i know
 
04:51:50.550 --> 04:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
shares have some influence over their
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
committees and perhaps some influence
 
04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
over the legislation that's before them
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
so um i fully anticipated and that
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
we would have a bill we meaning the
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
legislature would adopt a bill relative
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
to public comments at school board
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
meetings so with that in mind um the
 
04:52:08.550 --> 04:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
version of senate bill 410 that you see
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
before you is nhsba's language i drafted
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
it we had a good conversation in um in
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
senate ed and this is this is what came
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
out um to a couple of the comments um uh
 
04:52:23.190 --> 04:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the questions that were raised
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
um um
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
30 minutes i mean you know i don't know
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
i guess the bigger question is we've had
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
some questions or comments about should
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
that be held at the beginning of the of
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
the meeting i would nhsb would not
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
object to that we can pull language from
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
410 as introduced
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
it says the period for public comment
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
shall be a minimum of 30 minutes in
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
length and shall be held at the
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of the meeting as the first
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
order of business there'd be no
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
objection if we put that language back
 
04:52:51.920 --> 04:52:52.708 align:start position:0%
objection if we put that language back
in

04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:52:52.718 --> 04:52:54.550 align:start position:0%
in
um

04:52:54.550 --> 04:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:54.560 --> 04:52:56.868 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
the questions about you know if nobody
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
shows up
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
and you know what do you do does the
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
board have to sit there and and and wait
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the 30 minutes i don't know um you
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
know representative nelson you said i
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
don't know how we put that language in
 
04:53:10.470 --> 04:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
law i don't either i don't know how you
 
04:53:10.480 --> 04:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
law i don't either i don't know how you
could

04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
craft something reasonable that made
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
sense um i would hope at that point you
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
know maybe
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
some common sense would take over and if
 
04:53:18.798 --> 04:53:19.590 align:start position:0%
some common sense would take over and if
you're

04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
15 minutes into the meeting and somebody
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
ran late for whatever reason weren't
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
kids this that or the other thing you
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
know presuming there aren't a hundred
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
people lined up you know if you could
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
get the chair's attention and say mr
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
chair madam chair i came late would it
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
be possible if i spoke for three minutes
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
on on you know this issue or or whatnot
 
04:53:37.360 --> 04:53:38.550 align:start position:0%
on on you know this issue or or whatnot
um

04:53:38.550 --> 04:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
so you know i hope that would leave some
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the concerns if we just said at least
 
04:53:42.628 --> 04:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to put it in the in the
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh we had a question a representative
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
moffett i believe it was you
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
um that said about non-residents are
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
they allowed to speak um i
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm aware of i think at least one
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
school board in new hampshire
 
04:54:01.680 --> 04:54:02.868 align:start position:0%
school board in new hampshire
that

04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:04.470 --> 04:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they disallow
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
non-residents but they give preference
 
04:54:07.760 --> 04:54:08.550 align:start position:0%
non-residents but they give preference
to

04:54:08.550 --> 04:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
residents and or people who have a
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
direct interest in the school district
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
the teacher may live out of the
 
04:54:13.440 --> 04:54:14.948 align:start position:0%
the teacher may live out of the
community

04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
they've crafted i haven't i know they
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
were working on it i have to go back and
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
see what that board may have enacted um
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know i've done a little bit of
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
research on the first amendment
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
parameters of that and yes you are
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
allowed to um exclude non-residents and
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest with you
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
so some of many of the disruptions that
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
we saw at school board meetings last
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
summer and last fall they were from
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
people who did not live in that
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
community didn't have kids that went to
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
school in that community crafting that
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
sort of policy is a little challenge
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
because it's not just the non-residents
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
you have to be mindful of um with our
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
communities that do tuition agreements
 
04:54:50.550 --> 04:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
right so you know
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
it can be done but it could be a
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
challenge but you know you're obviously
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
going to want to let those parents
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
parents speak even though they may not
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
be residents
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
um representative litchfield about the
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
exchange and representative hodgson
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
about the communications and dialogue
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
between the board um and members of the
 
04:55:06.718 --> 04:55:08.470 align:start position:0%
between the board um and members of the
public

04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know in exchange could a board do
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
that possibly but
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
that 30 minutes is going to turn into
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
three hours real quick you know my my my
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
simple answer is you know if you have a
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
question and it's not being answered at
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
the meeting call your superintendent or
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
your board chair the next day if you
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
want to have a dialogue
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know where people can just come and
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
speak if you will you know nhsb was
 
04:55:32.470 --> 04:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
recommending when boards were
 
04:55:34.390 --> 04:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
considering the masking issue last
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
summer don't put that on your regular
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
school board meeting maybe have two
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
hours tonight we're only talking about
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
masks tonight we're only talking about
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
our our return to school plan it's an
 
04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
extra meeting it is what it is but you
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
know if we're getting if we're going to
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
start engaging in a dialogue back and
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
forth or an exchange
 
04:55:54.550 --> 04:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
the the 30 i mean if you're limited to
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
three or five minutes per person that's
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to be gone before you know it you
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
know and then you're only allowing six
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
people to talk if it's limited to 30
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
minutes that would be though be some of
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
my concerns with with that um i have not
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
seen representative cordelie's amendment
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
um it removes the 30 minutes
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
um public input for agenda items and
 
04:56:17.430 --> 04:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items i think if we maybe did
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
language that said the 30 minutes is at
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the meeting that may
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of those concerns but i
 
04:56:25.270 --> 04:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
mean if you wanted to do some boards do
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
do a second one you know first one
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
agenda items the back side you know
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
either what's on your mind or a recap of
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
what we discussed at that meeting again
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the amendment
 
04:56:35.360 --> 04:56:40.150 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the amendment
um

04:56:40.150 --> 04:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative lichfield you asked about
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
the pre-registration language and why is
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
that in there
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
senator carson's bill
 
04:56:50.708 --> 04:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
as introduced not the current version of
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
410 it says the school board shall not
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
require people who want to speak during
 
04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
the public comment period to register or
 
04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
sign in more than two hours in advance
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
of the meeting the school board may give
 
04:57:01.360 --> 04:57:02.788 align:start position:0%
of the meeting the school board may give
preference

04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
preference
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
in speaking to parents of children in
 
04:57:06.550 --> 04:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
the district or other persons who live
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the district so
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
wanting to try and address senator
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
carson's language in the original bill
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's why that language now exists in
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
in the version before you that's what
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's the genesis of that
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so you know i i i did then last i
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
mean to to to to representative dolan's
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know comments i think one of one of
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
the other bills that we had in this
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
committee this session i forget what one
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think talked about a public comment
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
period for for school boards and i said
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
look if you're going to put that in the
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
right to know law it's got to apply to
 
04:57:40.948 --> 04:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
every public body town council city
 
04:57:40.958 --> 04:57:42.230 align:start position:0%
every public body town council city
council

04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
council
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
village districts the water commission
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's a different issue
 
04:57:48.000 --> 04:57:49.350 align:start position:0%
i think that's a different issue
altogether

04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
but again so you know seeing the writing
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
on the wall and recognizing that we were
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to get something about
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
school board meeting uh public public
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
comments at school board meetings nhsba
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
worked with senate education the
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
language that you see before you is
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
language i drafted if there's room for
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendments or you would like an
 
04:58:07.600 --> 04:58:08.628 align:start position:0%
amendments or you would like an
amendment

04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:58:10.470 --> 04:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
let me know i'm happy to happy to work
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
with the committee to to smooth it out
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
i think by and large as as written i
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully alleviate some of the concerns
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we heard both in this committee and
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
in senate education as well and um i'm
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much barrett uh
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i think you
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
take my question wouldn't you agree that
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
as a former member of the school board
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes questions can't be answered
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
and should be referred to maybe another
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
agenda item
 
04:58:40.160 --> 04:58:41.030 align:start position:0%
agenda item
and

04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
so we agree
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know at some point you know
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes the question may not the
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
answer may not be available right then
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
and there you know i tell boards and we
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't put this in a policy or anything
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
but we tell boards and superintendents
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know if you have the answer
 
04:58:57.120 --> 04:58:58.230 align:start position:0%
you know if you have the answer
available

04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
you know it's somebody's talking about
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh
 
04:59:04.948 --> 04:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
somebody's talking about the leaky roof
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
or the new ball field or whatever and
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
the guy and the person making public
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
comments says
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
what was our budget last year with the
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
ba and the superintendent of the board
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
chair it was 20 million dollars so just
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
answer the question you know you don't
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
need to but you know if it's substantive
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know about well how is this
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum chosen and how often do you
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
review your curriculum what
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
considerations go into selecting your
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and your textbooks well that
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
may have to that may have to be a phone
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
call in a conversation between
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
the the inquirer and and either the
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
board chair the superintendent or the
 
04:59:37.030 --> 04:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
principal or whatnot so trying to craft
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
into a law how you do that it's so
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
specific based on the question that's
 
04:59:42.070 --> 04:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
being asked
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes represent ellison thank
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
you mr share thank you barry for taking
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:59:48.638 --> 04:59:49.430 align:start position:0%
my question
i

04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too far down into the
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
weeds on this but this is one where we
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
need to be specific uh
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
in terms of a meeting is laid out in the
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the amendment there would be the
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
public comment period before the meeting
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
you you've got something here which says
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
not less than one hour i'm trying to
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
figure out what the board chair does
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
when yeah i mean 100 people come in and
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the board shares trying to figure out
 
05:00:20.230 --> 05:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
how many of you want to speak right and
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
do i then or does the board say well
 
05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot there aren't many
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
we'll do 45 minutes we'll do 20 minutes
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
we'll do an hour we'll give people three
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
minutes we'll give people five minutes
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
that will end up being the purview of
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
the chair basically in your mind thank
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative it's
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
typically a board policy
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
um some policies can give the board
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
share flexibility relative to that
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
but and hsba would advise the board to
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a public comment policy i mean for
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
no other reason it spells out the rules
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
of engagement for the public and and we
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
tell people if you know you're going to
 
05:00:57.030 --> 05:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people showing up at a
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
meeting you know and about a lot it's
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
often you know more than five right we
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
say print off a copy of your policy and
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
put it on every chair or put it on a
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
table so people can grab it so they're
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
not surprised when they're cut off at
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
three minutes or they're not surprised
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
when they're talking about something
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
that may or may not necessarily be on
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
the agenda or or whatnot um so
 
05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
we think it's best done by school board
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
policy rather than it coming back on the
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
specific chair the specific person
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
making making the rules on the fly it
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
gives every the public a clear
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
expectation of what the rules are
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you mr
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
christina i'm not trying to belabor this
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm really just looking for
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
an actual uh process
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
so um parents have explained to me that
 
05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's very frustrating for them to to go
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
to a meeting
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
looking for answers and all that's
 
05:01:58.628 --> 05:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
available is public comment
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
so that does not require anyone to
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
answer them what my specific question is
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that oftentimes some things
 
05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
aren't available right away or
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to talk about in public
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
what is the process for getting a back
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
is that um i'm not trying to be
 
05:02:17.840 --> 05:02:19.110 align:start position:0%
is that um i'm not trying to be
disrespectful

05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
disrespectful
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
i just really don't know sure thank you
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative does the person want to
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the board or does
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
the person want a back and forth with
 
05:02:30.868 --> 05:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
somebody that can answer some of their
 
05:02:30.878 --> 05:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
somebody that can answer some of their
questions

05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
because that's going to depend on who
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
you contact um you know
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
i mean call the board share and see if
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
you can have a conversation with him or
 
05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
her call the superintendent and see if
 
05:02:44.550 --> 05:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
you can have a conversation with him or
 
05:02:44.560 --> 05:02:45.350 align:start position:0%
you can have a conversation with him or
her

05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
her
 
05:02:45.360 --> 05:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
her
um

05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
if if one individual wants to have a
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the full board
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know i i just
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's got to be an expediency
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
and efficiency aspect to this as well
 
05:03:03.280 --> 05:03:03.990 align:start position:0%
and efficiency aspect to this as well
too

05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
talking about and complaining about
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
board meetings running until 11 or 12
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night well if you're doing a
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
second public comment period at the end
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
of your meeting you can't do two hours
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
of back and forth in public comment
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
conversation at the beginning of the
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
meeting so i mean there's a first
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
amendment principle
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
called other avenues of communication
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
you can limit speech here
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
but you have to leave open other avenues
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
of communication those other avenues of
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
communication are a phone call an email
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so i mean
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm not trying to be vague
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative i hope you understand
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
that as well too
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
um but you know if we if we get into a
 
05:03:42.160 --> 05:03:44.310 align:start position:0%
um but you know if we if we get into a
dialogue

05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
dialogue
 
05:03:44.320 --> 05:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
dialogue
it

05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
that 30 minutes is going to run into two
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
hours and the back end public comments
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%

05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
mine seems to be
 
05:04:30.310 --> 05:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's usually that one right between
 
05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question um
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
rough cordelli's amendment seems to take
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
out um the comment period for the state
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
board of education
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
and is that something that you had put
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
in as or worked with senator carson or
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
something that's important to do sure
 
05:05:42.550 --> 05:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much um
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
i know mr klein is here and i certainly
 
05:05:46.628 --> 05:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
won't be speaking for him in the state
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
board but um the last typical public
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
comment period with typical in-person
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
people coming sign up two minutes three
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
minutes whatever um was march 2020 we
 
05:05:58.470 --> 05:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
all know what happened then
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
um then there was written public comment
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
only listed on the agendas from april
 
05:06:06.150 --> 05:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
2020 to june 2021
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
and there's been no public comment
 
05:06:09.510 --> 05:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
listed on any of the agendas for the
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
state board from july 2021 to the
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
present now i understand they have some
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
facility issues um that not my place to
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
speak about mr klein can do that um
 
05:06:21.280 --> 05:06:22.070 align:start position:0%
speak about mr klein can do that um
but

05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know it seems to be that if local
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
school boards are going to be obligated
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
to have a public comment period the
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
example should be set from our leaders
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a question represented
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
litchfield thank you and thank you for
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
if if i can get out something super long
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
in one breath it will count as one
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
question right hopefully
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
um okay you have three minutes to state
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
i can talk fast um so what
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
what i my experience has been in the
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
past regarding public comment
 
05:07:06.070 --> 05:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and the frustration with the public
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
is both let's say the principal the
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent any employees uh that are
 
05:07:10.320 --> 05:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
superintendent any employees uh that are
up

05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
at the table um if there's a simple
 
05:07:16.230 --> 05:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
question that is requested of them
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
they give the blank stare right and then
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the public gets really frustrated and i
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
think things escalate from there
 
05:07:22.080 --> 05:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
think things escalate from there
um

05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i've been told that they're not to
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
answer unless the board chair instructs
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
them to answer or i've even had them
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
look at me and say like i don't have to
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
answer i'm not supposed to answer handle
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
it sort of thing just curious
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get into the weeds but
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
it and i'll give you a simple example um
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know you talk about the answers that
 
05:07:47.430 --> 05:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
could be done very quickly you know sau
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
16 are a deliberative session at least
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
this year if not several years in a row
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
people have requested the population in
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the middle of high school and they're
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
not given it they've requested the
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
unreserved fund balance and they're not
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
given it and i feel like i know we're
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds and there's local
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
and the question is would i agree right
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
no no my question is what no my question
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
is how does it work as far as people
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
answering questions not in the policy
 
05:08:17.760 --> 05:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
answering questions not in the policy
right

05:08:18.550 --> 05:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative relative to employees i
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's a board meeting the employees
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
work for the superintendent i would
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
think that the employee should you know
 
05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
the chair and the superintendent should
 
05:08:30.638 --> 05:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
the chair and the superintendent should
ascertain

05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
ascertain
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not the employees are going
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
to speak and you know i i can't i can't
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
answer for every question that may have
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
been asked but not answered at a local
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:08:41.600 --> 05:08:42.868 align:start position:0%
school board
um

05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:44.550 --> 05:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know and i i don't want to throw
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
anybody under the bus either but you
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
know if you have what's the popular i
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
mean if you can answer the question
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
right there without requiring any
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
research it would be
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
the reasonable thing to do is provide
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
the information
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative are you done with your
 
05:09:03.360 --> 05:09:04.788 align:start position:0%
representative are you done with your
questions

05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow up
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe that sau 16 does have
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
resident only policies for a public
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
comment number one
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
05:09:17.430 --> 05:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes i did have
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'll save it that thank you thank you i
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
mean i didn't know that sau had 16 had
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
i guess doesn't surprise me that was not
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
the district or the sou i was speaking
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
about when i gave my example a few
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
minutes ago though
 
05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:34.480 align:start position:0%

thank you ms chair thank you for taking
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
my question to follow up just briefly on
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative hobson's question earlier
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
in a little bit on representative blitz
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
fields and i've been on the board so
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking a lot about public comment
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
and then this non-public session so
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a question will come up
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
during public comment and the response
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
will be that's a personal matter or
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
whatever and we'll take that up in
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
non-public so my question simply
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
is and i think you're probably a great
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
one to ask this are there
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure this has come up before are
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
there safeguards in place in terms of
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
accountability for when a board goes
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
non-public uh in terms of the trust of
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
the people because
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know folks oh god they're
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
part of military oh gosh they've gone to
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh non-public and we'll never know so
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
their safeguards are kind of what are
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
there mechanisms to reassure people that
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
that non-public is not being abused sure
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative um well at the very least
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
the one when the motion is made to enter
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
non-public session the motion has to
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
state the specific paragraph under which
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
um the the board or the public body is
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
being used it's rsa 91-a
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
cone three paragraph two and then
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's a b c d so on and so forth so
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
the motion on its face has to state
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
under paragraph a the minutes have to
 
05:11:00.788 --> 05:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
state under paragraph a
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and then it is the responsibility of
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the members of that public body to limit
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
their discussion and conversation only
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
to the purpose that was stated in the
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
motion for going into non-public session
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
um you know my experience is that most
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
boards have at least one um right to
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
know law hawk on them that you know i
 
05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to say keeps the other people
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
in check because the other people are
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing but the person
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
that knows the right to know very very
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
well make sure that the eyes are dotted
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
the t's are crossed and and i mean to
 
05:11:36.550 --> 05:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
some degree you know the board members
 
05:11:38.230 --> 05:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
have to be behaving properly when they
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
go into non-public session and limit
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
their conversation to to only the
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
matters the only the the purpose that
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
they entered in non-public session don't
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
talk start talking about a thousand
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
other things
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
i mean so the safeguards i mean
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
you know how do you know what's being
 
05:11:54.150 --> 05:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussed in non-public session i mean
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
there are non-public session minutes
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
obviously um that need to be released i
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's 72 hours if i'm not
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken unless they're sealed um
 
05:12:06.390 --> 05:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
that issue be the non-public session
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
minute issue
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
causes boards a lot of constant and this
 
05:12:13.350 --> 05:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
is off topic is it okay if i continue
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say consternation but
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's a balance between not putting
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything in minutes that is going to
 
05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
reveal the private or confidential
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
nature for which you entered into
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
non-public session right
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
if you put the detailed minutes that
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
discusses the student the staff member
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and you know the the confidential and
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
private reason why you're in non-public
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
session to begin with you have to seal
 
05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
the minutes then so they don't become
 
05:12:39.440 --> 05:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
the minutes then so they don't become
public

05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the other way to do that without
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
stealing minutes is to put the make
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
non-public session minutes very bland
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
the board entered non-public sessions
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph to discuss
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
a personnel matter
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
no decisions were made period so that's
 
05:12:56.070 --> 05:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
gonna you know and there's also a
 
05:12:56.080 --> 05:12:57.270 align:start position:0%
gonna you know and there's also a
balance

05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
balance
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you need the detailed minutes
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the non-public session because if
 
05:13:06.628 --> 05:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a staff discipline matter
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
and let's say you get a new
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent a year 18 months into the
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue when it's still ongoing and you
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
get new school board members you may
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
want to go back and read those minutes
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
from a year year and a half ago to
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
refresh your recollection what did the
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
board say what did the attorney say what
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
did you you know what did the
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent say those have to be
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
sealed then which frustrates the public
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
as well too but then if you put them
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
bland so you're not divulging anything
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
private or confidential that's
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
frustrating the public as well too
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know where that balance is
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm trying to satisfy the
 
05:13:38.550 --> 05:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
public's right to know while also make
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
sure school board doesn't get in trouble
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
for disclosing confidential information
 
05:13:43.520 --> 05:13:44.868 align:start position:0%
for disclosing confidential information
yes

05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's very helpful so my my quick
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is in your experience
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
have there ever been redacted uh
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
minutes from non-public that have been
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
issued yeah thank you for the question
 
05:13:58.080 --> 05:13:59.190 align:start position:0%
issued yeah thank you for the question
um

05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the curious thing about redaction is
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's a judicial creation there's nothing
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the right to know law that speaks to
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
redacting documents the supreme court
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
made it up
 
05:14:10.958 --> 05:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
made it up
um

05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other issue but yes um
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
the challenge with redaction is it's
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's timely and costly and i'm not
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
saying that's not appropriate you know
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know you a school board we know we
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
know what the right to know law so you
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
can go into non-public session to
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
discuss these issues and they all relate
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
to somebody's privacy or confidentiality
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's why you can that's why you can do
 
05:14:34.560 --> 05:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
that's why you can that's why you can do
it

05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:14:38.550 --> 05:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
redacting documents we we nhsba
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
recommends that you pass those minutes
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
or documents off to your private council
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be able to
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
identify better what may be a privacy
 
05:14:47.910 --> 05:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
issue what may be a confidentiality
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
issue aside from a layperson school
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
board member who you can recognize it
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
but you don't always necessarily know so
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the delay in the time and
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the cost and getting some of those
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
redacted documents and reactive minutes
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
out thank you very much
 
05:15:07.030 --> 05:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
barrett i have one question um
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
in looking at this type of bill right
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about comment periods
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
at various boards
 
05:15:13.360 --> 05:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
at various boards
how

05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
widely an issue is that in this state
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
sure i know i've attended my board
 
05:15:19.920 --> 05:15:21.190 align:start position:0%
sure i know i've attended my board
and

05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't had that problem
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
when i was on three terms in city
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
council we never had that problem right
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
um so what is the situation in the state
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
i i can read the papers i know there are
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
some places where there's been a lot of
 
05:15:34.638 --> 05:15:36.230 align:start position:0%
some places where there's been a lot of
acrimony

05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
acrimony
 
05:15:36.240 --> 05:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
acrimony
uh

05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:37.040 --> 05:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
uh
but

05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
what is it from your perspective as you
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
know working from the statewide new
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire school board association thank
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
you very much uh chairman ladd
 
05:15:45.600 --> 05:15:46.628 align:start position:0%
you very much uh chairman ladd
um

05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the smaller the community the less of a
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
issue it tends to be i mean i've been at
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
some school board meetings where you do
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
get the dialogue and you do
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
just have the conversation those are
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
small communities a k through 5 k
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
through 6 district with maybe a couple
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
hundred kids and the school board
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
meetings representative porter mentioned
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
maybe 45 minutes long or an hour long so
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
you can have an extra half hour
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know what we saw
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
the the the and and and the frustration
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
shared by some members of the of this
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
committee yes i've heard those from
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
members of the public i've heard those
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
from school board members i'm not going
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
to dispute that
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
um you know but what we saw last summer
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
and fall that was not a public comment
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
issue let's be clear about that that was
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
denying people the right
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
or an opportunity to speak that was
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
people who had no interest in
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
in in abiding by any reasonable
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
regulations at school board meetings
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
when 150 people were showing up and
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
yelling and screaming and the chief of
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
police has to grab the chair and the
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent off the stage and shuttle
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
them back and put them in a locked
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
secure room until everybody goes home
 
05:16:58.948 --> 05:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with a law public
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
comment or a school board policy
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
relative to public comments so
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know some districts had contentious
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
meetings i aware of one district i
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe senator carson said
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
her school board did not provide public
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
comments when this bill was first being
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
heard in in senate ed
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
former chair or a former school a former
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
school board member in londonderry and a
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
current school board member in
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
londonderry came to testify in support
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill and they talked about their
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
own experiences and i talked to them in
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
the hallway i said
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
why didn't your board adopt a public
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
comment policy then and i did so
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:17:33.520 --> 05:17:35.270 align:start position:0%
you know
it

05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating for some members of the
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
public and again i've heard the concerns
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
that have been shared by some members of
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's that that is what it is and
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to deny anybody an
 
05:17:48.310 --> 05:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to inform their their
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
elected officials of their concerns or
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
of their issues or complaints or
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be we're trying to
 
05:17:53.840 --> 05:17:54.628 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be we're trying to
find

05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
find
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
a system to manage how that can get done
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
while at the same time the board can
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
adopt policies adopt
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
review reports talk about the facilities
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
issue put its budget together you know a
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
typical school board meeting is probably
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
good efficient school board meeting for
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
just a medium-sized district it's
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
probably going to be two two and a half
 
05:18:16.560 --> 05:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
probably going to be two two and a half
hours

05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
do we have to make it four hours to
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
abide by this or to adhere to to a
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
public comment period i mean i if you
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to that that's fine and you know
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
some boards are more just more efficient
 
05:18:31.110 --> 05:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
in general than other boards
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
so you know is it statewide
 
05:18:36.310 --> 05:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative i would say no um you
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
know most of the um the issues that hit
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
the news and wmur last summer and fall
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
were in the southern part of the state
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of 95 up to i'd say
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
route 4 and over sort of that southeast
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
corner of the state from
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
nashua up to concord and then and then
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
over and there were some you know maybe
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
some other parts of the state but
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
the further north that you got i didn't
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
hear i we weren't getting calls or
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
concerns from
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
from from small districts up north
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
05:19:08.550 --> 05:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
question yes you did
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
school boards association
 
05:19:13.280 --> 05:19:14.948 align:start position:0%
school boards association
yes

05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
um if you could just please walk me
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
through this i think it would help so it
 
05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
had been drilled into my head for years
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
when i joined the school board and and
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
they do kind of use you as a bible the
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school board association
 
05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and in listening to
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
talk it's very different than what has
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
trickled down to me over the years and i
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate having this director right
 
05:19:37.510 --> 05:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
now um
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that being said though i've been told
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the past that you're not required to
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
have public comment and then you know
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school board
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
association is telling us this
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and then as representative hobson
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it is a meeting held in
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
public not a public meeting so when the
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
newer board members are being taught
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
that it is a meeting held in public not
 
05:20:02.550 --> 05:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
a public meeting and you also do not
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
need to offer any type of public comment
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think it kind of sets the tone like
 
05:20:08.400 --> 05:20:09.190 align:start position:0%
i think it kind of sets the tone like
look

05:20:09.190 --> 05:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
look
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're here in a huddle having a meeting
 
05:20:11.120 --> 05:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
we're here in a huddle having a meeting
and

05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's not your your business you can
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
listen and if you want
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm so i'm trying to under am i
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly is it
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know no thanks for the question
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative just to be clear it's not
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
nhsba telling boards that they don't
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
have to have a public comment period
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's the law telling school boards they
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a public comment
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
period and then nhsba is advising boards
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
on what the law is um
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:20:38.548 --> 05:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
to the question is it a public meeting
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
or is it a meeting of the public it's a
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
school board meeting
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
that has to be open to the public held
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
in public
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
so you know it's a business meeting of
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
the board that that's why we the board
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
has to meet to get its business done
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that business might be some
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
boards can do that efficiently with a
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
public comment period some boards
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
don't do that efficiently with or
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
without a public comment period
 
05:21:02.718 --> 05:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
without a public comment period
so

05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know it it it's a business meeting
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the board held in public under the
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
right to no law i think it's the
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
clearest way to say it
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
it's you know we have there are other
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
types of
 
05:21:14.080 --> 05:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
types of
um

05:21:15.190 --> 05:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
meetings that are more quote unquote of
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
like your budget hearing anybody who
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
wants to come and speak you have to let
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
them come and speak you can't deny you
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
can limit it to three minutes per person
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
and reasonable regulations like that but
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
if you get a thousand people that want
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
to come and talk about your your budget
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have to let all thousands of those
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
people who registered to sign up to
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
speak have their three minutes
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
um bond hearings are this are the same
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
way you know when any any there's a
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
difference between a meeting and a
 
05:21:46.708 --> 05:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
hearing for purposes of the law a
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
meeting under the right to know law is a
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
public body gathering to do its business
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
discuss its business deliberate vote in
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
public notice 24 hours minutes public
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
attend all that kind of stuff
 
05:22:00.868 --> 05:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
then there's a public hearing this is a
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
hearing right now this is a
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
this me speaking about senate bill 410
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
is a public hearing
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
you can limit to two or three people as
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
you do on the big bills when you get a
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
thousand people but if a thousand people
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
want to come and talk about senate bill
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
410 and they all sign up you have to let
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
them speak so that's the difference
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
between a hearing in a meeting so does
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
that help
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
should i have told you that like seven
 
05:22:27.190 --> 05:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
or eight years ago representative i
 
05:22:27.200 --> 05:22:28.470 align:start position:0%
or eight years ago representative i
apologize

05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%

committee a little bit of um i don't
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
know background or just to help you
 
05:23:03.910 --> 05:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
understand the state board situation and
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
um regarding public comment so the board
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
i inherited a public comment system
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
which was great and we kept it going um
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
barrett said there's always a
 
05:23:18.150 --> 05:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
first amendment or a right to know
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
absolutist on every board and that's me
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
on our board and
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
um and rich salah our our newest board
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
member he's also that way
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
um and my view of this is
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
i have the entire the board has the
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
entire board meeting to speak
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a business meeting as uh barrett
 
05:23:36.240 --> 05:23:38.868 align:start position:0%
it's a business meeting as uh barrett
said

05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
the value of having the public comment
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
section is uh
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
twofold one is to let
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who has some thoughts about what
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
might be on our agenda to let us know
 
05:23:49.440 --> 05:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
might be on our agenda to let us know
and

05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then you know to let us receive that
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
information like that informs our
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
thinking and our decision making and i
 
05:23:59.190 --> 05:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
found it very useful i i think public
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
comment is extremely useful
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so what happened with the
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
with us was obviously march 2020 covet
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
hit um we switched to written public
 
05:24:10.160 --> 05:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
hit um we switched to written public
comment

05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that remained i was uh if there was
 
05:24:13.920 --> 05:24:14.628 align:start position:0%
and that remained i was uh if there was
a

05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
if that was not getting noticed on the
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
agendas that was an oversight we have
 
05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
accepted written public comment since
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
march of 2020 and have said so in public
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
meeting multiple times
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
we intended to go back to public comment
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this year the
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
coveted numbers were high
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we've been monitoring it to try to
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
decide when do we open back up to public
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
comment and the complication we have is
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not in our building anymore
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i mean i think most you
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
know department of ed is being
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know mitigated for um asbestos so
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
we're renting space in the granite state
 
05:24:51.670 --> 05:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
college right now we don't control
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
that building
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
it is a key pad entry building
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
and they have very strict security at
 
05:25:00.150 --> 05:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
the building
 
05:25:00.160 --> 05:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
the building
so

05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:03.590 --> 05:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've tried to work out with them and
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're still talking with them how would
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh the only reason we haven't gone back
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
to public comment yet and i'm planning
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
to do it next week at next week's
 
05:25:10.798 --> 05:25:12.548 align:start position:0%
to do it next week at next week's
meeting

05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's just logistical it's just trying to
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
figure out do we need to have a police
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
officer on the door we didn't have a
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
security do we need department of
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
education staff
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
to let people in um you know and then
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
once they're in the building this is a
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
college building
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
um we don't
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
operate it uh when we're in our own
 
05:25:29.440 --> 05:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
operate it uh when we're in our own
building

05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know we consider it
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know public building department of
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
ed people come in we've never had a
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
problem it's great but this isn't our
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
space so we just have to figure out
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
logistically how we're upstairs
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
so people have to come in one door all
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
the doors are keypad locked um so they'd
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
have to be shown which door to come in
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have somebody on the door
 
05:25:52.150 --> 05:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
make sure they get upstairs to find our
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
meeting do we need two staffers you know
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
so anyway there's lots of
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
things logistical things to figure out
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure it works and it's okay with
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
granite state college our landlord and
 
05:26:04.548 --> 05:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
making sure people don't get in and just
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
kind of wander around the building and
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing we have college
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
students there
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
so um so that's it it's just a
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
logistical issue that's the only reason
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't gone back at this point to
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
in-person public comment but we have
 
05:26:15.440 --> 05:26:17.030 align:start position:0%
in-person public comment but we have
consistently

05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
taken written public comment i can tell
 
05:26:18.638 --> 05:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
taken written public comment i can tell
you

05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:26:19.760 --> 05:26:20.868 align:start position:0%
you
um

05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
this this bill is written in a way that
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to take into account the
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
fact that the vast majority of public
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
comment these days is email
 
05:26:29.600 --> 05:26:30.788 align:start position:0%
comment these days is email
um

05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
almost everything we get is on email uh
 
05:26:35.110 --> 05:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
the percentage of emails we get versus
 
05:26:36.548 --> 05:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
people showing up
 
05:26:36.558 --> 05:26:37.590 align:start position:0%
people showing up
um

05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:39.190 --> 05:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's a big discrepancy there i mean
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
you no longer
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
have to ride your horse to town meeting
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
and show up in person if you want to
 
05:26:48.070 --> 05:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know tell your appointed elected
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
official what you think
 
05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
you have direct access electronically to
 
05:26:51.680 --> 05:26:52.390 align:start position:0%
you have direct access electronically to
them

05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
through email so that's how we take most
 
05:26:55.590 --> 05:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
of it i'm happy to get back to written
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
public or to in person public comment
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
want to do it
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
and then excited about doing it but in
 
05:27:04.628 --> 05:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
writing a law
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
i would just suggest
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
there are unintended consequences um
 
05:27:11.680 --> 05:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
there are unintended consequences um
and

05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:14.548 --> 05:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
the way things are worded should be very
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
considered very carefully and i'll give
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
you an example we
 
05:27:17.600 --> 05:27:18.628 align:start position:0%
you an example we
um

05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
we have our public
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh input in the beginning of the meeting
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
always in the beginning
 
05:27:23.360 --> 05:27:25.590 align:start position:0%
always in the beginning
and

05:27:25.590 --> 05:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:25.600 --> 05:27:27.350 align:start position:0%
and
usually

05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
usually
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
typical that we may have three or four
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
people show up at most
 
05:27:32.788 --> 05:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
most of our stuff is not
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
um controversial it's just rule writing
 
05:27:36.390 --> 05:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:27:37.750 --> 05:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have public hearings we're required
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing on the rules
 
05:27:39.920 --> 05:27:41.670 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing on the rules
and

05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that's how the process works
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
unless it's something where
 
05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
it's extremely controversial issue
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
and one side or the other usually it's
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
not two sides sometimes it is sometimes
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
one side will get very upset and they'll
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
get activists involved and then
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
they'll send people to come for the
 
05:28:00.548 --> 05:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
public comment and i i think my first or
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
second meeting as board chair
 
05:28:04.868 --> 05:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
our public comment period lasted two or
 
05:28:07.590 --> 05:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
three hours we just let everybody speak
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
um and we've had several meetings like
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that and we didn't get out until five or
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
six um and then that's you know just the
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
way it goes
 
05:28:15.280 --> 05:28:16.470 align:start position:0%
way it goes
um

05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
and and and we don't
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
want to try to limit that
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
but i would just suggest that the way
 
05:28:25.510 --> 05:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is worded and i think rep porter
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
made a good point
 
05:28:29.110 --> 05:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
says public comment period shall be for
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
no less than 30 minutes
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
that should probably be clarified
 
05:28:33.680 --> 05:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
that should probably be clarified
to

05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:28:38.310 --> 05:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
let meetings start if nobody shows up or
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
if two people show up in the public
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
comment period and you don't have
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
anybody else there you don't want the
 
05:28:44.390 --> 05:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
board to have to sit there twiddling
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
their thumbs in a public meeting
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
and doing nothing
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
while waiting for that clock to run out
 
05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i think probably adding some language
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think representative cordelli
 
05:28:55.110 --> 05:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
suggested that would be a good thing
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about
 
05:28:57.040 --> 05:28:59.590 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about
um

05:28:59.590 --> 05:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
who should be allowed to speak if you
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
have people who are from out of
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
the community or not members not
 
05:29:06.160 --> 05:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
the community or not members not
residents

05:29:07.190 --> 05:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
residents
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
the wording in here
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't suggest that that would be
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
allowed it says provided such standards
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
are imposed equally for all speakers
 
05:29:15.440 --> 05:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
are imposed equally for all speakers
so

05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that would be consistent
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then on the last point would be
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
comment versus exchange and
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
i view public comment as i said as an
 
05:29:27.990 --> 05:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to listen
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's the real value added um and if
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
somebody asks a question we're happy to
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
ask answer a question but if you word it
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
in such a way where you're
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
requiring or it comes across as you're
 
05:29:40.948 --> 05:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
requiring the board to respond and
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
engage and ask questions
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
i get the intent
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
but i think that you could create
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
problems there i
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
i mean i've witnessed some meetings
 
05:29:50.798 --> 05:29:52.628 align:start position:0%
i mean i've witnessed some meetings
where

05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
public comment has happened and board
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
members have then taken it upon
 
05:29:59.910 --> 05:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
themselves to correct
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
the what they perceive to be incorrect
 
05:30:03.990 --> 05:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
statements of the public commenters
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you're encouraging that back and
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
forth that could be really good in terms
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
of getting answers but you could be
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging the board to engage in
 
05:30:11.760 --> 05:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
encouraging the board to engage in
discussion

05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:30:16.230 --> 05:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
might not
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually help the people who just came
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
to comment express their views i mean i
 
05:30:21.910 --> 05:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
again what we're talking about as a
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
hearing versus a business meeting and
 
05:30:27.030 --> 05:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
these are these are business meetings
 
05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
and you want to be able to connect your
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
business you want to be able to receive
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
that input but once you go
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
down the path of
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
making that a back and forth engagement
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
that can be productive but it can also
 
05:30:40.708 --> 05:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
be very counterproductive so just be
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
careful about how you think about
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
wording that that's all
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that's all so thank you very much
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
drew i have uh one um
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
when i've been involved in various uh
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
meetings like this
 
05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh and as a member of the either either
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
the council or a board
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've always had our policies and how we
 
05:31:02.160 --> 05:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
we've always had our policies and how we
conduct

05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
our meetings based on either robert's
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
rules or based upon masons which we do
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
here in the house it's always been
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
robert's rules though and we as a board
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
have adopted
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
a process that's in place
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
my concern with all this is that
 
05:31:19.360 --> 05:31:20.230 align:start position:0%
my concern with all this is that
i

05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:31:20.240 --> 05:31:21.270 align:start position:0%
i
i

05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the absolute need that people
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to comment and voice
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
a position
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
i do have a problem with
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
on high
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
making decisions in regard to how to
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
operate and regulate and get down in the
 
05:31:40.230 --> 05:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
weeds as far as writing 30 minutes or 40
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
minutes or this or that
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
does the state board of education have a
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
a policy or a format which they've
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
adopted on how they conduct school board
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
meetings or state board meetings i don't
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
think they're i didn't write one so
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
if tom raphael left me one uh i i don't
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
know where it is but my general i read
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
robert's rules of order years ago and
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how we follow it and i
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's anything that's
 
05:32:07.920 --> 05:32:09.030 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's anything that's
stated

05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
stated
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
to the public um that way but we
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
generally allow you know public comment
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
and welcome
 
05:32:15.990 --> 05:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
welcome it and
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know if there's questions answered
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
we try to get those answered you know
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
through the right channels if we don't
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
know muffed up our heads but
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
it may be worthwhile i think it's
 
05:32:25.110 --> 05:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
certainly worthwhile to always have a
 
05:32:25.120 --> 05:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
certainly worthwhile to always have a
written

05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
statement um if there is one it predated
 
05:32:28.080 --> 05:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
statement um if there is one it predated
me

05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:32:31.270 --> 05:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right representative
 
05:32:31.280 --> 05:32:32.548 align:start position:0%

05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
you very much chair klein um
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%

here and and i i agree with with much of
 
05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
what you um what you've just said and
 
05:32:45.680 --> 05:32:46.390 align:start position:0%
what you um what you've just said and
and

05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
i can certainly recognize you do have
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
very um you know long board meetings um
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
meetings of the state board can take all
 
05:32:54.080 --> 05:32:54.868 align:start position:0%
meetings of the state board can take all
day

05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:32:54.878 --> 05:32:55.670 align:start position:0%
day
and

05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i think you're doing a good job to
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently manage those meetings to get
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
through that based on what
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony uh this
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon but
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
is it also your testimony and i just
 
05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i get this right sure
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
that that um that your your current um
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
public comment um policy is as a result
 
05:33:17.120 --> 05:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
public comment um policy is as a result
of

05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
restricted acts public access to um to
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
your board meetings
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
to to the building itself right so we
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
accept written public comment and have
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
but the the so the meetings are public
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and you know if you show up you
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
know we'll let you in
 
05:33:34.638 --> 05:33:36.708 align:start position:0%
know we'll let you in
but

05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
having a a public comment period was
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
something we thought was a little tricky
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
to manage but given the limited access
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
to the building
 
05:33:47.190 --> 05:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay so so to be clear the the public is
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
not restricted to for in on
 
05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's a public meeting if somebody
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if somebody shows up we will let
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
them in but when you when you have when
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
you announce a public comment period
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
um you potentially run into lots of
 
05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
people showing up
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
and given that we don't own and control
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
the access to the building we're just
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to manage that
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
that's all okay thank you sure
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
i've been in that building many times
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
where would you go when you go into a
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
closed session or an executive session
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
where would the public go
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
the public can actually stay there we
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty decent space um we have a
 
05:34:28.240 --> 05:34:29.350 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty decent space um we have a
um

05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:31.110 --> 05:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
we have seating that's kind of separated
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
from our our table so we could meet in
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
the same place and just close those
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
doors or we also have a conference room
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
another level up that we can access for
 
05:34:43.030 --> 05:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah representative moffatt
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
ms cliff taking my question so um you
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned emails i hadn't some of us
 
05:34:56.788 --> 05:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
maybe didn't give them a start to but
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
certainly here we get a lot of uh email
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh a lot uh which is public comment
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
especially to a listserv so my question
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
a second hand or third person for
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
example earlier today
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
senator sherman was late and
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative luna
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
started off and introduced his bill on
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
his behalf
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
so in a public meeting um and i go back
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
to loudoun we had a town meeting and
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
there was a woman who came up to the
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
microphone and begged literally begged
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
permission to play a 30-second
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
electronic uh recording which the
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
moderator did not allow i think it made
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
everybody curious as to what was on
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
there but so my question to you is
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh for your purposes maybe you should
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
have asked this of mr christina as well
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
for public comment is it limited to
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
first person or can someone come and say
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
my uncle couldn't be here but i'm going
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
to read a statement from him
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah what about that um
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
i mean we've allowed people to read
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
statements from other people before i
 
05:36:00.480 --> 05:36:01.590 align:start position:0%
statements from other people before i
don't

05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
know that we've had somebody want to do
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
i think one time we might have had
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
somebody want to play a video i don't i
 
05:36:08.948 --> 05:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't think we allowed that
 
05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
um but we have a loud proxy testimony
 
05:36:14.470 --> 05:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
like for that same reason somebody
 
05:36:15.990 --> 05:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to be there and couldn't we
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely allowed that other you know
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative to give us
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
um comment for sure
 
05:36:22.320 --> 05:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
um comment for sure

thank you
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%

05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else in the public
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
would like to speak on this bill
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%

it for the day
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%

05:36:45.270 --> 05:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
anything today
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the next meeting we have is
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%

05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
bills that this committee has received
 
05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then there will be uh two days later
 
05:37:07.590 --> 05:37:07.600 align:start position:0%

05:37:12.070 --> 05:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
out of this committee by the next day on
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%

here

05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
there may be some other bills which we
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
have heard that we feel that we can exec
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll try and take care of them so
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
we can get some of these bills on the
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
agenda for the 21st
 
05:37:28.628 --> 05:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to end up with all our
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
education bills on later on in the 28th
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
i've been told
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's right patty that that was the
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
last bill we got was on
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
friday was the last one we got we got an
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
early bill handed to us on friday
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
and so that just gave us this and then
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
we have to post it
 
05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
and as soon as we could really get to it
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
the 11th
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%

05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
had to have it out of committee not not
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
