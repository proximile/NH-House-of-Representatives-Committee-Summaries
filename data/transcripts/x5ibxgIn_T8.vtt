missing adult program and missing
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adult alert program these
 
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
rules are adop or adoption so their new
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
rules to implement RC
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
106j which was amended back in
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
2016 the only comment I have on this
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposal is there is a question of why
 
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
it took the department so long to adopt
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
these rules um as they were statutorily
 
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.350 align:start position:0%
these rules um as they were statutorily
mandated

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
to would you like to respond to that
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
question why it took so
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
long could you hit the button uh so red
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%

mallerie Litman the New Hampshire State
 
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
Police uh the question is a valid one uh
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
I will be 100% transparent I have just
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
started I'm about two months in to this
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
job so I am catching up as well as to
 
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
why it took so long for it to get in
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
front of you and to become a rule from
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding uh it did go through
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to get here right
 
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.270 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to get here right
now

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately due to staffing issues
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
and then covid and then a a couple more
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
staffing issues by me um it it did take
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
longer than it should
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
have questions from the committee seeing
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
is the pesticide control board item
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
number 146 aquatic application of
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
pesticides yeah so um this proposal
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
makes amendments to the rules on the
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
Aquatic application of pesticides there
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
are a lot of editorial comments and a
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
few unclear editorial comments that
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
really do need to be addressed but um no
 
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request has been
 
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.430 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request has been
filed

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
there is one unclear comment in
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
particular to bring to your attention
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
and you'll find that on the top of page
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
20 of the meeting
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
packet so what's happening there in the
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
rule is that the agency has issued a
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
special permit for the application of
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
pesticides but the applicant decides
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
that they need to postpone the pesticide
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
treatment and in that case the applicant
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
must notify the agency the rule says
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
that if the division finds as a result
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
of the postponement of the pesticide
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
treatment that adverse effects on human
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
health and the environment are likely
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
that it may reconsider its decision on
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
the special permit but the rule does not
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
describe even at a high level how the
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
division will make the decision to
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
change the permit's terms it doesn't
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
describe um what they will be
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
considering or whether the division will
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
mandate that the applicant actually
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
perform the pesi pesticide
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
application so um I did have an email
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
conversation with the agency and um the
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
department states that in the past 16
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
years they haven't had this situation
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
happen and so they um don't really have
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
any criteria that they um want to put
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
into the rule so um I do think though
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the rule really you know ought to
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
say that the vision shall reconsider the
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
special permit instead of May reconsider
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
but um even if they cannot Place
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
criteria and the rule to describe you
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
know what they will be looking at and um
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
what they will do around on that uh
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
special permit but anyway that's the um
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
only um substantive comment to bring to
 
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
only um substantive comment to bring to
your

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
attention chman please David rouso with
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire division of pesticide
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
control under the Department of
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food and I'm
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
representing the div uh pesticide
 
00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
representing the div uh pesticide
control

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
board so we can certainly um if if it's
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay to respond yeah um we can certainly
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
take those comments and provide an a a a
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
revision to to that section of the rules
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
to either
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
um identify the criteria that already
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
exists when a special permit is issued
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
initially um and certainly change that
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
question so it says if the St could show
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
us where the I think they did change
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so it says say that um
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
as a result of the postponement of
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
treatment adverse effects on human
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
health and the environment are likely it
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
shall after a hearing reconsider its
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
original decision I'm sorry so I
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
misspoke there but um I don't know
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
whether or not they you know can add any
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
additional language to kind of you know
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
give some broad criteria here or not um
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
you could perhaps postpone and allow
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
them to do a conditional approval
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
request um your deadline isn't until
 
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.230 align:start position:0%
request um your deadline isn't until
March

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
25th representative L uh thank you Mr
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
with us um part of my question around
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
this is if it's postponed for only 5
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
days or 30 days there may not be a need
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
to reconsider the decision but if it's
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
postponed for 180 days um there may be
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
and my question is if you reconsider it
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
if it's based on environmental factors
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
changes to rules or laws since it was
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
implemented and to just understand what
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
that change is so that there could be
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
consistency and um predictability for
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the agencies would be
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay with the postponements we don't
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to act on this we have another we
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
could we could take it up in our March
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
meeting to give you time to respond to
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
the comments and make additional changes
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
is that acceptable to the agency
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
definitely thank you so i' entertain a
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%

number2 yeah so um the oplc has uh
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
requested uh that this item be postponed
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
to the April meeting so that the board
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
can uh vote on a conditional approval
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
request uh to address all the comments
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
there aren't a ton of comments on it um
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
the board is not meeting in February so
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
the request is to postpone this to April
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
um like I said they're not meeting um
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
this month and their next meeting is
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
actually scheduled for March 21st which
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
is the same um date as this committee's
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
meeting so um if the Jael card agrees to
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
this request it will need a waiver of
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
its deadline to act which is um March
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
25th um in order to hear this proposal
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
in April so Iain a motion to Grant a
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
waiver and postpone the item um given
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
the comments of the
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
removed by representa Maguire second by
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips any
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
further comment yes please um yes thank
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just concerned that
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
they're not meeting regularly enough
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
especially if um oplc is sending this to
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
them as a courtesy it would be very good
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
for them to meet frequently enough in
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
order to review the rules and so I'm
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
concerned that they met I think 18 times
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
last year and now they're skipping a
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
February meeting and um I'd just like
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
them to be mindful of the deadlines
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
moving forward and meet so that they can
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
re they can review
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
these Doug I just asked you to take that
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
to uh commissioner
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
um for got I remember D jurus and and
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
just let her know the comments to the
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
board all we all those in favor of
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
postponing waiver say I I all those
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the items postponed and the
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
waiver is
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
granted next up is Department of Revenue
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
Administration item number 164 for
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
tax now you got my
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
attention so the agency did submit a
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
addressed um the majority of my
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
substantive comments however there is a
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
remaining issue regarding the forms the
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
agency does have an exemption under RSA
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
541a 21 VA and RSA 21
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
j3a that exempts the requirements on the
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
forms from having to comply with the
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
manual and um the typical things we look
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
for when it comes to uh forms and the
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
rule text however
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
our staff has come to the conclusion
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
after a legal analysis that this does
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
not exempt them from not having the
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to complete a form in their
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
rule text so when the agency submitted
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
this proposal they did submit number of
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
forms some of them um it has turned out
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
is Incorporated in other chapters of the
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
rules which are fine they're just kind
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
of given for context but some of the
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
forms are mentioned in the instructions
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
of forms that are required in the rule
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
text but they themselves are not
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
required in the rule text so that's
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
where we're having a bit of a issue in
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
that we think that it is um a
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
legislative intent issue to not include
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
those forms in the rule text so the
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
agency and I have had conversations they
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
are willing to do an amended conditional
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
approval to address that and get those
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
forms into the rule text which would
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
address the issue um the committee's
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
deadline on this isn't until March 31st
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
so you would have the ability to review
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
that amended CA at the March meeting
 
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.350 align:start position:0%
that amended CA at the March meeting
thank

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
you good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Jennifer Ramsey I'm tax
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
policy counsel for the Department of
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration um I agree with
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
the assessment that you've just heard
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
about the forms we have not typically
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
included all of the schedules that
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
support the five basic tax returns in
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
the rules and that is what we were down
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
to is a list of all of the supporting
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
schedules if the committee would like
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
those incorporated into the rules the
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
3072 to 07 list the five basic tax
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
return types um and we could in those
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
rules add a an addition that said and
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
any of the applicable schedules so if
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
the committee would like that we're
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
happy to do that um we haven't done it
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
in the past but it's not a
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
problem questions questions from the
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee so you're amendable to a
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
postponement of this rule to allow you
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
to adopt changes into the rule to
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of yes that's fine
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
with us so entertain a motion to
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
postpone rule number
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
164 uh it's been moved by representative
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
Leon second by representative Maguire to
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
postpone item number 164 until the March
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
meeting so that the agency can take into
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
account the comments of Staff any
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion all those in favor
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I did not have enough chance to see
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
and make sure that those are actually
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
all in the statutes um just as we're
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
transitioning into this and people are
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
finding information out at the last
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
minute with Jael car I would ask to
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
postpone it so that I can go through it
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
and by next Friday let the department
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
know if there are any concerns that I
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
have moving forward um I know this is
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
sort of asking for Grace to have a last
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
minute um imposition I am going to start
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
messaging to people and making sure that
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
they know the full process to come to
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearings so that people are
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
involved at the appropriate time in the
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
process um however since we are not up
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
against a deadline um I would like to
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
postpone it just to just to ensure that
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
those concerns are consistent are
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
concerns with the underlying law and not
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
with the implementation of the rules any
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
other comments on any other comments on
 
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:29.070 align:start position:0%
other comments on any other comments on
postponement

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radme administrator
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
Services um I know we have discussed we
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
are agreeable to postponing however I do
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the record uh want to say that this
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
rule prior to formal rul making uh went
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
out to stakeholders three
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
times um with no responses the public
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
hearing was had nobody had shown up and
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
we received no public comment um at all
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
in this role um the years pass then
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
we've got gone through this stakeholders
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
showed up uh we addressed issues um so I
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
just I want to get that on the record
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
that we do work with our stakeholders
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
very diligently especially with this
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
rule because of how lengthy it is thank
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%

comment all those in favor there's no
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
waiver required for this we can make it
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the meeting and still stay within our
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
timelines as required so all those in
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
favor of postponement say I I I all
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
those oppos nay guys have it we'll
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
postpone till next month
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll take up the next item item
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
236 um the Farmers Market nutrition
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
program for women and P children yeah so
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
um this proposal seeks to implement a
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
new program this farmers market program
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
that was actually passed in House Bill 2
 
00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.350 align:start position:0%
that was actually passed in House Bill 2
from

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
2023 and there are just two issues to
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention the first one is
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
that delay and implementation the house
 
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
bill 2 was effective in uh July 1st of
 
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.230 align:start position:0%
bill 2 was effective in uh July 1st of
2023

00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
so there's been a delay of almost 2
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
years um the department did state in its
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
response to that comment that the agency
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
didn't know that rules were needed but
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
the statute does clearly direct the
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
agency to adopt rules so it's not
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
entirely clear um why the agency didn't
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that it needed some Ru making
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
around this program uh the agency also
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
did state that the program is scheduled
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
to be rolled out this summer so um it
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a two-year delay um
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
of that roll out um this the second
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
comment is an informational note that
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
lets the committee know um that the
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
prohibited items the items that aren't
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
covered under this program those three
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
items are dried herbs herb plants and
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
pickled vegetables those are actually
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
listed in the New Hampshire state plan
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
and um as prohibited as not being
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
non-covered they aren't listed in the
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
federal rag but um the but the Federal
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
Regulation does allow agencies to
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
over what to permit so um those are my
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
only two comments on this
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
one question uh agency good morning
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
again uh Allison radme uh administrator
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
for the administrative rules unit at the
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm going uh to pass this over to
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
the program to
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
address hello my name is Haley mlar I'm
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
the nutrition service section
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
administrator in the Bureau of family
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
and health and nutrition um and I would
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
like to address uh the note so when the
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislative language was added to House
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 in 2023 and became law the
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
department had a staffing transition
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
within the nutrition service section
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
during due to this transition
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the prompt initiation of
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
rule making was missed and not done on
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
schedule by the department once the
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
delay was realized by the depart the
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
department immediately began the rule um
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
drafting uh process for this program I
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
would also like to add that we we had an
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
lengthy Contracting process we started
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
that immediately after the rule was
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
created in July and it took about 18
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
months to get a contract in place so we
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
just had our contract fully executed
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
program any questions from the
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative mire
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
sorry yes thank you um Cons considering
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
that this benefit is between1 and $30
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
per recipient I'm I feel justified in
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
saying that the administrative costs
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
will probably exceed the benefits and
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons we argued we
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
debated this last
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
budget repr Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm actually a little
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that the herb plants aren't
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
included I would think that these
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
programs are supposed to have more
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
self-reliance and um I'd rather see
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
people bringing home a basil plant that
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
they continue to um that they're
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to use in their cooking than
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
just some cut basil leaves I know that's
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
part of the state plan but um I just
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that as a concern
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
because I think we should be lifting
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
people up not just making them continue
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
to keep purchasing
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
things F questions from the
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
committee as a former markers as a
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
former Farmers Market director I think
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's a great program I know we did roll
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
some of this out with ebts quite a few
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
years ago and do now include the women
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and fit and children is is great to see
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
citizens using our local farmers for
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
what they're consuming rather than
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
stores I agree and if you'd like I to
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion I'll move to approve
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's been moved to approve there second
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
second by sen long any further
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative from oplc reached out
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
and requested a postponement because
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
they want to work with the board on a CA

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
need a waiver because the deadline for

the committee is March 11th all of the
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
comments I had on the final proposal
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
could be addressed with a conditional
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
request it's mostly just discrepancies
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
between the requirements and the rule
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
text and the form so very easily fixable
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend a CA request to
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
address those thank you Mr chair would
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
you entertain a motion for waiver and
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
postponement so waiver and have them
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
adopt the changes recommended by staff
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
is that the mo a postponement to allow
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to do a conditional
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
approval request so move so move second
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
is there any further
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all those in
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
favor of postponement in waiver signify
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
by saying I I all those opposed nay the
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
eyes have it we've granted a waiver and
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
we postpone till the March meeting next
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
up is the board of psychologists uh rule
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
number two uh
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
234 um temporary license or application
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
process for those licens in other
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
states so this proposal is uh has a
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
unique issue in that when the notice was
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
published in the register with the
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
IP it was noticed that this entire rule
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
was going to be repealed because the
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
oplc now has the authority to handle
 
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.909 align:start position:0%
oplc now has the authority to handle
temporary

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
licenses there was a comment made by OS
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
staff um as a suggestion to perhaps
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
reference the oplc rules instead of just
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
repealing the entire section so at least
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
then people if they're looking in these
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
rules could go to the oplc rules the
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
board did do that and it's our position
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
that that is covered under the notice
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
because the notice talks about the
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
change in Authority however the board
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
also reinserted paragraph B which it
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
said it was going to repeal and
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph B talks about what
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
entities um would be allowed to bring
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
people to New Hampshire in an emergency
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
and allow those people to practice
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
without a temporary license for 60 days
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
there is a statute that allows this the
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
statute only references two entities but
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
then gives discretion to the board to
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
include additional
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
entities we do not think this is covered
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
by the notice we don't think the public
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to comment on this
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
particular paragraph um and therefore we
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
made a legislative intent comment that
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
the process wasn't properly
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
followed um at this point I have talked
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
with board counsel and um they seem to
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
understand our concern and and the issue
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
and at this time my recommendation to
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
the committee would be to do a
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection based on
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and allow the board
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to hold an additional
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
hearing as I understand there's
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
precedent for this that this has
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
occurred before um in order to correct
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
that lack of public notice and lack of
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
public opportunity to
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
comment moved on let's hear from the
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%

and with the board's attorney and we're
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
chair just a quick question about the
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
timeline after the second hearing how
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
much longer do you think it will take to
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
return to administrative rules or Jael
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
car for the presentation um if I may so
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
if you issue a preliminary objection the
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
board then has 45 days in order to do
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
their response so they would have 45
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
days to publish notice in the register
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
about the hearing hold the hearing and
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
then provide us the information of what
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
happened at the hearing um and if they
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
need additional time to do that they
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
would have to request a waiver uh from
 
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.149 align:start position:0%
would have to request a waiver uh from
the

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
director and the notice period for our
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
office is 20 days um so they can file we
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
can get a notice in the register and
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
then because it's a board their public
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
comment period can end at the end of the
 
00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:45.950 align:start position:0%
