00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
presentations and uh first up here from
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of uh administrative
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
Department I did oh I turned it off
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
sorry uh good morning my name is Dana
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
call I'm the state comproller um
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
normally uh commissioner Arling house
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
would be here with me but he got tied
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
into another meeting this morning so I'm
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to cover the presentation for him
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
but he says hello he
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
knows um today we're going to talk a
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
little bit about some overview of what
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
services does in regards to revenue
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
reporting as well as talk about one
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
small piece of the revenue estimating um
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be ultimately doing
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
and and some details on that so I will
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
get started um on my presentation is the
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
black and white
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
one so on page two um we have a central
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
oversight role at Das um to oversee all
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
of the financial information and within
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
that uh my division is the division of
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
accounting services I'm the director of
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
that Division and we prepare a lot of
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
the Statewide reporting that you are
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with I gave you a few
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
bullets of uh what those standard
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
reports are that we issue either on an
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
annual monthly quarterly basis uh the
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
focus the revenue focus with the
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general education trust
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
funds is probably the one you may be
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
most familiar
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
with um moving on to page three as
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the monthly Revenue focus
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
is a snapshot in time of how cash
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
receipts are coming in the door uh a lot
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
of that reporting we coordinate directly
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
administration because they have uh the
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
largest piece of that collection effort
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh we don't collect any actual revenues
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
at administrative service is uh for the
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
most part we do uh some inter agency
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
billing amongst our other state agencies
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
but as far as outside Revenue collection
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's coming in from the various state
 
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
agencies we compile the information and
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
report on what happened for the uh
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue plan that is set legislatively
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
through House Bill one and House Bill
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
two as part of the banial budget process
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's an annual plan for General
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
general education Highway fund and
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
fishing game uh those unrestricted
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
revenues are determined by the
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
legislature and what we do is work with
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
the state agencies that do the
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
collections to try to best estimate what
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
month those collections will come in so
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
that we can do the revenue Focus as
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
again a snapshot in time but there is no
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
monthly Revenue plan stipulated by the
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
legislature it's an annual plan and we
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
just track how the monthly receipts are
 
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.870 align:start position:0%
just track how the monthly receipts are
coming

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
in anything else that happens
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
significant through other legislation if
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
it affects unrestricted Revenue um we
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
will make footnotes on that plan as well
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
so on our website for accounting
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
services I gave you the link where you
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
can find the actual plan as well as the
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
monthly Revenue Focus
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
reports on page four is sort of a brief
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
timeline of how it generally Works in
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
this U budget
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
cycle so hopefully we have a budget by
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
July 1 and on in July week one we issue
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh the final
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
Focus cach basis uh for the previous
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
June which is the final one for fiscal
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
year 2025 because again we're on a
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year basis starting in July
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
ending in June each
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
year um then in July a little bit later
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
we issue sort of a preliminary acral
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
because what happens is we take cash
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
basis receipts we convert them to acral
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
basis take into account uh generally
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
accepted accounting principles and
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
timing of revenues and we that is what
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately lands in the state's audited
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
Financial statements which is referred
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
to as the Aur so the annual
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report um is
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
what results in these adjustments that
 
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.069 align:start position:0%
what results in these adjustments that
we

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
make so um we'll put out in also in the
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
July August time frame like I mentioned
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
we'll be preparing the uh annual plan
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year and we do that
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
prospectively so we put the plan out as
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
well as the first report for the first
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
month of the new fiscal
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
year um so that's a lot I'll stop if any
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions so far on the
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
process any
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none just going to keep
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
through okay um so on page five we'll
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit of the other
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue category um and I'll give you
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
some context on that so for the general
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
fund unrestricted Revenue we collect
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
about $2 billion a year of that the
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
traditional other miscellaneous Revenue
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
sources amount to about 60 million in so
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
just to put it in perspective it's a
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
very small piece of the overall picture
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
um that is without the interest and
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
surplus uh AED property money that um
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
the treasur is going to speak to so just
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
the regular everyday miscellaneous items
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
that come through as other
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
unrestricted um so that's these are on
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
Slide Five um some of the larger dollars
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
so page six as mentioned um the portion
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
the first three lines of this chart is
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
really the miscellaneous other uh there
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
is a general other other miscellaneous
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
which is about 200 different uh small
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources which I've put in the
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the presentation just to give
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
you a sense of what those are um the
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
types of revenues that come in but you
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
can see there is some variation in this
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
line item it's not predictable it is on
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
average about 30 32 million or so over a
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
course of several years but any given
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
year we could uh an agency could have
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
something that causes it to go up or go
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
down so we don't really have a good
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
prediction ability on
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous the second two lines the
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of indirect costs and
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
post-retirement recoveries I have a
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
couple slides on those so we'll get into
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
those those are uh administered and
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
build and collected by the department of
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
administrative services so I can speak
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
to a little bit about those further and
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
as mentioned the treasurer will cover
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
her two line
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
seven this is a just a little bit more
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
detailed depiction of what rolls up into
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous other uh we track these
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
particular line items monthly as part of
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
that overall Revenue Focus reporting we
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't put this particular table in the
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
focus but the bottom line total of this
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
table is what appears in the revenue
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
Focus uh some of these uh you might hear
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
from the other agencies presenting uh
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
later in this process because these
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
particular agencies um do track and
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
collect these on their own and we'll set
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
projections as best they can but what
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
this gives you is sort of a actual of a
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
couple of years where we think we might
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
land for fiscal 25 which we're just
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of right now and
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
then for 26 27 is our best guesstimate
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
of where we might be uh going forward
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I've coordinated with the treasurer
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
so so she'll again speak to her line
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
items but in total um this is what we
 
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.069 align:start position:0%
items but in total um this is what we
look

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
like for the 2627 budget cycle um again
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
these are relatively small um about 50
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
million 53 million in total of that $2
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
billion number so um these don't tend to
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
vary too too much individual line items
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned might um and I'll get
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit on the next
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
couple slides
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you Mr
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh just line 28 the
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
interest projected I did we use a wrong
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
rate or was it just that the the money
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
was there was so much more of it or what
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what drove that number
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
yeah that is that's the interest on the
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
surplus funds that the treasur is going
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to so you'll get the the whole
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
detail on that thank you um are these
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
all actual numbers or the numbers in
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
thousands these are so so they the total
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
is million so of the Total Line 50
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
million dollar so um some of them are
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
1.2 million some of them are the very
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
top line is $731,000
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
so these are
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
rounded generally you work in millions
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
so right right but um okay so page eight
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'll just talk about on I'm going to
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
cover what is um line nine on the chart
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and line 11 on the chart those are the
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
cost recoveries that our agency um bills
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
and collects from from within the state
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
agencies so the first one is the
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide indirect costs that's the
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
considered the S cap plan and it's just
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
a cost allocation mechanism where we um
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
basically Bill and collect the Central
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
Services like my office and the budget
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
office and uh Treasury office and a lot
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
of the Central Services that serve
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
entire State we're all generally funded
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the most part so we recover those
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
costs a portion of that from any outside
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
funding predominantly federal funds so
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
if Federal if if agencies are um
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
applying for federal grants they will
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
include a budget for this internal cost
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
as part of uh reimbursement from the
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
feds so it does vary uh it's on a 2-year
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
cyclical cycle um we we do a swap
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
allocation report every year where we
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
calculate the cost cost but it's on a
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
2-year lag so we have to take actuals
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
based on the time frame because the cost
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
allocation plan gets submitted and
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
approved by the feds so the federal
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
government has to look at our plan it
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
has to be based on prior actuals so with
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
that lag time it ends up being a
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
two-year lag so there is some variation
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
from year to year on what actually
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
occurred um and what we submit to the
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
feds for approval but ultimately they
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
approve our our cost allocation plan it
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
gets posted on our website and then
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
going forward agencies will include
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
those figures in their um Grant budgets
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
and any other outside funding that is
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
not general fund because we don't charge
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves for our general funding costs
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of that happens in my office
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
we do the calculation we work with the
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
feds we work with agencies on what to
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
budget we submit we we give them their
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
bills they pay us and it's all part of
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
the uh regular budget cycle um so that
 
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
is the direct costs and then on page
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
nine it's a similar concept on the
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
post-retirement benefits we have a
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
retiree Health budget in administrative
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
Services uh the bulk of it is General
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
funds so if unless an agency is build
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
directly uh for their piece some of our
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
agencies are but for those that are
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
generally funded that is the uh again
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
down the road so the federal government
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
allows us to apply a rate again in those
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
um grants and other line items where we
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
need to budget for those costs and we
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
recover that through an internal uh
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
process as well so all of those revenues
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing align with
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
expenditure class lines in your in the
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
agency budget so if any of you are
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing agency budgets um you'll see
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
those class lines appear as an inter
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
agency cost so we're not paying
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
administrative Services we're paying the
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
general fund essentially um and it
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
becomes an unrestricted Revenue pool to
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
fund all of the various things that are
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
funded through General
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
funds so those are the two line items
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
that really are um somewhat material on
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
those on that chart um and then like I
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
said the last two pages is just kind of
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of the different types of
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous items that come through
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
the the various state agencies that we
 
00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
the the various state agencies that we
report

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
on and that concludes my presentation if
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing n everything that
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh stud Treasurer Monica missipi and
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
back so to today um um I'll just provide
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
you with a brief overview of of the
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
Treasury Department and then we'll then
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
I'll move to discuss the revenue sources
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
in more detail so um I believe you have
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
a presentation um handed out and I'll
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
begin with um just uh mentioning uh the
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
treasury Department has uh 22 approved
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
positions there are five five
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
unclassified and and 17 classified
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
positions um the main uh on page three
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
you can see um the main functions of the
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
State Treasury um so treasury operations
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
were responsible for uh the core
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
treasury functions of the state we
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
collect and uh we oversee all of the
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
bank deposits and all of the Statewide
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
dispersements um and we uh obviously uh
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
take care of uh we have the relationship
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
with with the banks and we um you know
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
we perform all of the banking uh
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
activities um including um Bank
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
reconciliations um with that oversight
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
uh whatever we don't need for current
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
expenses we do invest as we mentioned as
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that when I was here um last
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
time uh we invest all of the funds that
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
we have um custody of um so we'll we'll
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
talk about um those invest or those um a
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
little more of the cash activities uh
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation and um we also
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
are responsible for our debt management
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
um activities we do issue bonds um to
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
fund our capital projects for the most
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
part and then we also responsible for
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
paying that service for tracking our
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures to make sure that
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
we are AB bonding what we need and we do
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
have some compliance requirements um we
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
do have to monitor our compliance with
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
IRS uh regulations um because we issue
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
tax tax except months and we also
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
because we're uh issuers of Municipal
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
Securities we have some um disclosure
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to um take
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
care of every
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
year uh also um there other programs
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
that are specific to State treasuries
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
and and we are um we we share similar
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with other states we do
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
have the oversight of the fonan college
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
savs program uh we do collaborate with
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
with the college tuition Savings Plan
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
advisory commission for the program the
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
program is a very successful program we
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
have we are the fourth largest in the
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
country we have about 20 close nearly 28
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
billion dollar in assets on the
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
management in that
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
program um the other another the program
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's very similar to that but this is
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh for individuals with disabilities say
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire aable plan that is a
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
younger plan and there we recently
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
switch um uh Partners we we used to be
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
be partners with the state of Ohio uh we
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
decided and I shared this responsibility
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
with the governor's Commission on
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
disability and recently we changed
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
Partnerships we're now members of the
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
national member National able Alliance
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so we essentially started that new
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
the program with with that um
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
partnership and we have right now about
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
1.8 million um dollars in assets under
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
the management about just 200 accounts
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
um however um other um um
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that were part of the
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
initial program uh right now those are
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
granders have the ability to have uh
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
accounts and those are about a thousand
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
accounts under this stable New Hampshire
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
program and
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
um we also have the oversight of three
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs that is part of um
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
we there's a a small um um fee that it
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
that comes from the Fon a plan and with
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
that we're able to fund three
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs again I'm just
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
going and very
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh broadly discussing this this
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
program I'm happy to to provide more
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
information on them um you know in a
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
different time and and of course we are
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the aband property
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
program which I will um cover in more
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
detail um using the next
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
slides so moving on to um slide four um
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
again we're responsible for L claim
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
property program and uh pursuing to
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
Statue we are uh responsible for for um
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
overseeing the um reporting and
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
remittance of all unclaimed property um
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
for those um to be able to return those
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
funds to uh the rifle owner so after um
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
a period of uh a dorcy period of about
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
five years holders of property report
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
that property annually to us and that
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
can be um anything from bank accounts
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
and cash checks Securities stocks
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
um mutual funds life insurance proceeds
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
Etc and so those are reported to us in
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
an anal basis and
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
um most of those holders are obviously
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
Banks corporations utilities insurance
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
companies and so in uh fisc year 24 um
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
we had about
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
4,500 um companies reporting to us and
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
that was about $ 31.3 million in
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
property and about 35.6 millions in um
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
Securities we also have um we also have
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
contracts with other firms um those
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
firms conduct um out ofate Audits and
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
multi-state audits those companies are
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
able to bring to us about 80% of the
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
property that is reported to us and
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
whatever we don't we don't return um
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
most of that property is a cheated to
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
the general fund so I'll I'll describe
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
that in a little
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
later in the
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
presentation so on page five um it just
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
shows a graph of how we've been um how
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
the reporting has happened over the last
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
10 years and so over the last 10 years
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
we've we collected about 222 million in
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
um in property and the average is about
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
22.2 million uh annually as you can see
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
the the reporting has increased over the
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
last few years just last year was um as
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
million if I may stop you for a minute
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
um how much of that does the I mean
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
obviously some of it probably gets
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
returned to people but how much is there
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
an average each year that actually the
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
state keeps because certain amount of
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
time has gone by and you haven't found
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
who it is yes uh it's it's pretty
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
consistent so um I don't have the exact
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
percentage but it's
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
about it's about 177% that gets um that
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
gets re returned to the rifle owner so
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
the rest really um is treed to a general
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
fund um actually in the act for um the
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
we don't report the entire liability um
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
of all the property we own so as a
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
liability we report about just and 23 we
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have the 24 uh numbers but
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
23 reported that it was the liability it
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
was about $28 million that's really the
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
amount we expect to to um to return um
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
we try to return property obviously the
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
the the sooner is reported to us that's
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
easier to return the property that there
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
is held that is older obviously that's
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's more difficult to um um it just it
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
just stays with
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
us hopefully that answers your question
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
you so in total really we have about in
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
in total claim property we have about
 
00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:00.310 align:start position:0%
in total claim property we have about
400

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
400
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
million um and um again as I mentioned
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
the liability on the books is about 27
 
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.990 align:start position:0%
the liability on the books is about 27
28

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
million so as you me um so on page six
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
um just we're responsible for locating
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
the rifle owner of those properties um
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we are required to um publish uh or
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
to um we published this analist and uh
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the union leader every year as
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
you're probably familiar with it uh we
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
published that for two consecutive weeks
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
uh we also um required to send the same
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
listing that is reported to us from the
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
previous year uh we sent postcards to to
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
notify those um those individuals and
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
companies uh using the last known
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
address and so now uh it's becoming
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
easier to search uh to to to um to claim
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
that property and to search for the
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
property with the U with the system that
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
we're using is called uh caps and claim
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
proper system um that has provided a lot
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
of um automation to to this process and
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
so we with we have the ability um we
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
have our own website it's called find
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
New Hamshire money.gov and so when folks
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
go to that website you have the ability
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
to search property directly into our
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
database so the claims can also be
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
initiated immediately um so we've been
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
able to return more funds because of the
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
ability to to provide all these tools to
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
to individuals and companies we also
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
still have ability to use
 
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.149 align:start position:0%
still have ability to use
missingmoney.com

00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
missingmoney.com
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
and um just last year the vendor um
 
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:36.919 align:start position:0%
actually got the contract for
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
missingmoney.com the same vendor that we
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
use for our claim property system so now
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
when uh folks anywhere in the country
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
search for property using M um
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
missingmoney.com that um they are able
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
to initiate a claim um using that
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
website but it comes directly to our
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
database so again a lot of ways to two
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
automate um have occurred over the last
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
few years so in FIS year 24 we return
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 uh2 million to Citizens
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
representing about 12,000 claims um so
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
as you can see on page
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
seven the amount of claims that we've
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
been able to pay have have increased
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
over time so over the last 10 years um
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have returned about 72 72.6 million
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
to uh to owners of property and it's an
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
average of 7.2 million but again we're
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
you know over the last few years we've
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
been a to return more funds um and that
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
and that it's due again to a automation
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of um debility that most of the
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
states use the same the same software so
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
now is is uh very coordinated most of
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
the websites look the same and so if
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
there is a a claim initiated in a
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
different part of the if there is more
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
Outreach being done some other place in
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
the country then that's really connected
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
and we ended up uh return in more
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
property to to individuals and companies
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have a question representative
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious is
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
there a time certain that the state can
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
take take those uh assets does it have
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
to be a a fiveyear time period I'm just
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
curious as to what yes there is a dcy
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
period for the most part it's F most
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
property have a fiveyear dcy period so
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
if the the the holders also have the
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility to try to return that
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
property so they do um the due
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
diligences they have to do and after
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
they try all of that then they have to
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
then they report the property to us and
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
then we continue with the due due
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
diligence follow as a followup so the
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
these numbers are from uh proceeds five
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
years ago that are being put into the
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
general fund and I I guess secondarily
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
to that question is does the person
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
whose funds have been claimed have any
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
recourse after the those five years do
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
we have exposure I guess yes so the
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
quick answer is yes so anyone can come
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
at any time to to claim their property
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of the DM super and I'll
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the achievement process in a
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
minute but um so the D that I was
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
discussing previously is the amount of
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
time that the holders Banks or other
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
companies have to if they if there's no
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
activity during that time that's when
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
they report to us but then if we are
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
able to return so once this reported to
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
us if we're unable to return that
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
property to the rightful owner then 3
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
years later we as cheat that money to
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the general fund and I'll talk about
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
you so um so the last thing I'm going to
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
say on that page seven is um so there's
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
been a lot of a reach at the national
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
level and um again because of um they've
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
been um just um
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
there was a program feature on Good Good
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
Morning America so every time there's
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
some type of um um event like that then
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
our claim uh activity increases so again
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
there been a lot of our reach over the
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
last few years so that's why we've been
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
able to return more
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
funds and just most recently ourselves
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to our requirement we are
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
experimenting with um um promoting with
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
w we just um started uh putting a
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
small ad and we're we're not clear how
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to work but that's
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
something we're experimenting with to
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
try to um bring more awareness about our
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
funds so on page eight is um just start
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
discussing this this achievment process
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
and it really is it's just a basic
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
formula that is described on page eight
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so funds are remitted uh to us if
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
weren't able to claim them then after 3
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
years we start this calculations so we
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
um all the property um then we add this
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
we need to sell the Securities that we
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
receive those are the those have a um a
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
three we have to still wait three years
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
but we don't liquidate those Securities
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
until the year we are going to um uh
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
prepare the statement calculations so um
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
it is the amount remitted plus um the
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
here is that we we sell during a
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
particular fiscal year then we're able
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
to U deduct our administrative expenses
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
for the unclaimed property program and
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
we also send um funds uh to all of the
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
the counties any property that was
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
remitted that um is from um a holder in
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
in different countries U counties they
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
get um they get the proceeds the net
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
proceeds of of um of that property that
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
we were not not able to
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
return so that's really the uh
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
estatement calculation so last year we
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
were able to return we were able to was
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
cheat to the general fund $19.9 million
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
and to the Count's $1.8
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
million so page nine is just a chart of
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
the top part of the chart is um what we
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
have cheated to a general fund related
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
to property that is not
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
Securities that is we're able to we're
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
able to see how much is reported to us
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
each year so we're able to that's was
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
help us estimate this um this treatment
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
um amount that the general fund may get
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year what we are enable to
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
um but we're not able to determine right
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
away is how much is going to be the
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
Securities that we're going to liquidate
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
so the table in the bottom is uh the
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
activity related to the Securities that
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
we have um sold and the and the proceeds
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we have received that uh clearly is
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
linked to the Capital Market so it's um
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
very unpredictable to try to estimate
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
that portion of this calculation um for
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
example and um you can see again it has
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
to do with the cup the the how the stock
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
market is doing so for example in 2020
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
um that was a very um low amount that we
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
were able to achieve related to those
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
security so again it's linked to the
 
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.230 align:start position:0%
security so again it's linked to the
capital

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
markets so page 10 is really a chart of
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
what we have cheated to general fund
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
over the last 10
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
years um again because we have we've
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
been receiving more property over the
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
last few years we've been able to
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
achieve more to the general fund but in
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
general over the past five years we have
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm includ them in the bottom but um
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
I guess the one piece I want to mention
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
is this this this estimates are we use a
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
10year average to to Really um determine
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
to calculate this um these amounts um
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
the 10year average has helped us uh and
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty consistent again the P's are
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
as very un predictable as the P's
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
related to the Securities that we we
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
liquidate the other piece that is going
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
to be different too going forward is
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
again as as all this automation is
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
helping us to um receive more property
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we're able to report more
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
funds uh perhaps that Trend will change
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh but we'll keep an eye on that we'll
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor to see how that's
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
going to impact um this treatment and
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
and again how much we're able to return
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
and how much we're able to uh SG to
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
counties and the general
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
fund so in essence that's the unclaimed
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
property program and that's what the
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
revenue Source related to uh achievment
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue again this program is not really
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
designed to generate Revenue it's just
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
to stay benefits from the property that
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
we are unable to um return um again the
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
general fund benefits
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
um you know during those um years of the
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
budget um but again eventually uh owners
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
have the right to come back and and
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
request the
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
property I'll be happy to answer any
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions I have one question um so
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody didn't claim a th
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
shares of AT&amp;T stock um once it gets es
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
cheated to the state general fund what
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean you have to sell the
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
stock so that you have the cash to put
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the general fund so when we EST Che
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
to general fund we liquidate those
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
Securities so if someone comes back back
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
later years later and it has to do with
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
those Securities we just return the cash
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay the cash at the time of the value
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
at that time yes
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Spar thank
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
you chair um you mentioned in the
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
presentation cash and securities are
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
there other assets what about real
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
estate no real estate this is just
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
intangible property um so some so even
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
for example for um deposit uh boxes the
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
bank banks have they have to liquidate
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
those proceeds and if if they report
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
that to us it's going to have to be cash
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
follow follow follow is there a a
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
process for the real estate if it's not
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
claimed or
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
I would guess that towns will probably
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh have a share of sale because taxes
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
aren't being paid because most of these
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
are from people who are dece deceased
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
and then the town I guess would claim
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
those those funds and does that roll up
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
to the state or does that stay with the
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
town I'm actually not familiar with the
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
realate process this is the this chapter
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
of the law it just covers
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
you okay yes representative ORS thank
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank thank you uh on
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
the top of page 11 the first bullet All
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
State collection or concentrated funds
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
not needed for current expenses are
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
invested in accordance with so in this
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
year if we are if we do experience a
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
shortfall would some of that money be
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
used to cover the shortfall is that what
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's telling
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
me no but thank you for your question I
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
think I'll move to the to the obviously
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
the umu the interest on Surplus uh
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
presentation if that's okay with you but
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
um all this means is this is this is a
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
reference in the Statue RSA 6A just says
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
um that we I'm responsible for investing
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything that is not needed for current
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
expenses so um what what the way we
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
interpret that is we pull all our cash
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
we we are responsible for all the
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
collections for the state um and um
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're um we monitor our liquidity and
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
how much we need for example for payroll
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
um the typical expenses are you know
 
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.950 align:start position:0%
um the typical expenses are you know
Debt

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
Debt
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
Service um mmis providers that the
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers those are large
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
dispersements so anything that we don't
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
need immediately then we're able to
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
invest those funds and for that we to
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
have our investment policies that guide
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
us of how we are able to invest some of
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
those funds we still maintain some
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
liquidity um our policy for operating um
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
operating funds um allows us to go out
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
only um a year um so we have matur so we
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
have Securities are invested three
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
months 6 months N9 months 12 months um
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
so the average maturity is is is 360
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
days very good thank you thank
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
you so I think with that I'll just
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
continue with with um our cash and
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
investment activities um so um in
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
addition to um so again it's we we
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
invest of all our funds and um this
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
state has been been able to generate uh
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
significant investment income as I
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the past um but part of
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
what um and clearly when I was here um
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
last time I showed you a graph of how
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
our cash cycle has changed over time and
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
um again we've benefited from uh the
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
revenue surpluses and also the um the
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
ARA money that we still hold um so one
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
of the bullets right there is still it
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
mentions that of the 9294 million uh we
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
still have about $430 million of arpa
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
money that uh needs to be spent before
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2026 so we still invest in
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
those funds and we're benefiting from
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
from that uh but part of all of our um
 
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.829 align:start position:0%
from that uh but part of all of our um
investing

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
investing
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
um what what happens and because of the
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
way we are able to um there are some
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds there are some dedicated funds
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
that are entitled to uh receive interest
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
and what and so we so we we identify
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
those funds and even though we pull all
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
of the um our cash those um those
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds receive their interest
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
allocation and we do that calculation on
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
a corly basis so sometimes when you see
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
um if you're if you're looking at the
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
revenue focus and you see interest
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue just keep in mind that at some
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
point we're going to subtract a portion
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
that it belongs to um dedicated funds um
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
and so for the most part we pull um not
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
um not unrestrictive funds so for
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
example we we invest the turnpike funds
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
separately we invest um the srf or state
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
revolving funds separate so there's some
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
a few funds that we invest separately
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
but everything else is pulled together
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
to try to uh maximize the amount of
 
00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
interest that we
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
receive the other piece that I'm
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
mentioning here is that we subtract
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
banking investment cost from those uh
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
from those Investments so um what we
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
report on the revenue focuses the net
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
amount so again we're averaging right
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
now about $2 billion dollar in and in in
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
cash and
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
Investments and um and we also invest in
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
the the revenue stabilization the funds
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
in Revenue stabilization account so from
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
the revenue stabilization account alone
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're right now um we're project that
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have by the end of the
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year $2 million in in investment
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
income so on page 12 it just shows how
 
00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:27.510 align:start position:0%
income so on page 12 it just shows how
our

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
investment income has changed over the
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
last 10 years again the last two years
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
we be benefiting from um the amount of
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
cash that we've been holding and so last
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
year in fisure 24 the general we created
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
the general fund about $100
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
million um for fiscal year 25 the
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
picture is changing um and right now we
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate we're going to um still
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
create a general fund about $80
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
million then again because of um the
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
levels of cash we anticipate those will
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
change and also the interest rates and
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
the the yields that we're receiving also
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
are expected to decrease so in 26 and 27
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
we anticipate about again 26 about 53
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
million and in 27 41 million these
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
calculations are based on a lot of
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
assumptions uh we are um again we're
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
trying to project the the average cash
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
that we will hold over a period of again
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the next bium and then also we're trying
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to estimate the yields that you know we
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
we will have the interest rates that we
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
will have over the next two years so
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
again has a lot of assumptions and I
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
think this goes back to uh benan
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
question representa or head um when we
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
put together the projections for 24 and
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
25 uh we were probably B
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh did a really bad job uh estimating
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
our our interest but at the time we used
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
um the yields that were expected during
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
that buying was a period of time where
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
the bond market said oh I think the
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
interest rates are going to be really
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
low so it's starting decreasing so we
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
use those yields to estimate um interest
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the interest we're going to generate
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
well the the bond market was really
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
wrong the um the Federal Reserve didn't
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
um uh Cut Rate so soon so we've been
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
benefiting from those those decisions so
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
um the year that we're using right now
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
are based on the latest projections of
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
the feral Reserve but again that it's
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
also um you know subject to change
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
depend on how things um change over time
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
and and right now there's expectation
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps only two more um interest
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
rate cuts are going to happen during the
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
year but again that's just based on
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
current um
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
information so that's all I have for
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
this I'll be happy to answer additional
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how much if
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
any of the drop in projected interest
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
income is related to the loss or the the
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
end of arpa funds and uh the interest in
 
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.150 align:start position:0%
end of arpa funds and uh the interest in
dividends

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
tax the interest and dividend
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
Stacks I think It's a combination of
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
everything it really is um the pro
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
trying to project how much cash we're
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to have over the next three two
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
years for the bium 26 27 um I had to
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that we're receiving
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
less revenues in general not necessarily
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend STX but in total
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues that the state expects
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
to collect um so um based on the way the
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
cash is changing right now again and
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
less revenues expenditures have
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
increased over the last couple of years
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
so just based on that math um we've seen
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
a decrease of about 15% year-over-year
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
of our cash so we just try so I continue
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
to project it that way assuming we will
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
continue to decrease it that way of
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
course we may receive more Revenue so
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the expenditures will um again
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
will freeze there will be some measures
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
that you know at the end we need to have
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
a BAL balanced budget so perhaps the
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
depleting 50% of our our cash is not
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
realistic but I'm trying to be
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
conservative so that's that's what we
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
used in this this
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
assumptions um the arpa money again as
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
part of the for as part of the equation
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
we are expected to spend all those
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
monies by the end of 2026 so it's all
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
part of again the decrease in average
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
cash balance position that we will have
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
me I'm not really sure how to ask this
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
question but on the amount
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
of interest on double more doubled in in
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
fy19 and I'm wondering if that's related
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the first tax and cuts and jobs act
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
which dumped a whole lot of money in 18
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
into uh the largest
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
corporations that is correct represent
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
me during that time we we our cash had
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
increasing we received more revenues
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
during that time so we had the ability
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh for the first time to start investing
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh for for many years the state we just
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
had to maintain um what we call this um
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
compensating balances just to make sure
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
we had enough balances in our bank
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
accounts to to to um to cover banking
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
cost so for the longest time that that
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
was a treasury strategy so during that
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
year that was the first time after
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
several years that the state that the
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
treasury started invest in funds because
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
of the additional Revenue that we
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
received during that period of
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
yery thank you for taking my
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
question you just stated that you
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate um General clining revenues
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
board um not just from uh interest and
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
dividends but from other sources as
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
well how much of a factor is the um
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
increased M2 Supply um have on reducing
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
the value of the individual dollars thus
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
inflating numbers all the way around
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
when in fact the value correlation
 
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.270 align:start position:0%
when in fact the value correlation
remains

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
remains
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
Equitable or equal or similar is
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
comparison inflation so um inflation
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
definitely impacts again the the revenue
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
that we receive and and um in in
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
including the interest rates that we're
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
earning right so these are not real or
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're starting to have a real positive
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
rate finally um because of the interest
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
rates that were that were increasing so
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it relates to the um amount
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
of cash that is out there um there's
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot of um cash and just
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
like mutual funds have benefited um and
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and companies have benefit
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
from the from the fact that all of this
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
money that was um you know the mutual
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
funds are holding right now but um
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's beginning to decrease um and the
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
revenues is really what we've seen again
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
in this fisal year is just the the the
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
fact that the some of the revenues are
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
not performing the way uh we would like
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
them to perform I think it was expected
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
that they were going to um normalize at
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
some point so that's what we're seeing
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
right now um but I'm not sure it has to
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
do with the amount of cash that is out
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
there um hopefully that helps a little
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank other questions chair
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative SP thank you um is uh
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
what is the investment objective of the
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
funds uh that are that we have thank you
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
for the question yes um so our invest
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
our objectives are very simple again
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
this are operating funds for the most
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
part and so it's um uh safety liquidity
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
and maximizing um rate of return so we
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
we essentially our strategy is to um
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
invest in in Securities and and funds
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
are extremely safe like us treasuries
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
and um feral agencies um investment um
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
investment credit um and so that's
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's really our priority to make sure
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
that we are able to meet again safety
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
and liquidity are our our main priority
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
followup followup follow um what are
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
your thoughts then on non Fiat based
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
currency as far as uh investing in
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
that it's um it's it's complicated it's
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
not something we probably um are able to
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
do that right now again we're we're
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
um my responsibility is to meet current
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
expenses and then if we're able to
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
generate some investment income that's
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
what we're doing um I know there is some
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
um some proposals to um try to invest in
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
in in other um instruments crypto
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
that is not something that I could
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
utilize for this type of monies um some
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
of there's a lot of volatility on in
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
those Securities or those um um I guess
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call them Securities right
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
now and there's a lot of volatility so
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
do do they do they do not they're not
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
part they wouldn't be part of a strategy
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
for our operating funds that you know
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
for with such volatility um you will
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
have to have the ability to hold um
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
funds for a very long period of time to
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh tolerate um again that
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
volatility thank you you're
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
welcome yes representative shamber thank
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you madam treasurer
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
for taking this question
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh is your department fully staffed or
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
any positions that need to be uh staffed
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
so that you can operate the way that you
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
should for the
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
state thank you for the question uh
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
right now I have one vacancy um it is in
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
a vandom property um uh vacancy so we're
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
working on trying to there's a higher
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
and freeze right now but we we think we
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
could um could utilize the waiver
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
process to be able to fill that position
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
um in terms of if I need if I have what
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
I need um for the treasury we're a very
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh very lean agency we could benefit
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
from uh additional Personnel but that's
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
something I'm um again exploring um more
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
than anything what we want to find as
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
efficiencies within our department
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
within our processes uh try to automate
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
as much as possible we are uh with um
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
the controller is very familiar with the
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
process of the the fact that the New
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the accounting system is
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
being upgraded so we're trying to
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
utilize um all of the new functionality
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
that um is coming with that upgrade so
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
once we um able to uh optimize all of
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
those pieces says then I need to see if
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
I need additional Personnel but thank
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%

shaking I thought it had to do with the

numbers but actually it was the actual
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%

related unrestricted General Revenue uh
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%

27 uh to provide you just with a brief
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
overview and directing you to page two
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh presentation packet um I've
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
outlined uh for you uh the major uh
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
functions of the bureau uh and they
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%

broker dealers and investment advisors
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
as well as their agents uh there really
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
is a really significant population which
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll mention in just a a few
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
seconds uh in terms of this regulated
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
area we're also responsible for the
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
registration of Securities that are
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
offered and sold in in New Hampshire
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for the regular
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
inspection or one may call audit of
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
broker dealer offices and investment

throughout the state of of New Hampshire
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
investor education is a large component
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
of what we do in terms of reaching out
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%

uh programming uh promoting safe
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
investing and perhaps the most
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
significant portion and activity of the
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
bureau is directed to enforcement
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
related activities this includes uh uh
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%

01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation any any any number of
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement related activities um uh
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh or events that may have
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
occurred uh in the state um uh and filed
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
with our office as you'll notice on on
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
page three this provides a uh a brief
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
snapshot of our overall licensing
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
activity in New Hampshire and as you'll
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
see this is as of January 1 of this year
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
161,50 licensed broker dealer agents in
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh which is really a
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
sizable number they are not all located
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire approximately 2
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
200 R but that is the population of
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives that are licensed to
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
solicit into New Hampshire and offer uh
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
Securities products we have uh uh
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
2,847 investment advisor firms as well
 
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.829 align:start position:0%
2,847 investment advisor firms as well
as

01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
5,670 invest investment advisor
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives offered uh that are
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
licensed to offer their services and we
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
register in excess of 29,000 Securities
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
products uh that is products sold uh in
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire of of that 29,000
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 15,000 are mutual fund
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
registrations and I'll talk just briefly
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
about those because that has a direct
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
impact uh on uh the bureau's uh
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue referring you to the uh to the
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
next slide uh as you'll see the bureau
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
is also responsible for re overseeing
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
you the uh Branch offices of investment
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
advisors and branch and broker dealer
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives so uh we conduct uh uh
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
reviews audits of those branch office
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
locations on an unannounced basis uh
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're done and selected based on a
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
risk-based uh schedule and and formula
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we have so we're identifying those
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
that we believe really need to be
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed and those who uh operate uh you
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
know very much within compliance we'll
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
see them less frequently but they are
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
done on an unannounced basis uh by our
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
our audit
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
team you'll um also note on the next
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
slide that uh as far as our enforcement
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
activity that we handle uh roughly 70
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
complaints annually now it may not
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily sound like a a large number
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to Securities related
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
complaints they're really quite
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
extensive in in in terms of review of of
 
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.070 align:start position:0%
extensive in in in terms of review of of
the

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
Securities activity occurring in those
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
accounts very intensive type
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
investigations of which approximately 40
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh may eventually evolve to an
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement action by our enforcement
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
team and enforcement lawyers and
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
actually even go to a full hearing which
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
is a full you know administrative
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and they do have a right of
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
Court on on any decision uh that we do
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
render but I think most importantly what
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
we do on the enforcement side and
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually the overall Bureau is to
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
provide information and direction to the
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
investing public uh we receive a a wide
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
variety of calls each and every day uh
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions about their brokerage account
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
or something that may have occurred with
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
their investment advisor or particular
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
solicitation that's going on we know
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
that there's all kinds of uh
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
solicitations going on from unregistered
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
people scam artists essentially and so
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
people call our office which we really
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
do like because uh that's one way which
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
we're able to convey to them other than
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
through our investor education the the
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
types of scams and misrepresentation
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's going on in the state so reaching
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
out to the public is really a really
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
critical function of the
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
bureau however on on the revenue side
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
that is equally uh as as critical uh and
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
important to us because uh for for one
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh for one matter uh and I should point
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
out that the Bureau of Securities is um
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
a self-funded agency meaning that uh and
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
as you know uh our our budget is not
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
derived from uh general fund
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general fund Revenue but
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
rather it's through fines and penalties
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the bureau may receive as a result
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
of its enforcement actions uh so uh
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're able to uh keep the lights
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
on uh operate the bureau uh exclusively
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
through that means and also more
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
importantly is that our investor
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
education Outreach is funded as a result
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
of the fines and penalties that we
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
impose on those that actually break the
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
law so it it really does work out work
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
out well referring to the the very last
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
page as far as our revenue and certainly
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the most important information for for
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
this committee uh I thought i' just kind
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
of described the the two basic areas
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
where where we receive uh uh funding uh
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
through our licensing uh process uh
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
again directing you to that that page
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that uh revenue is derived
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
through broker dealer and investment
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
advisor uh licensing fees and then the
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
second component is through Securities
 
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.590 align:start position:0%
second component is through Securities
product

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
registrations last year uh fiscal year
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
2024 the bureau gen generated 21.6
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
million in firm licensing fees and 22.3
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
million in Securities product
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
registration fees so that all totaled
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
for $ 43.9 million in unrestricted
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue I would ask that
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
you not necessarily be armed uh by our
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
current uh 2025 year-to-date uh numbers
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh as it shows only currently 2.7
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
million uh in broker dealer and
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
investment advisor fees uh the uh vast
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
majority of our of our licensing like
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
broker dealer and investment licensure
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
fees uh arrive in January uh so you will
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
see that increase the January number
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
increased by 17.6 million uh come
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
February 1 and we'll report that to you
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have us back later on uh in in the
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the coming
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
months a majority of our Securities
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
registrations uh include mutual funds as
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
I mentioned
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
before those renew annually
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
approximately during the that revenue is
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
received during the months of April and
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
May uh of each year so that number that
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
you see there will increase considerably
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh during the uh last fiscal uh last
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of the fiscal year however uh
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and I think as you look at the
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
Securities registration fees you will
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
see that the fees seem to slightly
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
contract uh each year and they have not
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
increased at the same level as firm and
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
agent licensing fees and this is largely
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
due to the um contraction and
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
consolidation of mutual fund families
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
now I had had the opportunity to testify
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
before the committee here I think three
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
or four years ago and I first mentioned
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
this concept that the federal government
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
was and and the SEC was promulgating
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
called regulation best interest and what
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
that regulation involves is that
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
whatever products or services that are
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
being provided to a Securities client
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
that it has to be in the best interest
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
of that client now the impact there on
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
mutual fund registration fees in our
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
revenue is that mutual fund companies
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
have had to look at their portfolios
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
examine those funds and determine
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not those mutual funds are
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
really in the best interest of their
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
clients what fund companies have
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
realized and what we as regulators and
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the FED federal government has also
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
realized is that some of these uh mutual
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
funds have really high fees and so uh
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
fund companies have looked at those
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
funds and determined that well we can
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
offer that product at a lower price to
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
Consumers and as a result the uh they
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a limit ated some of their higher
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
priced funds and I'm speaking just
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
generally but that's been my observation
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
that they've reduced that number and as
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
a result that has reduced the revenues
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
of mutual funds so as it impacts the
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
bureau and as you can see in my
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
projections that we'll see a decrease uh
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
for 2025 and I believe it will level off
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
because fund companies will have
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
concluded their reviews in terms of
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of mutual funds so
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
we'll see that Revenue I believe I have
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
it somewhere in the area of of 22
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
million um going forward into uh 2026
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
and 2027 20 2 2,200,000 that could
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
increase but I I'm I'm pretty confident
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
that we will see that level uh so I'm
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
not so terribly concerned however on the
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
other side broker dealers and investment
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
advisers that population just continues
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
to grow year-over year uh as people get
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
more and more into the market and so
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'll see revenues there uh I believe uh
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
will increase uh over over the coming
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
years so that is the financial picture
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the Bureau of Securities regulation
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair would be more than happy to
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you do we
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
have yes representative
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
Malloy thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question this has to do with
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement and I'm uh when you say
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
an average of 70 complaints or
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
investigations annually is this mostly
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
about fraud or of some kind of and I
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
have a followup uh thank you very much
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
for the question representative uh yes
 
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.430 align:start position:0%
for the question representative uh yes
uh

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation and misre
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation uh can take any number
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
of forms uh it it could be the outright
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh misrepresentation of the product uh
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
to the client to the customer uh it
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
could also be uh what we see a great
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
deal of unlicensed activity fraud in the
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
sale where the person is not registered
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
licensed to sell Securities yet holds
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
thems themselves out as as some form of
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
expert uh and then presents the product
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
unlicensed activity is a real issue okay
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
up the reason I ask that is because I'm
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
an arbitrator with finro oh and all
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
right uh it sounds to me like that what
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is taken care of
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
before it gets to a a finra level or is
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
it the other way around um the the Cent
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
Cent um it's it's interesting uh that
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
that you ask that question uh when it
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
comes to complaints a complaintant a
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
person who has an issue with a with a
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
broker dealer uh representative has a
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
couple Avenues to follow um if they want
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
if they want to take that particular
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
complaint to arbitration and before you
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh they're certainly entitled to do that
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
in fact a lot of The Brokerage contracts
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
require if that if there is a dispute
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
that they go to arbitration so they will
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
go to you uh a complainant can also come
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire and to the
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
bureau and file a complaint if they're
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based advisor or if the
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
person one of that 167,000
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh called into the state
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire New Hampshire has
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over that matter uh so we
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
will receive that complaint and act on
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
it uh so they they have they have
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
options thank you represent shamberg
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
taking this question you said you're
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded on fine and
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
penalties what if just what if because
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen but what if
 
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
no regulation violations for the entire
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
year do you have a cash Reserve
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere that uh we do uh there is as I
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
I believe uh former Secretary of State
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
Gardner addressed that issue when when
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau was first transferred uh from
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
insurance to the Attorney General's
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
office and then to the Secretary of
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
State's office that there is a a
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
holdback amount I believe it's 675,000
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh which will allow us to operate for at
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
least 6 months or thereabouts uh into
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year uh
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
however um having been with the Bureau
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
for a couple decades now we've never
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
experienced that and and I have to knock
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
on wood as my mom would say uh that it
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
will will not occur and the reason why I
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
believe it representative will not occur
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
is that unfortunately the the the amount
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
of fraud cases that that we receive or
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
just the overall fraudulent activity in
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is non-stop uh New
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a bit of a Target uh and
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of good reasons number one
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
we are an older community in terms of
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
median age second oldest next next to
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
Maine um uh New Hampshire has a number
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
of retirees who have a lifetime of
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
assets and therefore they are the target
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
of of fraudulent activity and they are
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
being reached in a variety of ways
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
through the mails but more so on the
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
Internet by way of telephone inperson so
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
it's it seems like it's a constant
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair follow up on your
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Securities regulations you say
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
have over 900 locations in New Hampshire
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
can you explain I mean just 900 offices
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
or do you lease or do you rent or what
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
do you do I'm sorry I I wasn't clear on
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
that point when I say 900 offices those
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
are the branch offices of broker dealers
 
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
and investment advisors uh that that
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
that operate some operate from their
 
01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.149 align:start position:0%
that operate some operate from their
home

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh when co uh hit uh a number of Branch
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
offices allowed their representatives to
 
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
move to their home so we'll actually
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
conduct an exam
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
there just looking at your Revenue
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
history speaking of of that I mean it's
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
it's very consistent I mean it's it's
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
between 42 42 and 44 million roughly
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
over the last five years so I mean and
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
then your estimates your estimates go up
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
slightly but it looks uh very consistent
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
which that's his historically something
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
you've witnessed yes that that is
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
correct I we do hope that you know they
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
will continue to increase and as I had
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned I would attribute that to uh
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
broker dealer and investment advisor
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
activity always expanding always
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
expanding right any other
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
before we get to the uh judicial branch
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to hear from uh they're
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
not they're not quite here yet they're
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
not here yet okay hopefully they come in
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
shortly okay so I just wanted to take a
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
minute especially for members who
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
haven't been through this process before
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're getting lots of paper tossed at
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
you lots of numbers and figures and
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
information and some of it can be pretty
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelming you're probably wondering
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
what am I doing with all this one thing
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is take the numbers that
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
you're getting and put them in that
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
worksheet that I presented to you last
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
week as part of my packet so there'll be
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
an Excel sheet that I will P hand out to
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
the members um sometime later this week
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
you'll get a get an email from me that
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
would have that in it um anybody who
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
came before you today with any of their
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
estimates for 25 26 and 27 I would
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
include into that document so it starts
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
to pull pull things into a single place
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
for you um if there's any questions that
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
you have you know after you've kind of
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
listened to the agencies or um you look
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
at the materials feel free to let me
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
know or let the chair know and he can
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
let me know um and then we can chase
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
those down for you as well um I believe
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
the chair is planned next Monday to have
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the agencies come in
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
which would be um Health and Human
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
Services Department of Safety Department
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
of Transportation the Department of
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
Justice to talk about tobacco settlement
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and Liquor Commission so they will all
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
come in next week and then the week
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
after that is when you'll have the the
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
big hitter back of Dr to talk about
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
estimates to all the various Revenue
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
sources that they collect um um that
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
she's the commissioner spoke to last
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
last week and the week before so I just
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
again wanted to take a minute um because
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to keep getting these
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
documents you're going to get emails and
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
you just to help you understand what
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
what happens with the
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
information yes and and what Chris is
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
putting together for us is invaluable
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would be going through each
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
of these handouts that we're getting
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
over the past few days and trying to
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the revenue uh for
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
each Chris will put that all into an
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
Excel spreadsheet which makes it much
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
easier of course you can always refer
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
back to the handouts for for additional
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
information but yeah the what Chris is
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
doing is invaluable for us uh any
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
questions about that for Chris of course
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
he's he's he's always available well I
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say always available but he's
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
available if there's other
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
um follow-ups but um happy people
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
stopped by the office or send me an
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
email and um you'll get a response back
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
from me so thank you yeah
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
yes you don't just work for this
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee or finance committee or the
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
house you also do the Senate and the
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
executive branches is that correct uh
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
not the executive branch but we do the
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and we work for we're
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
non-partisans so we work for everybody
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
and we are assigned to the finance
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee and that we do the ways and
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
means estimates um for the Senate and
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
the house um as well as I do the capital
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
budget so I'll be next door um fairly
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
soon in the next couple of weeks you'll
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
see me maybe bouncing out of here to run
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
next door to help them with some things
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
just modifying you're always
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
available well I I said he was always
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
available well then I corrected myself I
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
just said he's available no I
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't others that may think they could
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
just block in all right thank you Chris
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
I hope the judish will be here shortly
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
um they they were told to be here or
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
asked to be here you know if they could
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
be 10 minutes early but it may be
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
actually while while I have a minute
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
here and before sirl leaves uh let me
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
just mention that um and I I'll probably
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
mention this at the end again I suppose
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
but um just in case people should leave
 
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh earlier um next week obviously is
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
not what's uh yeah next week's not in
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
the calendar yet uh next week I think
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the week after so that would be um I
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
should I should look at a calendar
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
here no no I mean an actual
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
calendar third next week week after the
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
10th 10th okay so I'm right now I am
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that both those weeks we may
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
need to meet three days we may need to
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
meet Monday Tuesday and
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
um the the reason for that is that um
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
unlike some committees that are are just
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
working on bills we are working on
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and bills uh in the
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
first year of our bium second year bium
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know we'll only address the revenues
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
if if they seem like they're way off
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
from where we expected and therefore
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll just be working on bills but I
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
think we need and and the reason for the
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
three days is that um the governor's
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
um budget will be presented do we I
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have a date yet it's
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
February 13th or 14th somewhere in there
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
or 12 somewhere between the 12th and the
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
14th so we need to um we'll need to get
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
ours out shortly after that and to be in
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
a position to do that and to work on
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
some bills at the same time the only way
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%

courts they are mandatory to go to the
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%

Corrections does that money show up in
the

01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
corrections on revenues rather than in
 
01:35:07.199 --> 01:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
corrections on revenues rather than in
the

01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
courts I'll have to get back to you on
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
that um because that's what happens with
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety once yeah um let me
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
double check with you I I know we get a
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
report on what they collect but whether
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
or not it shows up for us collecting it
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
or them I'm not sure but either way it
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
you and then penalty assessments um as I
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're levied on fines for
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses motor vehicle
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
violations um violations of Municipal
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
ordinances and it's currently $2 or 24%
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the fine I've never seen a $2 charge
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
so that's usually 24% of the fine um and
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
that means if you got a $100 fine you'd
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
actually be paying
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
$124 they're tracked separately
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
obviously the $100 goes in the fine
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
bucket that goes to the general fund the
 
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
$24 is now in the penalty assessment
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
Lane and that gets split three different
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
ways So currently with penalty
 
01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.030 align:start position:0%
ways So currently with penalty
assessments

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
2third of the amount goes to the general
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
fund um prior to that time it had been
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
deposited with police standards and
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
training they now get General eneral
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
funds instead and we deposit this to the
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
general fund the remaining um 1/3 is
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually split sixth to the Department
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
of Justice's victims assistance fund and
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
the other one six goes to the um the
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
judicial Branch's it dedicated fund both
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
funds in terms of collections we have a
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry have a question repres El same
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%

yes in terms of the collection of fines
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
M vehicle fines are defaulted through
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
the department of safety they send a
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
warning notice to the individual um if
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
the fine remains unpaid their license
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
and registration are suspended we have
 
01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:27.159 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with some states so that we
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
can track people who don't pay these
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
fines um and then we also collect a $50
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
administration fee when the fine is paid
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
to the general
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%

01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
fees that we collect are entry fees and
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
they are set forth by Court rule so the
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
court determines the amounts not um not
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and they range um from $45
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
to $225
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
depending and there landlord tenant
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
claims small claims family
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
civil and the distribution of Entry fees
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
though is set by Statute so we set the
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
amounts but the distribution of those
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
Amounts is set in statute and currently
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
64% of Entry fees are deposited to the
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
general fund and the balance um are
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
deposited into restricted funds that the
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
judicial branch holds 30% of it into our
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
it dedicated fund and 6% to the
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
facilities escros
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
fund and judges May wave uh filing
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
fees if they feel the person is UN
 
01:38:49.229 --> 01:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
fee and then we have a you'll see the
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
category of costs on on the following
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
slide but the majority of the revenues
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
in the other fees revenue is made up of
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
Records research fees conducted by the
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court 100% of that Revenue goes
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
to the general fund the fee is for
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
electronic searches and it's currently
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
$20 per name for the first five names
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
and then $5 per name for each additional
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
name and motions and petitions also make
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
up other fees and those fees range from
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
$25 to
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
$250 um in terms of other fees I would
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
say um the records research fees makes
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
up the bulk of it probably around 70 to
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
75% of what we collected it's in the $8
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
million range in that category of
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
fee a $25 sear charge is added to some
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
cases but not to others um so it's not
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
added in criminal cases juvenile DV
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
stocking small claims that type of thing
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
and again if there is a payment plan to
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
be set up we charge a setup fee of $25
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
so and the next slide is a a broader
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
history of the unrestricted revenues
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the courts have collected um since
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
2017 up through uh fiscal year 2024
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
actual and the other fees is probably
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
the only category where we've seen a
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
steady increase um that's of a
 
01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:17.950 align:start position:0%
steady increase um that's of a
significant

01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
amount um default fees collected by
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
safety have steadily declined um um and
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
I think you see that also reflected in
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
the highway fund motor vehicle amounts
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
that have just uh decreased over the
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
years I think part of that um is due to
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
the T pandemic we have more work from
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
home um the default fees that the courts
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
collect um you saw an increase and then
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
we've sort of seen a steady decline
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
since fiscal year 2022 and I think part
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
of that is attributable to the fact that
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
the courts are making more efforts use
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
technology to remind people when they
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to show up to court we send them
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
text messages now the more they remember
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
the less they're going to be defaulted
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we see a decline uh in that Revenue
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
stream as a result of trying to be more
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
proactive and getting them to appear in
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
court um does anyone have any questions
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
slide representative ORS thank you Mr
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um sorry I missed what category
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
was that last one you were speaking to
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the decline oh I was talking about
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
um default fees collected by the courts
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
so you see if you that's like the fourth
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
one down from the bottom I see yeah you
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
see it kind of it went up for a while
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
but then it's sort of been steady
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
2022 thank
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
you any other no no other
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
questions and then the following slide
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
focuses more on recent activities so we
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
have fiscal year 2024 actual what we've
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
recognized through December 31 of this
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year what we're projecting for
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
the second half of this fiscal year and
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
then what we're projecting for 26 and 27
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
based on what we've seen in the last few
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
years so unfortunately it's not showing
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh an expectation of much of an increase
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
um pretty much holding steady I think um
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
with what we've seen over the last
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the following slide to the extent
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's helpful gives a more detailed
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
description of what is in each of these
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh categories of fines and
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
fees and then the last slide is uh who
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
to contact if you have any
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
questions any other
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Spar your
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
projections are basically saying it's
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
flat uh how many of these fees are um
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
how are these fees um uh increased is it
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process or is it
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
done internally right the fees
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
themselves are well we're not talking
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
fines now we're talking fees those are
 
01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:06.679 align:start position:0%
set by the court so we have depending
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
upon the type of thing that you're doing
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
whatever motion you want to have the
 
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
court here there is a fee associated
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
with it and the court sets those the
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
last time the court increased those fees
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
um and mass was fiscal year
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
2013 so it's been a while but what we
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
find too is the more you increase these
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
fees the less people you know do some of
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
these because it becomes cost
 
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
prohibitive so we try to strike a
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
balance between what we think people can
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
charge question represent I just I have
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
it you're talking about the New
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court sits the fees or
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
is it the
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
court of jurisdiction itself that sets
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
the fees
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
no I think this well I think the Supreme
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
Court has to bless it so you know they
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the Circuit Court would
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
obviously be best to know what its fees
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
are um but I don't think it does it in a
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
vacuum there is a process by which these
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
approved anything else any other
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.430 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
you Chris are you gonna have Chris you
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
gonna have something else for us or are
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
you uh yes
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to um respond to
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
represent aly's question around the
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
corrections collecting Revenue that gets
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
bucketed in with other Revenue that was
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier this morning so
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
that gets deposited it's one of the 200
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
um various Revenue sources that you see
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
there the other piece I wanted to um
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
mention to you as well is when you look
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
at the courts the page 11 so
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
the starts with the numbers there's a
 
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
line called penalty assessment just
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
before the blue line
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
when you do your Revenue estimates we're
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
going to back that number out because
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
that number is already included in the
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
other Revenue category so penalty
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
assessment comes from the courts and it
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
comes from a department of safety for
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
years it was used to fund the police
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
Council about three or four budgets ago
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
it became a general fund Source because
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't generating enough fee Revenue
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
to support the council's activities when
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
they did that um it was set up as kind
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
of a separate flow in and not included
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
as Court Revenue so we continue to back
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
that out so you have a better picture of
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
what's truly going to come from the
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
courts directly versus what's going to
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
show up in the other Revenue category so
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure the committee
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
understood that and if you had any
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
questions that well Donna was here I
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
this thank you Chris oh do you have a
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
question representative shamber yes
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman back to the
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
setting the the fees again is it based
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
upon the Court's operating
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
costs that the fee is raised or or uh
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh fuel lights things like this
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:46:43.589 --> 01:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.599 --> 01:46:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah as I said the last time it was
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
done was in fiscal year
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
2013 and really those entry fees deposit
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
to the general fund so it's not like we
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
keep that money and you know for
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves and say it offset some of our
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
other expenses we the courts are
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
primarily generally funded and I think
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
most of it comes from property tax
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
revenue I believe so there isn't a
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
direct relationship between saying we'll
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
collect this money too it will help our
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
way representa
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
elme thank you how does that come from
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
property tax Revenue Oh I thought it
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
unrestricted oh un I guess it's
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue yeah yeah and we also receive $2
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
followup I just asking Tom thank you
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
chair um who's uh pushing the courts who
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
who at the courts determin the fees or
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
who's who how's that process worked you
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm not involved in setting those
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
fees um so I don't really know um I
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
believe it would be um the
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
administrative judges and the
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
administrative heads of the circuit
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
court and Superior Court having
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you but I I'll try to
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%

question okay it's a comment all right
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
on there were a period of about four
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
terms when the state senate decided to
 
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
put up the amount of money that the
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
courts were going to bring in every year
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
and every year it didn't
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
happen on the courts are looking at what
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
the people that they're work
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
on adjudicating against or whatever I
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%

03:04:26.670 --> 03:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
usually hanging out with your colleagues
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
over in house Commerce dealing with our
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
policy issues but obviously we have a
 
03:04:33.710 --> 03:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
great deal of respect for the work that
 
03:04:36.030 --> 03:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
you all have to do particularly as it
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
pertains to the insurance premium tax
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
which is the obvious reason that we are
 
03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:42.110 align:start position:0%
which is the obvious reason that we are
here

03:04:42.110 --> 03:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
today I hope all of you have the
 
03:04:46.830 --> 03:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
presentation that we put together for
 
03:04:49.590 --> 03:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
you I was very remiss and neglecting to
 
03:04:51.309 --> 03:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
also introduce Jennifer Smith our
 
03:04:53.150 --> 03:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislative director she did a great job
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
of putting these materials together with
 
03:04:59.070 --> 03:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
the team so I'm going to follow along
 
03:05:01.870 --> 03:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
with the presentation we will obviously
 
03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
divert from that when key points come up
 
03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully we've left plenty of
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
time at the end for any questions that
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
you might have so very briefly a bit of
 
03:05:13.190 --> 03:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
background of the New Hampshire
 
03:05:15.070 --> 03:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department so the Department's
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
mission is to promote the public good by
 
03:05:19.630 --> 03:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring the existence of a safe and
 
03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
competitive Insurance Marketplace
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
through the development and enforcement
 
03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire insurance laws and I
 
03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
would mention administrative rules as
 
03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
part of that as well and we are
 
03:05:31.150 --> 03:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
committed to doing that work in an
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
honest effective and timely manner the
 
03:05:35.469 --> 03:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
department as you may know is a
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency we are funded via an
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
assessment to the insurance carriers who
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
are doing business in the state of New
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that assessment is levied on a
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
per capita of the premium that that
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
particular company writes in New
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so as you might imagine there
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
are some companies that are paying more
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
in that assessment than
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
others the New Hampshire insurance
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
department was established in
 
03:06:03.870 --> 03:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
1851 it was the first insurance
 
03:06:07.150 --> 03:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
department established in America so the
 
03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
next time you are over at The Barley
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
House for trivia night you will now know
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
where the first insurance department was
 
03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
established right here in New Hampshire
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
in 185
 
03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
in 185
1

03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
1
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
barlin I don't know back in the
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
day back in the day they used to have
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
the trivia and I don't know you guys
 
03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
know that better than I do at this point
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
but in any event the next point on the
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
slide there is obviously where the
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
insurance laws for the state are housed
 
03:06:41.070 --> 03:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
codified through RSA 400 through RSA
 
03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:43.229 align:start position:0%
codified through RSA 400 through RSA
420

03:06:43.229 --> 03:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
420
 
03:06:46.429 --> 03:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
Q I am tasked as insurance commissioner
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
with the enforcement of the insurance
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
laws of the state and that includes the
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
collection of the insurance premium
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxes fees and regulation of all
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies producers and
 
03:07:00.910 --> 03:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
adjusters producers by the way is a
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
Brokers so a brief overview of the
 
03:07:12.950 --> 03:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
various units within our department
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
again we've tried to make sure that
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
we've highlighted the ones that directly
 
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
pertain to the revenues that the
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
department brings in so we license all
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
of the companies producers as I've said
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
which is a nice term for agents and
 
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as adjusters and other
 
03:07:32.030 --> 03:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
insurance entities including tpas that
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
are doing business in New Hampshire so
 
03:07:38.429 --> 03:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
our licensing unit handles that we also
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
review forms and rates we approve or not
 
03:07:45.389 --> 03:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
approve policy rates and forms much of
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
that is influenced by what is happening
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
in the insurance Market we're going to
 
03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
talk a pretty good amount about that
 
03:07:55.110 --> 03:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
today it's important to note at this
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
point to kind of set
 
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
expectations people think that I have a
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more power than I actually do
 
03:08:05.469 --> 03:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
I do not as insurance commissioner have
 
03:08:09.550 --> 03:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to disallow a company's rate
 
03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
simply because I do not like it our
 
03:08:15.910 --> 03:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
actuaries assess rates looking through
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
two specific tests
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
first is are the rates actuarially sound
 
03:08:24.429 --> 03:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
which is to say are they appropriate for
 
03:08:26.550 --> 03:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
that company to be able to pay claims
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
and to remain financially healthy so
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to avoid there is a
 
03:08:33.790 --> 03:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
company coming in and attempting to
 
03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
undercut a market by coming in with
 
03:08:39.630 --> 03:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
artificially low premiums which again
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
leads to financial distress for that
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
company inability to pay claims and then
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately for there to potentially be
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
sticker shock to the consumer when in
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the next year they come up for Renewal
 
03:08:54.269 --> 03:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
and their nice low premium is now
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
significantly higher because they've
 
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
drawn these people in with artificially
 
03:09:00.070 --> 03:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
low rates and now they're getting
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
whacked the other test that we consider
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
is whether or not or not they are
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and I think that you all
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
can imagine the types of things that
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so I do not have the
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
ability to say I don't like XY or Z's
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
premiums because they're up whatever
 
03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
percent we here in New Hampshire have a
 
03:09:23.070 --> 03:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
very competitive
 
03:09:25.630 --> 03:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
Marketplace we expect that the free
 
03:09:29.070 --> 03:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
market system will address if a company
 
03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
wants to come forward with a 40% rate
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
increase the people who do business with
 
03:09:36.750 --> 03:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
that company are going to look at that
 
03:09:39.309 --> 03:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
and think to themselves it's probably a
 
03:09:41.790 --> 03:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
good time for me to shop my coverage and
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
so those consumers will migrate to a
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
different company who has more
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
affordable more appropriate
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
rates we also provide U Market oversight
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
so again our financial analysis our
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
financial regulation unit looks to
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that the companies are
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
financially healthy obvious reason for
 
03:10:03.790 --> 03:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
that is it's difficult for an insurance
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
company to pay claims if they're
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
bankrupt so we make sure that they do
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
not do that we also provide a market
 
03:10:13.750 --> 03:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
conduct analysis and examination of how
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
the companies are operating in New
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire two broad categories of that
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
property in casualty and life and health
 
03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
again those are very very broad
 
03:10:27.229 --> 03:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
categories of products but in each of
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
those units there's a a market conduct
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
team that will actually go in when
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
there's an examination embed themselves
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
into that company review files for that
 
03:10:41.309 --> 03:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
company with an eye towards whatever
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue it is that we are examining
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
they'll go through make notes of all of
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
the violations of state law
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
at the end of that we not only Bill them
 
03:10:51.550 --> 03:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
for the pleasure of our company for
 
03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
having conducted that exam but then
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
there'll obviously be a fine or some
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
sort of accountability for the
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
violations that were found and then
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
there'll be a corrective action plan the
 
03:11:04.750 --> 03:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
market conduct exam is truly the big
 
03:11:07.790 --> 03:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
bazooka regulatory tool that my
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
department has to bring to bear to
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that companies are in compliance
 
03:11:13.469 --> 03:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
law we also investigate and prosecute
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
and insurance
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
fraud again in case you're curious the
 
03:11:23.309 --> 03:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
most common type of insurance fraud that
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
takes place is when people choose not to
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
have Auto coverage they get into a car
 
03:11:31.269 --> 03:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
accident and then they try to get
 
03:11:34.269 --> 03:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
themselves a policy that will cover the
 
03:11:35.710 --> 03:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
accident that took place when they
 
03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have coverage my team is
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly talented and skilled at
 
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
snuffing that kind of thing out so
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
please don't do it encourage your
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
constituents not to do it we will find
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
out about it and it's not a pleasant
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
experience for them we also do
 
03:11:54.469 --> 03:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement so
 
03:11:57.870 --> 03:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
I present it this way the Fraud Unit
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
looks at um illegal actions that are
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
being taken by the public against
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
industry the enforcement unit looks at
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
the industry not following the law uh
 
03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
against the public and a lot of what
 
03:12:12.469 --> 03:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement looks at are those producers
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
are those agents agencies and brokers
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
who are not doing what they're supposed
 
03:12:18.750 --> 03:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
to do individuals within insurance
 
03:12:20.349 --> 03:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
companies again who are not doing what
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do so they will
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
launch investigations into that and
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
there are oftentimes fines associated
 
03:12:28.590 --> 03:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
with those
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
violations we also conduct public
 
03:12:32.670 --> 03:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
hearings the most prominent of which
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
include our workers compensation premium
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
rates which for I think the last 16
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
years here in New Hampshire have gone
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
down that's obviously great news for our
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
small business
 
03:12:46.830 --> 03:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
Community I can't take any particular
 
03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
credit for that the credit goes to the
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
business Community here in New Hampshire
 
03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
that has taken a very serious commitment
 
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
to workplace safety they've embraced
 
03:12:59.870 --> 03:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
technologies that ensure that the
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
workplaces are safer that the tools the
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that their workers are
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
engaged with are safer and they're also
 
03:13:10.030 --> 03:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh to be credited for the fact that when
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
somebody is hurt on the job they are
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
moving that process along very
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
expeditiously to get that person the
 
03:13:18.269 --> 03:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
care that they need need and to get them
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
back on the job we also host on an
 
03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
annual basis a public hearing to discuss
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the cost drivers and Trends around the
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
cost of health insurance
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
premiums additionally we obviously as
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
the mission statement implies work to
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
protect consumers we have a consumer
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
division in our department those are
 
03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
seven individuals who all day every day
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that they come to the department are
 
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
taking in inquiries and calls from the
 
03:13:48.670 --> 03:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
public the department receives
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 7,000 calls per year of
 
03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
those 7,000 6,000 of them are
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
constituents with questions about some
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
aspect of their
 
03:14:02.830 --> 03:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
policy unfortunately the nature of
 
03:14:04.830 --> 03:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
insurance is such that when the consumer
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
needs to engage their insurance policy
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
almost certainly something bad has
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
happened to them they've wrecked the car
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
tree has fallen into the house family
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
member or loved one has passed away now
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
they're scrambling to find that life
 
03:14:20.910 --> 03:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
insurance policy understand what they're
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to do next there's all sorts of
 
03:14:26.510 --> 03:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
complicated terms within that policy and
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
now because of that something bad having
 
03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
happened they're in a heightened state
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
of stress they're trying to wait through
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
an incredibly complex document it's
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
completely understandable that they're
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
not going to be clear about particular
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
terms and Provisions so our consumer
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
division helps to work the consumer uh
 
03:14:46.630 --> 03:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
to get to a better understanding or at
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
least help help them understand the next
 
03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
steps that they're supposed to take
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
given whatever situation they're
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the other thousand calls turn into
 
03:14:58.030 --> 03:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
formal complaints against their
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier and again our consumer
 
03:15:02.190 --> 03:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
division will triage those on behalf of
 
03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer if they are of a more
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
complex or serious nature again they
 
03:15:08.469 --> 03:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
will get passed along to our enforcement
 
03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
unit or our Market conduct
 
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
units we also provide expertise and
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
support to you here in the legislature
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
as well as stakeholders and the public
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
we provide data and statistical analysis
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
of again health care costs and premiums
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
we in the last year have established
 
03:15:30.030 --> 03:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
within the department a new data
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
analytics unit that looks at important
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
Trends and data and
 
03:15:38.070 --> 03:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
statistics um both sides of the house
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're dedicated to doing that I've
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
affectionately nicknam them the math
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
nerds they're great uh but they are a
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous Resource as I've said toight
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
not only you but to the public and to
 
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders as well we administer and
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
analyze the Affordable Care Act as the
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
federal government has asked us to do
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
and as is as is appropriate and then
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
again we enforce the laws and rules that
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
promote uh financially sound principles
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
to provide consumer
 
03:16:10.030 --> 03:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
protection Amy here is in charge of
 
03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
collecting premium taxes fees and
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement penalties all of that go to
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund and then in addition to
 
03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
that uh we participate in the not only
 
03:16:24.469 --> 03:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
your legislative process but also we are
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
active members of the National
 
03:16:28.870 --> 03:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
important entity insurance is the last
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
Bastion of the American economy that is
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
predominantly regulated at the state
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
level and I think that we've done a good
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
job of that I think the states overall
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
have done a good job of that again the M
 
03:16:45.469 --> 03:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
the mission is consumer protection and
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
the states are obviously
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
in a much better position to be able to
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
act quickly to be able to better detect
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
trends that they are seeing in their
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
states and to make adjustments or to
 
03:16:59.790 --> 03:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
take protective actions for consumers
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
far faster far more efficient uh than
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government is built to do
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
but to ensure that companies are not
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
having to deal with a vastly different
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
Patchwork of regulatory environments
 
03:17:13.469 --> 03:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
from one state to another the National
 
03:17:15.150 --> 03:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
03:17:18.630 --> 03:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
was established uh to help there be some
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
uniformity in the rules and regulations
 
03:17:23.229 --> 03:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
that companies have to abide by there
 
03:17:25.750 --> 03:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
are always going to be nuances between
 
03:17:28.349 --> 03:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
the states we like that New Hampshire
 
03:17:30.030 --> 03:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
wants to be independent and do things
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
our own way that best work for our state
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
and our constituents but again the NAIC
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
helps to make sure that there is some
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
uniformity that allows for companies to
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
be able to do business with more ease so
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
that ultimately our consumers can have
 
03:17:49.750 --> 03:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
access to a wide array of products that
 
03:17:51.429 --> 03:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
they need for either themselves their
 
03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
families or their
 
03:17:54.239 --> 03:17:56.150 align:start position:0%
families or their
businesses

03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
so as we look
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
to the revenue projections that we have
 
03:18:04.830 --> 03:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
past I want to provide you with a little
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
bit of a background as to what the
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
department has experienced what we have
 
03:18:15.189 --> 03:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
seen in our insurance Market that gives
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
you some background as to
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing the numbers that you
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
are seeing so first I want to say that
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
obviously this committee appreciates
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
more than anyone that this is hardly an
 
03:18:30.030 --> 03:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
exact science you do the best you can
 
03:18:31.389 --> 03:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
with the information that you have
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
available with the trends that you've
 
03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
identified and you try to see and
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
project out where all of that is going
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
to go I will say too in a former life I
 
03:18:44.189 --> 03:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
was sitting where you were sitting
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
literally on this committee and I know
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
that the conversations are always a lot
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
easier if I come to you and
 
03:18:55.710 --> 03:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
say bad news of A Sort we said we were
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to collect X and in fact we
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
collect x amount over what we gave you
 
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
rather than me coming to you and saying
 
03:19:06.750 --> 03:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
oops we didn't collect quite as much as
 
03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:08.309 align:start position:0%
oops we didn't collect quite as much as
we

03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated good luck with all of that
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh I I would always rather be a little
 
03:19:15.070 --> 03:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
bit more on the conservative side uh
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
than to not meet the numbers
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
so again making this process for us a
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more difficult is we're
 
03:19:24.990 --> 03:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make projections for
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 7 billion dollar worth of
 
03:19:30.510 --> 03:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
written premium spread over 1,300
 
03:19:32.670 --> 03:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
companies across all lines of business
 
03:19:34.990 --> 03:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and so again that
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
is sometimes a difficult task when again
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're trying to analyze specific market
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
dynamics and Trends and
 
03:19:45.870 --> 03:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
challenges so the other thing that Amy
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
will get into and again why we try to be
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit cautious here is that the
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
carriers are required to pay their
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
estimated tax liability in advance as a
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of the prior Year's written
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
total premium and then reconcile any
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
difference at the end of the tax period
 
03:20:05.790 --> 03:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
so as you can appreciate the nature of
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
paying that liability on a
 
03:20:10.750 --> 03:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
pre-collection basis in introduces
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
additional uncertainty and this was
 
03:20:15.630 --> 03:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
especially so in the past when we were
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
dealing things like what was the impact
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic going to be precisely on
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry what was Medicaid
 
03:20:23.239 --> 03:20:24.469 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry what was Medicaid
Medicaid

03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
redetermination going to look like and
 
03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
what impact was that going to have when
 
03:20:31.630 --> 03:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
were we going to get back to the some
 
03:20:34.429 --> 03:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
sense of normaly and
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
because of the way this all works when
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the number that we give you is off it
 
03:20:42.990 --> 03:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
represents essentially a double hit one
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
from the previous year and again for the
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
current year so again that's why we try
 
03:20:52.189 --> 03:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be very uh cautious when we are
 
03:20:54.550 --> 03:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
providing you with all of these numbers
 
03:20:57.189 --> 03:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
and then in addition as you can see I
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
think the graphic you have there
 
03:21:03.070 --> 03:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
stretches back to fiscal year 2015 for a
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
number of years we saw a decline from
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
the previous year's aggregate estimate
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so we obviously didn't know exactly
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
how to take that into account and to
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
factor in how that may go and play out
 
03:21:18.189 --> 03:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
future so again we're going to get into
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
some of the broader issues that were
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
present both in the past and in the
 
03:21:28.349 --> 03:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
future one of those issues is the
 
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
industry is currently experiencing what
 
03:21:33.389 --> 03:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
we call a hard Market hard Market is a
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
technical insurance term that basically
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
says that the demand for current lines
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
of coverage are at tradition levels or
 
03:21:45.229 --> 03:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
higher but the access to that coverage
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
is more restricted and so at that point
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
you have a basic Supply demand Dynamic
 
03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
take hold in which what is left of that
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
coverage is obviously more expensive now
 
03:21:57.790 --> 03:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
again I'll get into this in a little bit
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
more detail later but on the one hand
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
you would think to yourself well if the
 
03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
cost of that coverage if the premium for
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
these coverages is higher then that
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
should yield more insurance premium tax
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
revenue and in a vacuum that is true but
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you have have to account for is how
 
03:22:20.349 --> 03:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
do those higher premiums factor into
 
03:22:20.359 --> 03:22:21.630 align:start position:0%
do those higher premiums factor into
consumer

03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
behavior and so for
 
03:22:28.189 --> 03:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
example if premiums are going up for the
 
03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
basic core coverages that people need
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
such as home and auto do people start
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
assessing you know maybe I don't need
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
that life insurance policy anymore I'm
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
now in my mid to late 60s my children
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
are grown they're in their professions
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're making good money I can let my
 
03:22:49.030 --> 03:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
my life insurance policy
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
laps for those families or individuals
 
03:22:54.030 --> 03:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
who have multiple Vehicles maybe they
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
say I've got the vehicle that I use for
 
03:22:58.790 --> 03:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of my travel but I've
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
got the nice play vehicle if you will
 
03:23:03.389 --> 03:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to go ahead and let that
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
sit in the garage for a year and not
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
cover that car so consumers will make
 
03:23:12.189 --> 03:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
adjustments to account for their
 
03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
particular Financial situations which
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
again counterbalances is the again in a
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
vacuum which should be additional IP
 
03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue because of those premiums going
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
up and so we have to factor all of that
 
03:23:27.150 --> 03:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
in uh which we certainly have tried to
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
do in the past again when you're looking
 
03:23:33.389 --> 03:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
at PNC we had to factor in what was the
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
disruption to supply chains going to be
 
03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic I can tell
 
03:23:41.349 --> 03:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
you that they are certainly better than
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
they were when they were really
 
03:23:44.189 --> 03:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
disrupted during the pandemic but
 
03:23:47.950 --> 03:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
they're not back to normal yet uh again
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the health side
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
of things we didn't know exactly what
 
03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid redetermination process was
 
03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to look like how fast that was
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
going to go whether those people were
 
03:23:57.279 --> 03:23:58.510 align:start position:0%
going to go whether those people were
going

03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:24:01.710 --> 03:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for individual Market
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
coverage with the enhanced subsidies or
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
whether they were going to ba bounce
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
back and forth with respect to
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility so again all of that
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
factored into why some of the numbers in
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
more recent years were a bit low now I
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
inherited the numbers up until the
 
03:24:21.189 --> 03:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
adjustment that we made uh not all that
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
long ago but let me say that I supported
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
the decision of the previous
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner to have estimates that were
 
03:24:28.030 --> 03:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
very low for the reasons that I've
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
previously explained but when we became
 
03:24:33.189 --> 03:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
very very confident that the numbers
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
needed to be adjusted it needed to be
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
adjusted upward we took that action in
 
03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
full transparency and because we as a
 
03:24:43.469 --> 03:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
department pride ourselves on ensuring
 
03:24:45.790 --> 03:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
that we are giving you accurate
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
information and the most accurate
 
03:24:50.030 --> 03:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
information that we have available at
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
any given time so again I'm going to get
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit more into some of those
 
03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
factors that are driving the current
 
03:24:58.990 --> 03:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
market that are playing into the numbers
 
03:25:01.469 --> 03:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
that are before you today for the next
 
03:25:03.750 --> 03:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
budget but for now I'll pass it back
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
over to Amy okay thank you commissioner
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me today if I may
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
interrupt for a minute I think we have a
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
question uh for the commissioner yes
 
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you commissioner
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
nice to see you here nice to see you uh
 
03:25:20.189 --> 03:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
my question relates to some of the
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
national trends that may affect the New
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire market for example the floods
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the Southeast the fires in California
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're not normally affected by those
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
kind of phenomenon but does it affect
 
03:25:32.910 --> 03:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
our market for insurance here in New
 
03:25:34.830 --> 03:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes the sh and answer to that
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
is yes and I'll dive into it now and
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
spare you I guess a little bit
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
later what is driving the current market
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
to be a hard Market is a very difficult
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
do of factors some of which will change
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
in a bait over time and some we are
 
03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to account for in the long
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
term so things that will change that
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
will Abate are things like inflation
 
03:26:07.269 --> 03:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
things like interest rates things like
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
Supply chains and from what we've
 
03:26:13.750 --> 03:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
observed so far while inflation on paper
 
03:26:16.349 --> 03:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
seems to be coming down there's a lag
 
03:26:17.950 --> 03:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
that takes place within the insurance
 
03:26:20.550 --> 03:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
industry that makes the experience for
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer as it pertains to inflation
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
delayed from when the rest of society
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
may see it say at the grocery store or
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
in other walks of their life interest
 
03:26:33.670 --> 03:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
rates or interest rates again I
 
03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned supply chain while certainly
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
better than it was during the pandemic
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
not back to pre-pandemic conditions if
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
any of you have a European car and need
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
a particular part you know often times
 
03:26:49.150 --> 03:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
you are waiting a very long time for
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
that part what does that mean that means
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you're having to access your rental
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle which your insurance carrier
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
covers and pays for for a longer period
 
03:27:02.189 --> 03:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
of time that increases cost puts upward
 
03:27:04.030 --> 03:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
pressure on
 
03:27:07.189 --> 03:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
premiums the other thing so those are
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the things that again are
 
03:27:12.429 --> 03:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
cyclical will aate over time we
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
understand that it's going to be
 
03:27:16.710 --> 03:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
different in the future things that we
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
are going to have to contend with for
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
the long term is the amount of
 
03:27:23.790 --> 03:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
technology that is going into vehicles
 
03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
and into homes now the vast majority of
 
03:27:26.359 --> 03:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
and into homes now the vast majority of
that

03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:30.189 --> 03:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
technology is such that we embrace it
 
03:27:32.349 --> 03:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
there're safety measures we want people
 
03:27:34.349 --> 03:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
to be as safe in their vehicles and in
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
their homes as humanly possible then yes
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
there are some luxury items for a long
 
03:27:41.790 --> 03:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
time I was driving around in a vehicle
 
03:27:43.750 --> 03:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
all summer with no air conditioning I'm
 
03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
cheap I didn't want to fix it I didn't
 
03:27:47.950 --> 03:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
need it I just down the windows my wife
 
03:27:49.229 --> 03:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the other hand has a vehicle that
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
gives her a back massage as she's going
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
up Route
 
03:27:55.070 --> 03:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
93 all of that is to say whether the
 
03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
technology is safety oriented or luxury
 
03:28:01.110 --> 03:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
oriented it's more expensive and so when
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
those things break the cost to repair
 
03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
them is higher and the expertise needed
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
to fix it to do the actual work is more
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
expensive so those are things that again
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
unless people want to go back to the
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
Model T of the Fred Flyn Stone mobile
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be something that we
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
have to contend with into the future
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
that is not going away representative om
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
the big thing that is here presumably to
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
stay for a long time that we have very
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
very little control over is the impact
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
of these catastrophic weather events and
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I'm not here in any way
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
shape or form to get into a discussion
 
03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
as to the causes of of climate change or
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
what should be done about it that is
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
your job congress's job the jobs of
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
presidents and prime ministers and
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
everything in between to deal with that
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's not my role as insurance
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner what my role is to tell you
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:29:05.790 --> 03:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
statistically the data is
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
undeniable that the severity and
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
frequency of these
 
03:29:13.469 --> 03:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
storms is more and more
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
prevalent some of which capture the head
 
03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
lines such as the Hurricanes that wipe
 
03:29:21.870 --> 03:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
out Florida or the Carolinas of the Gulf
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
Coast or the horrific wildfires such as
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen in Los Angeles and let me say
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
that that latest incident is going to be
 
03:29:34.269 --> 03:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
very uh impactful on the industry in
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
ways that we're not yet able to
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically predict but certainly those
 
03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
types of incidents are tragedies under
 
03:29:41.960 --> 03:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
types of incidents are tragedies under
any

03:29:42.790 --> 03:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
circumstance but it is certainly a
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
particular challenge for the insurance
 
03:29:48.189 --> 03:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
industry given that those wildfires took
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
place in one of the most expensive real
 
03:29:52.189 --> 03:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
estate markets in the
 
03:29:54.750 --> 03:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
world and so when companies are having
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
to pay out those
 
03:29:56.600 --> 03:29:58.110 align:start position:0%
to pay out those
massive

03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
massive
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
claims it has an impact on their overall
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
Financial Health as well as their
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
ability to access affordable
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
reinsurance and so how that plays out is
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
a spreading of that
 
03:30:14.110 --> 03:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
pain across the country and ultimately
 
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
leads to higher premiums for cons
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
consumers so those are the main pillars
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the current hard Market that we're
 
03:30:23.429 --> 03:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
experiencing again all of these things
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
are accounted for in the numbers that
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
we're giving you for the next budget but
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative is yes they do and what
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
exactly we do about that I don't
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
know could I ask a followup on that sure
 
03:30:39.479 --> 03:30:41.070 align:start position:0%
know could I ask a followup on that sure
um

03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:43.950 --> 03:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
if if your insurance company is a
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
smaller insurance company that serves
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
the local market New England maybe
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
around the New England
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
area is that could that company possibly
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
offer better insurance rates because
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're not affected by the California
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
fires certainly they could I mean
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's an opport there's a business
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to be sure but it's
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
not as easy as simply saying you know
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally in the past we've offered
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
personal Lines Auto and some Commercial
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
Auto but because of what's just happened
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to break into to
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the homeowners insurance market and all
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
of that it's not that easy because
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
they've got to go through the process
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
with our department of expanding into
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
those markets and again demonstrating to
 
03:31:28.630 --> 03:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
the department that they have the
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
financial health and the financial
 
03:31:34.990 --> 03:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
reserves needed for them to be able to
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
markets representative
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
ulery good to see you again good to see
 
03:31:45.279 --> 03:31:46.910 align:start position:0%
ulery good to see you again good to see
you

03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
I hope the kids are doing well they're
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
driving me crazy but they're doing
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
well could you uh just follow me on the
 
03:31:58.269 --> 03:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
same uh train of thought uh the
 
03:32:00.990 --> 03:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
reinsurance market is actually where our
 
03:32:03.309 --> 03:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
local insurance companies get hit the
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
hardest that's right and as to the
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
comments that were made earlier if a
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
local insurance compan is truly local
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
then they can isolate themselves from
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
National events or even International
 
03:32:18.070 --> 03:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
events uh depending upon the size of the
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
company and all that uh but you have the
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
bar Clays of the world which reinsure
 
03:32:27.189 --> 03:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
the Lloyds which reinsure they get hit
 
03:32:30.030 --> 03:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
on something on 12,000 miles away
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
literally Halfway Around the
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
World um can affect our Market what 100%
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
can just for those that are unaware
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank it's a really important point that
 
03:32:45.070 --> 03:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
you raise so let me give you the most
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
simplistic EXP explanation of
 
03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
reinsurance that I possibly can
 
03:32:50.590 --> 03:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
reinsurance is insurance for insurance
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
companies so insurance companies will
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
say in any given year we're going to
 
03:32:58.229 --> 03:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
cover all losses e up to X number of
 
03:33:00.910 --> 03:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
million or billion and then any losses
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
that come in over that amount the
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
reinsurer is going to pay those claims
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
cover those claims reinsurance companies
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
are large global companies
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative ulri just mentioned some
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
of the most prominent ones I would add
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
Swiss re into that a conversation as
 
03:33:23.189 --> 03:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
well they're not isolated to Any Given
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
state or any given country uh they have
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with everything that is playing
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
out across the globe in many many cases
 
03:33:35.309 --> 03:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
and so when you're talking about a small
 
03:33:38.189 --> 03:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
local or Regional company it's going to
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
have an impact in terms of cost on their
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
ability to pay the premiums for their
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
reinsurer or in some case to be able to
 
03:33:49.630 --> 03:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
keep their reinsurer at all when I go to
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
national conferences I will occasionally
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
be pulled aside by a company who will
 
03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
say commissioner I just want to give you
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
heads up unfortunately we're going to
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
have to stop writing in New Hampshire we
 
03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
just want you to know that we love New
 
03:34:03.070 --> 03:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's nothing that you've done
 
03:34:04.750 --> 03:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's nothing your legislature has done
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
or Governor it's just we've lost our
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
reinsurer and so we're working
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
aggressively to find a new reinsurer and
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
as soon as we do that we'll be back and
 
03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
we can't wait
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
all of that plays into it as well so
 
03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's a really good point representative
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:34:29.229 --> 03:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
um we're the second oldest state in the
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
United States behind Maine and my
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
concern is what if anything can be done
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
to protect the consumer from large
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
premium increases on long-term
 
03:34:40.790 --> 03:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
care boy oh boy how much time do we have
 
03:34:42.750 --> 03:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
for this Mr chairman uh we are getting
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
tight on time uh long-term care
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
insurance is a huge problem and again
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be attentive to time when
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
long-term care insurance was in its
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
Heyday when it was going gang busters in
 
03:34:59.070 --> 03:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
terms of sales this was back in the 80s
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
and 90s and the actuaries for the
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
companies big ones like Genworth for
 
03:35:05.279 --> 03:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
companies big ones like Genworth for
example

03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
were looking at these products and
 
03:35:11.710 --> 03:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
making assumptions on them they made the
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
assumption that people would treat
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
long-term care insurance the same way
 
03:35:17.830 --> 03:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
they treat life insurance which is to
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
say typically in life insurance you'll
 
03:35:22.510 --> 03:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
get to a certain age and you'll say okay
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
as I kind of described before I'm at a
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
point now in my life where my family is
 
03:35:30.910 --> 03:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
going to be okay financially when I go
 
03:35:32.670 --> 03:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
and so at some point they're going to
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
let their premium lap their policy laps
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
they made that assumption about
 
03:35:41.189 --> 03:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
long-term care and in fact the exact
 
03:35:45.429 --> 03:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
opposite took place the older people got
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
the the more tightly they hung on to
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
their policies because the mentality was
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'm getting older I'm feeling older my
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
day may be coming when I need to access
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
assisted living or a nursing home or
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the case might be and so they
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
vastly underpriced the product they did
 
03:36:07.389 --> 03:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
not put Provisions in those policies to
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
account for inflation and so a lot of
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
those companies are now in serious
 
03:36:12.199 --> 03:36:13.189 align:start position:0%
those companies are now in serious
financial

03:36:13.189 --> 03:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
trouble the niic and here in the state
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
have brought forward a number of
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives over a number of years to
 
03:36:22.950 --> 03:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
try to protect consumers from that
 
03:36:25.030 --> 03:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Supreme Court here in
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire struck down a number of
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
the protections that we attempted to put
 
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
in place but what is available to
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
Consumers now is the ability for them to
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
work with the company to rightsize their
 
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
benefit they may not need the richness
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
of the benefit that they currently have
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
and so they can again adjust it such
 
03:36:47.070 --> 03:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
that they'll see a corresponding
 
03:36:50.590 --> 03:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in premium there's a lot more
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
to that I would be happy to talk with
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
you about all of those details offline
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
it is obviously a great concern to me in
 
03:36:59.189 --> 03:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
the department and we're actively
 
03:36:59.199 --> 03:37:00.309 align:start position:0%
the department and we're actively
working

03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
it thank you I think for now we'll
 
03:37:05.790 --> 03:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
continue on all right great
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'll try to figure out how to
 
03:37:09.630 --> 03:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
shorten mine up a little
 
03:37:13.150 --> 03:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
bit I will pick up on page slide seven
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
where DJ left off after talking about
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
the the insurance market I'll go over
 
03:37:19.710 --> 03:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
some other variables that will impact
 
03:37:23.309 --> 03:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
our Revenue uh the first variable being
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
the taxable premiums written so that is
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
the largest variable because it's our
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
tax B base that we calculate the premium
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
taxes on uh so if the premiums written
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
increase we would anticipate our Revenue
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
to increase uh the retaliatory premium
 
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
tax rates that is meant to equalize the
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
tax burden across States so we are
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
authorized to collect the higher tax
 
03:37:53.229 --> 03:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
rate of New Hampshire's tax rate or the
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
tax rate of the company's state of
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
domicile similar is the retell fees and
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
assessments so if say Delaware collects
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
a fraud fee and our New Hampshire
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
domestics have to pay that we then can
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
retaliate and collect a fraud fee from
 
03:38:13.710 --> 03:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
the Delaware domicile
 
03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
companies uh we'll have companies that
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
amend their tax returns throughout the
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
year and a lot of times in our audit
 
03:38:23.469 --> 03:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
findings we will go ahead and request
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
that they audit it if they left
 
03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:26.070 align:start position:0%
that they audit it if they left
something

03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:38:29.950 --> 03:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
off which could generate more Revenue uh
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
companies sometimes redem estic to other
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
states which then in turn would affect
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
the retaliatory tax rate or the
 
03:38:40.269 --> 03:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
retaliatory fees that we
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
collect we have producer adjusters and
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
entities the licensing volume will
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
fluctuate we have enforcement penalties
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh that are difficult to predict based
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
on the nature of the work that they do
 
03:38:56.910 --> 03:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
and we have allow some premium tax
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
credits that we will get into in great
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
detail on subsequent
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
slides so now if we take a look at the
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
sources of our Revenue at the department
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh we collect premium taxes from the
 
03:39:13.389 --> 03:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
admitted and non-admitted Sh insurers
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
this is our largest source of Revenue
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
last year it was about
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
83.5% or
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
136.6 million of our
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh we collect premium taxes from
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
our licensed insurers we have
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
57 uh domestics here in the State uh the
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
rest being from out of state will refer
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
to as foreign insurers and these
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
licensed insurers write uh lines of
 
03:39:42.510 --> 03:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
business such as Property and Casualty
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
which would be your home Auto Workers
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
Comp lines uh we have life insurers
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
accident and health insurers which write
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
on both a group and an individual basis
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we also have health or medical
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
insurance uh we collect from registered
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
entities such as risk retention groups
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
and purchasing groups we collect taxes
 
03:40:08.189 --> 03:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
from licensed producers that have
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines Authority on their license
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we collect premium taxes from inde
 
03:40:17.309 --> 03:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
independent procured business and those
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
are policy holders who directly purchase
 
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
from a non-admitted
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
insurer the other 165% of our Revenue
 
03:40:28.510 --> 03:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
comes from the fees and penalties that
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
we collect these are from the licensed
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
and registered entities and Insurance
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
Producers and adjusters that equated to
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
26.8 Million last year so totaling
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
163.5 million for 2020
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
4 so now we're going to look a little
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
bit closer at these Revenue
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
sources uh like I mentioned the licensed
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies is where we generate
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
the most
 
03:41:00.429 --> 03:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh we have a premium tax rate of
 
03:41:02.910 --> 03:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
1.25% for the Property and Casualty
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
lines of business and 2% for the
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
accident and health lines of business we
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
do collect a $200 minimum tax from each
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
licensed company and risk retention
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
group and we do have that retaliatory
 
03:41:19.710 --> 03:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
provision in place like I mentioned to
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
equalize the tax burden across the
 
03:41:27.070 --> 03:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
states so as of December 31st
 
03:41:31.389 --> 03:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
2024 we will be looking to collect 1300
 
03:41:34.030 --> 03:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
125 tax returns from the licensed
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
companies and risk retention groups and
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be due on or before March
 
03:41:43.630 --> 03:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
15 so how this works is come March we'll
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
be collecting the 2024 for tax liability
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to be sub
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
subtracting out the estimated prepayment
 
03:41:53.550 --> 03:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
that was made on their prior year's tax
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
return that in essence will create a
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
true up for
 
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
2024 then they're going to pay 100% of
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
that tax liability as an estimated
 
03:42:07.229 --> 03:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
payment for their 2025 tax
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
liability so if the premiums increase
 
03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
from the prior year they're going to Mo
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
owe more in their true up and More in
 
03:42:16.349 --> 03:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
their pre payment for the following year
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a double impact to our Revenue
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
projections we're going to collect taxes
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
from the Surplus lines producers and
 
03:42:30.149 --> 03:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
last year that was only about 5% of our
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue premium tax revenue uh that'll
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
be 3% on the premiums written for
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
policies covering risks here in the
 
03:42:41.229 --> 03:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
state and as of year end
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
2024 we've had uh 340 340 producers so
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
far uh submit their annual premium tax
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
report and premium tax that is due so
 
03:42:55.469 --> 03:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
the deadline is this Friday and we
 
03:42:58.750 --> 03:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
expect quite a few more uh we have
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
independently procured business taxed at
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
4% however this is less than 1% of our
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
revenue and those reports and taxes are
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
due on March
 
03:43:14.349 --> 03:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
1st so next we're going to take a look
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
at a historical View for the past 10
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
years of the revenue that we've
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
collected by
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
source and you'll see the admitted
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
Market which is our licensed and risk
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
retention groups is the bulk of it it's
 
03:43:28.720 --> 03:43:30.389 align:start position:0%
retention groups is the bulk of it it's
128.3

03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
128.3
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
million the Surplus line producers was 7
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
million and the indep independently
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
procured is just over a
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
million then we have our fees and our
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
fines which were 26 .8 million totaling
 
03:43:51.510 --> 03:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
the 163.5
 
03:43:53.710 --> 03:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
million next I want to take a little
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
closer look at the how the premium tax
 
03:43:59.870 --> 03:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
credits import our impact our Revenue
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me so the first we'll talk about
 
03:44:06.349 --> 03:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
is the business Enterprise tax that is
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
collected from the Department of Revenue
 
03:44:12.309 --> 03:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh or the BET as we refer to it uh the
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
bet is that is imposed under RSA 77e is
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
allowed as a credit against the premium
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
taxes due under RSA
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
400a and any credit amount in excess of
 
03:44:28.189 --> 03:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
the premium tax liability can be applied
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to the company's business profits tax
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
therefore there's no carry forwards for
 
03:44:34.439 --> 03:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
therefore there's no carry forwards for
unused

03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
unused
 
03:44:39.269 --> 03:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
credits uh last year we had 143
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
companies that took that credit and with
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
over 1,300 premium tax returns that's
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
about 11 % of the companies taking a bet
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
credit that the past two years that has
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
amounted to roughly close to 3.7 million
 
03:44:55.479 --> 03:44:56.910 align:start position:0%
amounted to roughly close to 3.7 million
each

03:44:56.910 --> 03:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
year next we have uh credits taken under
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
162 L10 for contributions made to the
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
Community Development Finance Authority
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
who supports Community projects across
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
the state an investment tax credit equal
 
03:45:15.870 --> 03:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
to 75% of the contribut tion made to the
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
authority during the tax year is allowed
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
credit uh contributions received by The
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
Authority which qualify for the credit
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
can be taken but shall not exceed 5
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
million in any state fiscal
 
03:45:33.309 --> 03:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
year and these credits can be carried
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
forward up to five years and cannot
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
exceed 1 million in any given tax year
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh last two years we only had one
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
company claim this credit last year it
 
03:45:45.790 --> 03:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
was 37
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
,500 the year before that 56,000 so it
 
03:45:53.790 --> 03:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
has not had a big impact on our
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue the last credit that I would uh
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
that is allowed against premium tax is
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
in accordance with chapter 408 B13 which
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
are credits for assessments paid to the
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire life and health insurance

03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
Association I'd like to look at this in
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
more detail today uh as this will have a
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
substantial imp impact to our fiscal
 
03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:16.710 align:start position:0%
substantial imp impact to our fiscal
year

03:46:16.710 --> 03:46:16.720 align:start position:0%

2025 Revenue along with the coming years
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
so the guarantee Association is composed
 
03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:26.800 align:start position:0%

in the event that a member insur is
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%

calendar years following the year in
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
which the assessment was
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
paid the association did Issue a Class B
 
03:47:10.030 --> 03:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
assessment during calendar year
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
2024 however prior to calendar year
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
2024 uh um Class B assessments had only
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
been issued one other time in the
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
history of this program in 2013 they
 
03:47:28.830 --> 03:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
issued an assessment totaling 2,2
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
2,225 th000 and the impact of the credit
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
was approximately 400,000 for each of
 
03:47:34.960 --> 03:47:36.070 align:start position:0%
was approximately 400,000 for each of
five

03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
years um during calendar year 2024
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
Colorado Bankers Life Insurance went
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
insolvent and Class B assessments were
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
issued that total $35 million so the
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
potential impact to the revenue each
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
year for 5 years is 20% or $7
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
million the impact in the first year of
 
03:48:02.110 --> 03:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
the credit is doubled because the
 
03:48:05.070 --> 03:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
carriers are projected to pay the
 
03:48:08.550 --> 03:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
projected taxes prepaid and collected in
 
03:48:11.229 --> 03:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
advance result resulting in the
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
potential of 14 million due to the
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
permitted credit along with the
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
prepayment of the tax
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
liability the good news is since the
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
insurer's tax liability cannot be
 
03:48:26.469 --> 03:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
reduced below zero we do not anticipate
 
03:48:28.349 --> 03:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
that all carriers will be able to use
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
credit the next slide on the pie chart
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
is a Breakout by company type of the net
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
taxable premiums written in New
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where last year there was over
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
7.6 billion ion of premiums written in
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
the state the split is somewhat close
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
between the Property and Casualty lines
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
of business where Property and Casualty
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:17.950 --> 03:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
so you'll see here the life was 1.5
 
03:49:22.510 --> 03:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
billion Health 2.9 billion Property and
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
Casualty over three billion and then
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:34.110 --> 03:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
each next we're going to touch on how we
 
03:49:37.469 --> 03:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
derive our Pro projections uh we have a
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
team made up of individuals across
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
different business units we'll start
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
with the tax unit pulling together
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh premium information from the
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
company's annual statements we'll look
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
at that on an accounting and historical
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
perspective and then we sit down with
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
the actuaries as well as the leadership
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
team the actuaries actually will get the
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh rate filings so they have an idea of
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
what the companies are submitting based
 
03:50:11.710 --> 03:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
on their experience and what ultimate
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately will drive the premiums
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
we take uh what the actuaries have to
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
say very seriously uh where there's such
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
a lag with the premium data it's more of
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
a historical basis what we can
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
gather uh if we take a look at our
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal 2024 revenue on the next slide
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
along with the 2025 Revenue projections
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
the First Column is our
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
results as of June 30th
 
03:50:46.189 --> 03:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
2024 where you'll see the breakout there
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.399 --> 03:50:53.389 align:start position:0%
 
146.880

03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
146.880
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
we transferred 10.3 million to uh
 
03:51:01.149 --> 03:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS and we also made a transfer for the
 
03:51:03.389 --> 03:51:03.399 align:start position:0%
first time to New Hampshire employment
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
security for the Paid Family Medical
 
03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:07.950 align:start position:0%
security for the Paid Family Medical
Leave

03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
Leave
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
program the next column is our
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
authorized budget of 143 million which
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
we would have derived back in 2022 based
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
on 2021
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
premiums then in January of
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
2024 like the commissioner said we
 
03:51:26.830 --> 03:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
revised our uh projection to be 150
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
million so the last column there is our
 
03:51:32.910 --> 03:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated revenue for this fiscal
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
year uh the Top Line being line being
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the premium tax liability that will be
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
due taking away the estimated
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
prepayments followed by prepay pays for
 
03:51:48.670 --> 03:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
the following year calendar year
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
2025 uh we expect 7 million from the
 
03:51:51.479 --> 03:51:53.510 align:start position:0%
2025 uh we expect 7 million from the
unlicensed

03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
03:51:55.830 --> 03:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
companies and then the fees we're
 
03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
looking to collect 24 million then
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see the transfer to
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS which the same as uh this past year
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
and our
 
03:52:11.349 --> 03:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
transfer anticipated transfer to New
 
03:52:15.309 --> 03:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
uh looking ahead to fiscal year 26 and
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
27 we have projected 26 to be at 158
 
03:52:27.389 --> 03:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
million and 27 to be at 162
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
million so just something to note we do
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
collect uh premium taxes from the three
 
03:52:36.830 --> 03:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
mcos and along with Delta Dental um who
 
03:52:38.910 --> 03:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
all contract with the HHS for the
 
03:52:40.670 --> 03:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
Program um those taxes that we collect
 
03:52:45.870 --> 03:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
attribute to that program do get
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
transferred to
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh so that does not have uh impact
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
one way or the other on our
 
03:52:54.359 --> 03:52:56.830 align:start position:0%
one way or the other on our
projections

03:52:56.830 --> 03:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
projections
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
so the only thing I would mention about
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
that obviously is the transfer to
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS always varies a bit as you may
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
recall when the state decided to expand
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program we dedicated the
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the IP generated from that
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
coverage to contribute to the state's
 
03:53:22.189 --> 03:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
non-federal share for that program the
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
other thing I would mention you could
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
put a bit of an asteris next to it is
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
the grand estate home mitigation and
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
resiliency program for million dollars
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is a bit of a a hope of mine but
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
I've got to make the sale for that
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
program from a policy perspective to
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
house Commerce and house finance and
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
Beyond um what this program seeks to do
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
as representative ol mentioned is to
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide consumers with a little bit of
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
relief given some of the weather related
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
dynamics that are impact in the
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
insurance Market the idea is to set
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
aside a million dollars in a grant fund
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
and consumers can apply into that Grant
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
fund to contribute towards some changes
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
in improvements to their home or their
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
property the eligibility for those
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
projects is all geared toward better
 
03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
position positioning the consumer in the
 
03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
underwriting process such that if
 
03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
they're able to make some repairs to
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
their roof or remove a dead tree that is
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
hanging over the home again that will
 
03:54:27.550 --> 03:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
factor in more positively for them in
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
underwriting resulting in lower premiums
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
at best at worst it will ensure that the
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
consumer is able to be renewed on their
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
current coverage and not kicked into the
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines Market which is
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
significantly more expensive for them
 
03:54:44.590 --> 03:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's the program in a nutshell stage
 
03:54:47.070 --> 03:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
are taking up these programs I think
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are six or seven of them currently
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
in effect across the country they are
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing consumers a great deal of good so
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking to New Hampshire eyesee
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
that concept and bring it here and again
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
leverage that to help our consumers
 
03:55:04.349 --> 03:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
better afford their home insurance uh
 
03:55:06.750 --> 03:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
premiums but again that'll be a policy
 
03:55:10.110 --> 03:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
discussion for Commerce in a dollars
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
discussion for house finance but that
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
million may or may not uh be there
 
03:55:17.309 --> 03:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
depending on how that process goes thank
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you uh we have a
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
question from representative
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
M yeah thank you the actuary tables are
 
03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
very important in determining the uh
 
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
rates and when I look at morality tables
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
on different U organizations such as the
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
pension system uh the IRS I see quite a
 
03:55:41.630 --> 03:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
variability in the mortality tables
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
could you supply the committee with your
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
mortality tables which I think would be
 
03:55:47.469 --> 03:55:47.479 align:start position:0%
much more objective as a neutral third
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
party we can see what our actuaries have
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
in that respect and we will certainly
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.429 --> 03:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:05.710 --> 03:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't yes so there was a question from
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
the back as to whether or not if the
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
granted State home resiliency mitigation
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
program does not go forward whether or
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
not the projections would be rounded up
 
03:56:17.950 --> 03:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
a million dollars yes we're anticipating
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
that we're going to collect at least
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
that million again I've segregated it
 
03:56:24.630 --> 03:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
out with the optimism that the program
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
will go forward but if it does not go
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
forward then yes it'll be accounted for
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
in the bottom line projections you see
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
there and the time frame for that for
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
knowing we'll certainly know by the time
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
it passes the um oh so our Revenue
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
estimates then we're certainly not going
 
03:56:44.670 --> 03:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
to know in the next
 
03:56:50.590 --> 03:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
yeah change being proposed I think in
 
03:56:56.590 --> 03:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to the house right now so
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
this not current law If This Were to
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
pass the house we would make the Surplus
 
03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
statement decreas the premium tax by a
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
million doll what he said perfect I
 
03:57:11.229 --> 03:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
agree all right thank you thank you guys
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
next next we'll hear from the Lottery
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
Commission and uh
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
you this doesn't contain any numbers in
 
03:58:12.880 --> 03:58:22.349 align:start position:0%
you this doesn't contain any numbers in
it

03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but I want the winning
 
03:58:28.990 --> 03:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
number oh those numbers s the governor
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
gets those that's really it's a joke
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
it's completely
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
joke okay I think everyone has the hand
 
03:58:38.429 --> 03:58:38.439 align:start position:0%
out now so we will let you get started
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh good afternoon Mr chair members
 
03:58:42.429 --> 03:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Charlie McIntyre
 
03:58:44.349 --> 03:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
Lotter director and with me is our Chief
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Jim durus um just a
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
brief handout to go over what
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
essentially we sell and where our money
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
comes from um the first page obviously
 
03:58:58.590 --> 03:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
are two things um one is a pie chart
 
03:59:01.229 --> 03:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
which indicates essentially still half
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
of our revenues come from scratch
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
tickets I would caution as you work down
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
the second page which is where all the
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
games are
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
outlined everything from Instant tickets
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
to fast play is gross
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
sales I Lottery is essentially net of
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
prices and sports betting is essentially
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
our revenue from
 
03:59:28.439 --> 03:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
our revenue from
DraftKings

03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
DraftKings
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
and investigation and compliance is
 
03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
essentially charitable gambling Revenue
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
that the state gets and Lucky for Life
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
is gross sales so all revenues are not
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
equal in that respect um and Lucky for
 
03:59:49.229 --> 03:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
Life and all of the eight top games are
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
sold in
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
stores and on the internet we do sell
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
Powerball Mega
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
Millions insta tickets give me five and
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to launch pick three
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
pick four soon yeah next next month and
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
so um that's a breakdown of our revenues
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
I would I didn't want to go over it
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
today because it's a bit significant but
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
um soon this will be uh adopted by the
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal Comm committee this is our annual
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive final financial report
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be available on our website as
 
04:00:22.510 --> 04:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
well it contains everything you'd ever
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
want to know about Lottery but we're
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
afraid to ask um if you a predecessor of
 
04:00:29.469 --> 04:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
mine once handed this out at the state
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
house and got in trouble for using that
 
04:00:33.870 --> 04:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
much ink so it's now digitally on our
 
04:00:37.229 --> 04:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
website and available um this is audited
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
by your LBA um and that's presented I
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
think it's 30th 30th yeah so
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
um if you want to learn more and
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
certainly I I fa the questions from this
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee before happy to answer any
 
04:00:52.469 --> 04:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
questions I would
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
have uh the next page is essentially a
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the gross revenues to the
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
lottery over the last 10 years uh you
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
growth uh from 2020 to 2021 was really
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
the largest growth um
 
04:01:17.309 --> 04:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
sports betting passed in 20 but if you
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
remember correctly it passed and then Co
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
happened and there were virtually no
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
Sports uh we were taking action on
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
burundian soccer and Russian table
 
04:01:28.990 --> 04:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
tennis and I am not making that up W um
 
04:01:30.630 --> 04:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
but then when Sports returned obviously
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
sports betting um came came back and
 
04:01:36.510 --> 04:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
it's been uh exceptionally profitable
 
04:01:38.670 --> 04:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
for the state right now New Hampshire is
 
04:01:40.469 --> 04:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
the second most profitable state in the
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
in the country for sports betting
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue behind only New York uh and they
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
that and uh the next slide which is Page
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
four is essentially what our um
 
04:01:57.070 --> 04:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
projections for gross revenues
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
are currently year-over-year we're
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 5% down over last year um
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
reasons it suggest a certain softness at
 
04:02:16.110 --> 04:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
retail um and also most importantly FY
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
24 was the best year we've ever had for
 
04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
Powerball and Megamillion sales and that
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
was due to interest rates I know it's
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
help it hurts some people it helps us
 
04:02:30.750 --> 04:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
because the jackpot is a product of cash
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
on hand multiplied by a bond factor and
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
that Bond Factor more than almost
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
doubled over the last three years as
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
interest rates Rose and so a billion
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollar jackpot was no longer
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
unachievable it was almost common and so
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
in 2024 I think we
 
04:02:49.469 --> 04:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
had four four or five four or five and
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
actually I think we had one that was2
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
billion and so yeah and so that had a
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
dramatic impact on our um revenues if
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the number before Powerball
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
on the page you'll see $57 million and
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
Mega Millions was 34 over 80 million
 
04:03:10.750 --> 04:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
that would be a high year by almost 20
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
some odat million and Powerball Mega
 
04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
Millions for for us is a 40% profit game
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
so every million dollars we that's off
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
um my favorite slide is page five which
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
is distributions
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
education um FY 24 we came in at $27
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
million of profitability uh 47 million
 
04:03:39.800 --> 04:03:41.309 align:start position:0%
million of profitability uh 47 million
over

04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
plan sorry I want that to sink in little
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
bit um and it was our record year far in
 
04:03:50.110 --> 04:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
away uh as you can
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
imagine and the last slide which is not
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
as positive is essentially we're holding
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
at $180 million estimate for this fiscal
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
year and then the out two years of the
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
next two years of the budget would be
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
172.5 for each year um like I said we're
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
seeing a softness at retail um we don't
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
expect powerwell to have the same
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
numbers it had before as well as Mega
 
04:04:17.149 --> 04:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
Millions which are very similar games um
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
and we're cautiously optimistic we've
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
seen a decline in sports betting now the
 
04:04:23.950 --> 04:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
mass launched it wasn't the negative
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
impact we had anticipated uh we went
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
from a high of $38 million in sports
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
million so it's declined but not that
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
much and so um wanted to keep it very
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
simple and allow for any questions you
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.750 --> 04:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
representer thank you director
 
04:04:51.389 --> 04:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
yeah you're making a lot of money how
 
04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
much do you spending to operate to make
 
04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
that money so our budget cost is 15
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
million with the state budget our
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
expenses are larger than that because
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
prizes is an expense and that's our
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
largest expense it's prizes far and away
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
yeah that doesn't matter that doesn't
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
count yeah and so our budget expense is
 
04:05:10.349 --> 04:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
about 15
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
million you make enough money to that's
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
make enough money to make money correct
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct 5 Z 15 15 15 that's a lot
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
what you folks talk about what it's in
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
the budget right or yeah you just said
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
your cost was we we weren't sure what
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
you were saying 50 or 15 no it's 15
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I mean there are expenses like for
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
example DraftKings are relationship with
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
DraftKings it's um The Profit the gross
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
profit is 80 million and our share of
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
that is around 34 million so I don't
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
count that as an expense because it
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't there's no expense it's
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
literally just they send us a monthly
 
04:06:02.670 --> 04:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
transfer monthly yeah yeah monthly uh
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
and so that I don't count that as an
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
expense either because it's right
 
04:06:06.990 --> 04:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
makesense same with charitable gambling
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know our expenses are the employees
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
we have on the payroll and the cost for
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
them and their cars and materials but
 
04:06:15.070 --> 04:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
what the Char what The Operators pay we
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't really count as an
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
expense other questions representative
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
home yeah thank you director
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
McIntyre looking at the uh current law
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
and the revenue for going out to 2027
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
does that include the uh estimated
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from historic horse racing yes
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
so if you go to the F first slide which
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
is where the pie chart is um $33.3
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
million is what the Charo gambling side
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
of our house which is the investigations
 
04:06:44.319 --> 04:06:45.550 align:start position:0%
of our house which is the investigations
compliance

04:06:45.550 --> 04:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
04:06:48.189 --> 04:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
division the vast majority of that is
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry it's this one here look this
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
there's a number here it says
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
investigations and compliance division
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's chargeable gambling revenue and
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of that is historic
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
horse racing it's averaging currently
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
month representative Ames I for a minute
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
I thought gee maybe he was really on our
 
04:07:12.880 --> 04:07:17.229 align:start position:0%
I thought gee maybe he was really on our
committee

04:07:17.229 --> 04:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
am entitled to ask questions why not you
 
04:07:23.710 --> 04:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
are as a substitute um yeah I'll be gone
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
before you know
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
it no it's a good thing to see you here
 
04:07:32.149 --> 04:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
well um could you speak a little more
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
about uh the trajectory and charal
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
gaming and what's happening overall and
 
04:07:42.109 --> 04:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
how that affects revenues now and
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
looking forward
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
certainly I can speak to their
 
04:07:49.710 --> 04:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
trajectory um in short order the number
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
of machines is going to grow
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically in state and next
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
week I do the I visit the final
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
inspection of the Nash which I
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
understand to have over a thousand
 
04:08:05.070 --> 04:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
machines um that launches I believe in
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
end of January I'm not going the opening
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
before the opening um the facility in
 
04:08:13.149 --> 04:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
Conway was scheduled to open next week
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's open the following week um so the
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
number of machines is growing
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
significantly I would imagine from what
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
is now 2,300 machines I think in state
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
will grow to over 5,000 next calendar
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
year uh and so with it our would be our
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
revenues if obviously this is a revenue
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh would be our revenues would
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
grow as well dramatically I would
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
anticipate it being more than double if
 
04:08:42.149 --> 04:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
they come online they just haven't come
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
online yet so I don't like to ask
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
estimate based off of them and I imagine
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
this will be a evolving process
 
04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
regarding Revenue so I'll be back here
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
sure you follow up uh your microphone
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
please thank
 
04:09:01.710 --> 04:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
you so uh do you uh have a number per
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
machine that you use and sort of
 
04:09:07.229 --> 04:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
guesstimating that uh the revenue that
 
04:09:09.309 --> 04:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
will be produced by historic horse
 
04:09:11.710 --> 04:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
racing yes so
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
currently Statewide the average what we
 
04:09:17.109 --> 04:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
call a win per unit per day which is the
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
amount that's in the machine at the end
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the day last we checked I checked it
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
was $239 per machine per day um and it's
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
still growing meaning the the the trend
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.109 --> 04:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
up but that's with historic horse racing
 
04:09:35.119 --> 04:09:38.590 align:start position:0%
up but that's with historic horse racing
machines

04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
yeah sounds that sounds very much like
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
the slot machine number that I used to
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
hear you speak of years ago yeah and if
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
I was to revise estimates on slot
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
machines I would raise them raise them
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
significantly um
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
the revenue from a VT or a slot machine
 
04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
if we want to call it that would
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
probably be 30 to 40% higher than an HHR
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
machine because while they look similar
 
04:10:05.469 --> 04:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
they play differently and the player
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
knows so uh I would anticipated a
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
significant if I was to read Revenue
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
estimates which I actually am doing
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a couple of VT bills um
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
it would be higher much much
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
higher thank
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
you represent ery okay for the other
 
04:10:26.189 --> 04:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
part um your
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
agency has access to information
 
04:10:31.389 --> 04:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
regarding problem gaming or
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
gambling um has that account or fund
 
04:10:39.109 --> 04:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
been significantly uh uh tapped more or
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
less or less less the the council which
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
is tendered the money hasn't really been
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
active this this fiscal
 
04:10:52.189 --> 04:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
year did I hear you say less yes thank
 
04:10:52.199 --> 04:10:53.790 align:start position:0%
year did I hear you say less yes thank
you

04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
sir representative Southwest thank you
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question of course so
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the final page six chart um
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
the increases you're talking about
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're expecting will be offset by
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
softening in other areas correct correct
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
and power like I said Powerball for
 
04:11:12.510 --> 04:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
example if we're off $30 million in
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
Powerball Mega sales that's a you know
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
1213 million negative direct so you're
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
balancing those correct correct and as
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
like any business we have now multiple
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
verticals and so now they're they're
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
sort of balancing each other out and
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to stay ideally
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
flat representative D set thank you Mr
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you director
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
McIntyre uh you said sports betting with
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
the Advent of Massachusetts going online
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
our revenues were at 38 million
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
and they' we've subsequently gone down
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
to 32 if I correct me if I'm
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
wrong uh yeah that's correct we had 38
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
and 23 and I think last year was 33 last
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
let was 33
 
04:12:00.030 --> 04:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
2024 do how how much of that do you
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
think is relative to the fact that those
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
betters were coming from Massachusetts
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
compared to you know I have a bill in to
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
open it up to different vendors yeah uh
 
04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
the competition because I've I've heard
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
that from consu they can play three
 
04:12:18.109 --> 04:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
different vendors down there and what
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
that reality may or may not be in
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
reality there are only two nationally
 
04:12:27.550 --> 04:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
FanDuel and DraftKings essentially have
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
85% of the
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace and one of the difficulties
 
04:12:35.109 --> 04:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
is is that opening up a second
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
operator I'm not sure increases the pie
 
04:12:42.030 --> 04:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
only because it'll increase like you'll
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
have more both will have
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
users but what they found in New Jersey
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
when they opened up to many users or
 
04:12:50.670 --> 04:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
many operators is that you had players
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for the offers they were trained
 
04:12:54.990 --> 04:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
to wait for an offer to get a free BET
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
$300 if I deposit 10 I get 50 bucks and
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
they weren't playing as much they were
 
04:13:02.109 --> 04:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
just waiting for and you found the
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
acquisition costs for The Operators to
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
be so high like our our acquisition
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
costs in New Hampshire are very low it's
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
like $20 a customer in New Jersey it's
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
like 3,000
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
and I do know that they also got blasted
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
with advertising and I really wanted to
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
avoid that I mean we get political
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
anyway and so Sports spinning I you
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
probably watch sports events and all the
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
ads that are run there it would have
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
been like that 247 up here so I don't
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
think it's so much to your point I don't
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
think it's so much as the not multiple
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
operators as it we could see the heat
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
map and the Portsmith traffic circle and
 
04:13:41.149 --> 04:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
the mall in nashwa and the liquor store
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
in nsha were like the most visited
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
places for sports betting and I think
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
folks are driving up here betting
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting a bottle of liquor and you know
 
04:13:53.460 --> 04:13:53.470 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.470 --> 04:13:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
state yes representative Spar thank you
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned I guess that you
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
following up on uh representative toet
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
on the sports betting uh the state was
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
the second most profitable in sports
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
betting uh next to New York yes how do
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
you define that profitable
 
04:14:16.590 --> 04:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
is that um per capita is it is per
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
capita yeah so I have a I have a graph
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
and it's um so for example our sisters
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
in Maine per capita state revenue is two
 
04:14:28.479 --> 04:14:30.349 align:start position:0%
in Maine per capita state revenue is two
um

04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
$33.79 and we're
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
$25 so literally per every human being
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
in the state we're $25 a profitability
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
for sports bending in main is
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
three thank you yeah like they made 5
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
million last year we made
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
30 uh
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
34 so that's New York us and then DC and
 
04:14:58.349 --> 04:14:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
order okay seeing no other questions
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.960 --> 04:15:41.910 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
today as you know the fishing game
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
department is mostly self-funded and we
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
rely heavily upon the unrestricted
 
04:18:27.149 --> 04:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
component of being
 
04:18:31.109 --> 04:18:31.119 align:start position:0%
self-funded so the unrestricted revenues
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
are used to fund the operations of the
 
04:18:36.670 --> 04:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
department not funded by restricted
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
revenues such as Federal revenues
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and arpa projects the
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
large use of unrestricted revenues are
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
personnel and Associated benefits
 
04:18:50.429 --> 04:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
transfers to the Department of
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
Information Technology as well as
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
insurance I have a few unrestricted
 
04:19:02.590 --> 04:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue percentages relative to the
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that just closed June 30th
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
2024 we had actual expenditures of just
 
04:19:14.429 --> 04:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
under $40 million of of which
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
39.4% was paid for using unrestricted
 
04:19:21.630 --> 04:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
revenues for our current budgeted fiscal
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
year our expenditures are authorized at
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
just over $41 million of which
 
04:19:33.630 --> 04:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
18.2 million is budgeted as as
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue or
 
04:19:40.349 --> 04:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
43.7% for the future operating budget
 
04:19:43.109 --> 04:19:43.119 align:start position:0%
that we submitted to the governor during

our agency
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
phase our expenses went up considerably
 
04:19:51.109 --> 04:19:51.119 align:start position:0%
and that was mainly due to the personel
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
in benefit increases that were passed
 
04:19:56.990 --> 04:19:57.000 align:start position:0%

43% the fishing game unrestricted fund
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
has approximately 13 individual
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
categories of unrestricted revenues that
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
make up that big pot certainly the
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
largest is
 
04:20:33.630 --> 04:20:33.640 align:start position:0%

about and how much was deposited into
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
those categories of revenue for fiscal
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
year 25 I have the budgeted but then the
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
green two numbers on the bottom of that
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
column those are actual transfers for
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
the ohrv and Marine unref unded road
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
toll that we have received this fiscal
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
year and for fiscal year 26 and 27 that
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
is our budgeted request that we
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
submitted through the agency phase of
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
the governor of the uh budget
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
process so with that I would be happy to
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.880 --> 04:22:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:22:18.910 --> 04:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
set thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious as
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
to it and you mentioned that it's a
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
substantial uh figure the uh recoveries
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
from federal grants can you give us a
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
little daylight on what those dollars
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
are where they come from what the grants
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
are absolutely a million dollars that's
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial it is we have
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 plus federal grants
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
coming into the department our main
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
entity we receive those from is the fish
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
and wildlife service we also have grants
 
04:22:51.680 --> 04:22:52.590 align:start position:0%
and wildlife service we also have grants
from

04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
Noah and every year we are we put
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
together a proposal to the feds to be
 
04:23:05.550 --> 04:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
able to assess an indirect charge on
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
those grants and it runs between 18 and
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
20% of our Personnel cost so if I our
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost for any one Grant is a
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars we're able to assess up
 
04:23:22.229 --> 04:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
to 20% of overhead charges and those
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
funds are deposited into this
 
04:23:24.199 --> 04:23:25.630 align:start position:0%
funds are deposited into this
unrestricted

04:23:25.630 --> 04:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
account does that answer your question
 
04:23:28.199 --> 04:23:31.070 align:start position:0%
account does that answer your question
sir

04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
sir

okay represent
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
ery one of the aspects that you didn't
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
mention was search and rescue that is
 
04:23:42.109 --> 04:23:42.119 align:start position:0%
not part of this search and rescue is a
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
dedic ated account and has no bearing on
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted fishing gain fund thank
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
welcome yes representative Bolton thanks

what's the conquered agent
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
fee our in RSA licensed agents are able
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
to charge $1 per license type
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
transaction at their establishments okay
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
so when we sell licenses across the
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
front counter at our headquarters on 11
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hazen drive that $1 is paid to
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
us you have 7,000 anticipating 7,000 of
 
04:24:29.309 --> 04:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
those any other
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:24:33.309 --> 04:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
much well thank you thank you very much
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
just got to tie into talking
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
thanks so I just wanted to tie this um
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
last page back to the discussion you had
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the treasurer earlier if you go
 
04:25:14.349 --> 04:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
down to to on the left- hand side at
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
6956 interest on savings
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
deposits the treasurer talked about how
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
she will take what fund she has
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
available to earn interest on and then
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
dedicate it to certain funds that
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
require that per statute the fishing
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
game fund is one of those um dedicated
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
funds that would get interest as a
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
revenue Source from those Investments
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
the treasurer makes so it would go into
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
the general fund at first and then the
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
next month it gets transferred over to
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
to the fishing game fund or whatever
 
04:25:45.550 --> 04:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund it is in this case it's
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
just the fishing game and I just wanted
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
to point that out to you um so this is a
 
04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
healthy amount this will will start to
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
decrease in the out years um so again I
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to tie that conversation
 
04:25:59.109 --> 04:25:59.119 align:start position:0%
from earlier today about the treasure
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
talk with her interest that she earns
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
and how it goes into different funds
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
here's an example of it being put into
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of the dedicated funds um the other
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
thing I I
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
think less interesting for you but just
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
to know is that um um Kathy presented
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
that about $18 million of um
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Fish and Game funds are
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
being used to fund their operations
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
proposed in 26 and 27 their revenue
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
projections are only $14 million in
 
04:26:29.790 --> 04:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
those two years there's a surplus in the
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund not a huge Surplus but
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
enough to get them over the hump for the
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
next two years um some of you may be
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
aware that through the summer and fall
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
there was a committee that was working
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
on ideas to to help the agency fund um
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
its operations because the fishing game
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
fund over the long term may not be able
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
to handle that but I just wanted to
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
point that out if you go back and look
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
at later you know this evening when
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're at home and you're like oh geez
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
there was some interesting things and
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
you see 18 million it's not a typo
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's what it cost them to to run the
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game department under their
 
04:27:05.229 --> 04:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funds they just don't
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
generate that Revenue each year they had
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
a surplus that they're bringing forward
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they're paying on those costs
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification yes
 
04:27:15.359 --> 04:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification yes
represent

04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
Ames I think I should have asked this
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
question in the first round here but um
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering on the federal recoveries
 
04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
indirect costs which is fairly
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
significant number amongst these numbers
 
04:27:37.229 --> 04:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
um whether there's any risk or concern
 
04:27:40.750 --> 04:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the agency that the federal funds
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
from which these indirect cost transfers
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
come from are uh at risk that we have an
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
incoming Federal Administration that's
 
04:27:55.950 --> 04:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
doing a more complete review of budgeted
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
items than is typical and maybe or maybe
 
04:28:03.790 --> 04:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
not you can tell me um this these
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
particular uh grants that from which
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
this money derives are at risk or not is
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
this something that you worry about I
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
guess is what I'm asking not at this
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
point in time the majority of these
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
funds come from Pitman Robertson in
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
Dingle Johnson act which go way way back
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
as a federal law so it's not they're not
 
04:28:26.760 --> 04:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
as a federal law so it's not they're not
annual

04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
apportionments a a portion to the
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
department they are um they go way back
 
04:28:38.670 --> 04:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
in law on the federal side so we are not
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerned that they will
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
disappear that's good news thank
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
shamberg okay represent
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
Wars uh thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you mentioned the
 
04:28:59.950 --> 04:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
Robinson Pitman act and uh it funds what
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
about 11 it's 11 and a half% or 11% tax
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
on the purchase of Sporting Goods so are

we able to collect any taxes on the
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes in from overseas that
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
people may be buying through Amazon.com
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
or some of these other websites are we
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
just losing that
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue the answer to that yeah at this
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
point so I don't know the current status
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
of that I know that that was something
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
that was being looked into as a loss of
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue at the federal level and I don't
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
know where that committee is on that
 
04:29:33.870 --> 04:29:33.880 align:start position:0%

83-foot yes thank you Mr chairman for a
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
multitude of reasons this uh this bill
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
isolates one specific uh betting
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
platform sports betting we have what I
 
05:16:19.948 --> 05:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
believe is a a commission that's going
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
to pass this does not change charitable
 
05:16:25.548 --> 05:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
gaming people that can bet on those
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
games of
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
chance um and I think it's something
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
that can be Revisited by that
 
05:16:35.310 --> 05:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh tertiary to that we're
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
having a revenue issue as it stands and
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
I can just see revenues going down with
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation as written at
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
present and I just think it's something
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
that the newly formed commission can
 
05:16:49.080 --> 05:16:52.510 align:start position:0%
that the newly formed commission can
take

05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:55.750 --> 05:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
up representative shamberg uh Mr
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be uh opposing the
 
05:17:04.510 --> 05:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
itl uh I think it's important that we
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
make a statement concerning the age
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.230 --> 05:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
um tobacco products Vapes and uh
 
05:17:19.948 --> 05:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to drag it out any I'll
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
just write the borb on The Minority
 
05:17:23.520 --> 05:17:25.030 align:start position:0%

Report

05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
Report
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
Bas basically supporting the age of
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.670 --> 05:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
just I was just I was just looking for
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
the um fiscal impact it looks like um
 
05:17:46.520 --> 05:17:48.670 align:start position:0%
the um fiscal impact it looks like um
640,000

05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
640,000
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
decrease it's 320 the first year fiscal
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
year 26 and
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
640 I think in the fiscal year 27 which
 
05:17:59.868 --> 05:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
is a wash compared to the amount of
 
05:18:12.548 --> 05:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:14.830 --> 05:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
