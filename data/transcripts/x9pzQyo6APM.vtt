thank you mr chair uh thank you senator
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
ward for
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
would there be uh one
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
blanket mou between the charter school
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%

mou for each uh child with a disability
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the charter school
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
very good question i would think that it
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
has to do with each individual because
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
each individual child will have
 
00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.110 align:start position:0%
each individual child will have
different

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
needs but it needs to be addressed and
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
shared between the dissenting district
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
school and the accepting
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
charter public charter school
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
further questions of senator ward yes
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
the last part lines 50 16 and 17.
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
i'm particularly concerned with the
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
notification on 16 and
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
if a youngster with disabilities uh to
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
receive services what happens if the
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
two-week deadline can't be met at that
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
point right before school opens
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh you're looking at the bill amended by
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
the senate i'm looking at the back of
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that was distributed this
 
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
the bill that was distributed this
morning

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
the line it talks about the two week the
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
two week uh period prior to start of
 
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
two week uh period prior to start of
school

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
if a youngster is if that mou or the
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
review doesn't happen that two weeks
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
could you state that again
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.509 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
lines 16 and 17 are talking about a
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
two-week review um
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
for youngsters with special education
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
plans or in a shot of public school
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
and it's in the last two weeks two weeks
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
before school starts and my question is
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
what happens if that doesn't occur
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
during that time frame
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
well i think that is the reason we have
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is because that has occurred
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
so the receiving charter
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
ends up with a child with disabilities
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
and they have really not very little
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
they have earlier information on what to
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
do and i think this bill will put it in
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
writing that they have to meet they have
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
to have an mou between the sending
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
school district and receiving charter
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
school as so
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
so it has to take place
 
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.430 align:start position:0%
so it has to take place
okay

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
senator ward i i have one question here
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
um where
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
if the mou
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
is done prior to
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
that meeting
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
or even after it
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
language and lines 9 through
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
11 speak to the what the mou may contain
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
it may contain services that will be
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
provide provided
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
where the server school district will
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
provide the services directly and if
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it through a
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
contracted service
 
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
contracted service
if

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
those are usually decisions which are
 
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.630 align:start position:0%
those are usually decisions which are
made

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
during the iep process
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
and written into the iep
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
uh so i would assume then the mou and
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong please the
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
mou is is is
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
done after the iep or you see i'm a
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
little confused whether it's done prior
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
to or or pri afterwards if it's
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
afterwards then this is stuff's already
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the iep
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
is so is the mou primarily then
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
established for the purpose of
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
notification that we will be having a
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
meeting and the meeting will be
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
conducted where my understanding is that
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a child who has
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
spent time in the public school system
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
and is now moving to a public charter
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
school so he he or she has already had a
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
plan and that plan needs to be reviewed
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
and discussed with the accepting charter
 
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.150 align:start position:0%
and discussed with the accepting charter
school

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
school
so

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned you can discuss
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
this more than two weeks before if you
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
know that the child is moving over
 
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.430 align:start position:0%
know that the child is moving over
then

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
anytime you can sit down and talk about
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
it the better it is
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up then it's it's my concern
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
though that
 
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.590 align:start position:0%
though that
the

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
these types of things are decided at the
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
iep meeting by all those that are
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
required by law to be there
 
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
required by law to be there
um

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
then if it's done prior to the
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
iep are we then conducting another iep
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
prior to the iep
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh i i i can't answer that
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know okay thank you
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
rep san luna
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
you very much senator ward for uh for
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
being with us this morning um i see um
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
in the um in the the bill docket for uh
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
for 238 that there were three amendments
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
um to it um leading up to the uh the
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended by the senate and i
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could talk a little
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
bit about the um the cooperation or
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration collaboration with um with
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
school administrators and uh special ed
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh special education administrators
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the development of uh the amendments
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
that lead the bill that we're seeing
 
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
that lead the bill that we're seeing
today

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
there was quite a discussion
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
between the needs of the charter schools
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
who felt that they were never really
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
told ahead of time and not enough time
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
for them to plan what kinds of services
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
that the child would need to have that's
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
why we have at least two weeks
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
beforehand there certainly was input
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the school administrators and from
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
special education teachers and at one
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
point i know that senator khan had
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
talked to the
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
special education teachers and they
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
essentially said yeah two weeks is okay
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
but it would be better to have this
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
conference this mou before even at 30
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
days before the school starts
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
so there were a lot of people involved
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the and the department of education
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
you senator ward um when when is a
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
school actually
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
notified that a student has gone to a
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
charter school
um

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
so they're they're a member of the
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the public school and then they
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
decide sometime to to enter charter
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
school and go through that acceptance
 
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
school and go through that acceptance
process

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
process
when

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
do they know
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
like a month ahead of time before or do
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh find out like the day of the first
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
day of class
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering how this two-week
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
i am assuming based on my understanding
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
of these things that the charter schools
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
opened you know you can apply to the
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
charter school and if there is a space
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
and you qualify for that space then they
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
can start then they can initiate the mou
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
then they know that the child is coming
 
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.269 align:start position:0%
then they know that the child is coming
over

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
i doubt that it happens the day before
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
unless men i've seen
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
cases where some this
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
severely disabled child comes into the
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
public school system and they had not
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
planned for it and all of a sudden the
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
second semester here you have an
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
additional child which raises a lot of
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as how you pay for it
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
and how how you take care of it so
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the receiving
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
charter school will know beforehand if
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
the child comes from the public school
 
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
the child comes from the public school
system

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent cornell
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
so then it would be up to the charter
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
school to notify the public school that
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
a student has registered and and to get
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
this process going
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is the way it has been and i think
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
the charter school would like to know
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
from the sending school that this child
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
is leaving and coming to the charter
 
00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
is leaving and coming to the charter
school

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and the charter school can then talk to
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
them and set up a time and discuss you
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
know a mutually acceptable time for them
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
to sit down and discuss this child's
 
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.670 align:start position:0%
to sit down and discuss this child's
needs

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
further questions yes yes but i'm
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that the charter school knows
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
before the public school does that the
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
child is leaving the public school and
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to the charter school because
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
they've been accepted and then the
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
charter school will notify the public
 
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.749 align:start position:0%
charter school will notify the public
school

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
that that they need to set up this
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
meeting to do this
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that works i don't know
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
if the public school
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
if some if a parent comes and tells it
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
comes and tells the public school we're
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
taking our child out
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we're going to transfer him or her
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
to this other school
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
i would think that
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think a child shows up in the
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
without having notified the public
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
school because of the
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
education money that is involved
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%

of the new hampshire association of
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
special ed administrators here
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
representing over 280 leaders in the
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
field of special education
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
my testimony is going around i will keep
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
it short
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
our association does see the value of an
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
mou but the bill as written
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
raises a lot of questions and
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
needs quite a bit more clarity the first
 
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
needs quite a bit more clarity the first
thing

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
is around some of the conversation that
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
just happened in regards to an mou being
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one agreement versus an
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
agreement between the district and the
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
charter school in regards to the
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
provision of special education
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
we were under the impression that this
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
was an mou that would be a agreement
 
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
was an mou that would be a agreement
between

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
the two entities now it seems as though
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking one-on-one which doesn't
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
seem relevant when kids already have an
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
iep which
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
covers the the specifics of the the
 
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.110 align:start position:0%
covers the the specifics of the the
child

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
also um in looking at the bill there was
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
a you know a lot of questions around
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
this two week uh prior to school
 
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.549 align:start position:0%
this two week uh prior to school
starting

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
kids enter into charter schools at all
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
time of the year so a bill that states
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks prior to the start of the
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
school year may not be relevant for
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
many of the the children who are
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
many of the the children who are
enrolling

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
enrolling
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
um also we'd like to say that you know
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the leas we fully understand
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
our responsibility in terms of the
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
provision of special education services
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
is requiring an mou which we wouldn't
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
oppose but there really isn't any
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
evidence that there's been a pattern of
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
non-compliance in terms of our school
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
districts not adhering to their
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and their obligation for
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
the provision of special education
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
services to students with disabilities
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and so for this reason uh we wouldn't
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
really see that this is necessary and
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
would open it up to any of you for uh
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have for me
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the special ed administrators
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.390 align:start position:0%
being here
if

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
a child
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
is in a public school and then enrolls
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
in a charter school there would be an
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
existing iep
 
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.150 align:start position:0%
existing iep
but

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
when they go to the charter school one
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the main issues we've heard from
 
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.430 align:start position:0%
of the main issues we've heard from
parents

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.789 align:start position:0%
parents
is

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
where the services are provided now that
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be in the um
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
iep unless there's a new iep
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the school year so
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that would be one of the main
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
things that would be covered in the mou
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
as to where the services are to be
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
provided because they're now in a
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
charter school but the resident district
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the services
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
certainly would be a good example of
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
what could be contained in a memorandum
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
of understanding we wouldn't be opposed
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
to that i mean that's something that we
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
talk about with the charter schools and
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chamberlain good morning how
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
are you doing um this is a quick
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
question i i
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for speaking because i was i
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
was confused as i was reading the mou
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
and i asked my associate here three
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
times and she made it more confusing
 
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:20.789 align:start position:0%
times and she made it more confusing
so

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you clarifying that i
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't see one on one or one on i
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
didn't understand the whole the concept
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
that um i want to refer back to um
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's question
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
though uh
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
when where the servers are going to be
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
provided this says that the doe will
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
provide a guide create a guide document
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
but i thought the services provided
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be if it's going to be one
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
standard template that would be wouldn't
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
be there because every district is going
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be different so i'm not sure how that
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
would work but
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the iep
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
am i wrong that the or do i understand
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
correctly that when the services when
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
you negotiate the service with the
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
parent and the youngsters
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
in the schools this service are going to
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
be provided here because that's the only
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
place we have it the server's going to
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
be provided there and that's all
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the location yes it's the
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
actual service itself so if you know
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
they need orton gillingham reading and
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
the charter school can't provide that
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
they decide if the provider is going to
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
go to the school right or if the child
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
is going to go back to the public school
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's all part of that conversation yes
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's agreed upon and the iap
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
and the parents sign off yeah i don't
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
understand what the mou would do to that
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know if from my lens um you know an
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
example would be in an mou knowing the
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
schedule when the service providers are
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to show up so it's not you know
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
random and the charter school doesn't
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
get surprise
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
um or or if they're going to leave to go
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
to the public school that that's agreed
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
upon and it's not disruptive to the
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
child that's a reasonable
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
agreement to have all right thank you
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you um i have a
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
question for you um in the past we've
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from various folks that
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's taking quite a while before the
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
service is delivered to this child at
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
the charter school for example a new
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
child that moves in that has multiple
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
handicaps came in from another state
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's not that charter school
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
so my concerns go back still to is this
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
an agreement but
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
on a one-on-one regarding each child or
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
is it an agreement between
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
one organization to another organization
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
generally how we're going to conduct
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
our relationship here
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
and it goes into the question regarding
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
contracted services if it's a one-on-one
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's virtually impossible
 
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.549 align:start position:0%
i think it's virtually impossible
to

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
identify and i know it says may contain
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's not saying shall contain
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
but if you're a small district that
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a person person's going to
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
deal with an orthopedic handicap or a
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury or a multiple
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
handicap that this child has
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have to do it
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
probably through a contracted service
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
but you don't know that until you're in
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
the iep meeting and you're dealing with
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
it seeing you've never seen that iep
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
before it came in from another state
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
so how would we respond and how would we
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
work this into the
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one between
 
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one between
no

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
organization and organization at the
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
beginning year i think that's virtually
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
impossible to do
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and you bring
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
up an important fact that you know we're
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
so short staffed in the state of new
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire when it comes to special
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
education service providers whether it
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
be in our public schools or charter
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
schools so
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
in some situations yes it's very
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
difficult to get those services started
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
on time i think folks do a really good
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
job of documenting every effort to get
 
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.710 align:start position:0%
job of documenting every effort to get
those

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
and to your point about duplication
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
one-on-one agreements
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
we're confused about that too
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of what that would look like
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
when you already have an iep which is
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
basically the legal
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
document i'm not sure what a one-on-one
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding would
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
contain we've had some
 
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.990 align:start position:0%
contain we've had some
really

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
strong conversations with the department
 
00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
strong conversations with the department
um

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
very productive conversations about what
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
might be in an mou
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i think becky ferdet could probably
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
expand on that we've tossed around some
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable ideas i'm not quite sure that
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
the charter school association is on
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
board with this and she can probably
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
give you more information about that
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
but truly an mou is an agreement between
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
all of the organizations involved and
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's collaborative in nature
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that the charter
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
schools even want this kind of mou
 
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
schools even want this kind of mou
agreement

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the further questions
 
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for the further questions
representatives

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
i have two questions if that's okay one
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
is when are ieps usually done
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
um you know every district has a
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
different cycle some do them
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
um by birth date some do them you know
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
by the end of the school year so it's
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
truly left up to the school district and
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
parent they have to be done every year
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
but some districts schedule them
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the school year some wait and
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
do them all towards the end of the
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
school year so it varies
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
so but there normally would be
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
prior to the following year is that
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
am i understanding you right
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
like if it's here yeah but i mean like
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
if it's done if most of them do it
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the year
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
then the school the next year would know
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
what was expected at the beginning of
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
the year is that my in my understanding
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
right what the charter school would
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
expect no no no if you don't know let's
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
say you don't know the kids going into
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
the charter school yet you're in the
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
public school
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
and you do the iep at the regular iep
 
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.350 align:start position:0%
and you do the iep at the regular iep
time

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
and then the parent once decides that
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
the next year they're going to go
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
to the charter school with the iep
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
normally have already been done
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
again it's it's by the district we have
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of school districts who are not
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
doing their meetings at the end of the
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
year just simply because there's a
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
backload and service providers are taken
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
away from kids so they're trying really
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
hard to stagger them throughout the
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
school year okay
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
but so then that's well that was the uh
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
i was first or the second question that
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
was the first question i was trying to
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure i understood that that's the
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
second one and the second one is
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
could the mou be done at
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
i mean if you know the kid is going to
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
the charter school or is in the charter
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
school could the mou and the ib iep be
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
done at the same meeting
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's my second question
 
00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
that's my second question
um

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure what a one-on-one mou
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
would contain so it's hard to answer
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome are there
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
further questions represented moffatt
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ms
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
bergeron for being here um in your
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony which i'm reading you said
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
that your organization would welcome the
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to collaborate with doe and
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
the public charter schools to work on
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
the template
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the mou expectations so my question
 
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
in the mou expectations so my question
is

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
do you see an opportunity in the short
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
term given we have a timeline to perhaps
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
work up an amendment or some language
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
that one of us could uh submit so that
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
we could discuss an amendment um
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
that would be to your liking we could
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
certainly go back to our association
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
members and talk with the department
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
about that um but right now there's
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
so many questions for us that are you
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
know not clear um but we could certainly
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
go back and talk with our members
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further further
 
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further further
questions

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
you um we do have uh becky here as a
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
technical support however jerry fruit do
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
you want to prior to from the school

have becky come up from the department
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
sure mr chairman thank you for the
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is jerry fru
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
associate executive director with the
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
school administrators association nice
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
to see you all again i won't take a lot
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
of time i had not prep i had not
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
prepared uh to speak at all on this this
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
morning because
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
until it was presented
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
i thought i understood what was being
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
presented but then there's confusion
 
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
presented but then there's confusion
around

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
we view the mou as an organizational
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
document and in terms of how
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
organizations are going to interact to
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
provide services to kids we
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
never saw the mou as a one to one
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
document to begin with we see that as
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
the iep and within the iep you identify
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
services that need to be be provided but
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
then the overarching umbrella of the mou
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
would address how those services would
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything to hand out
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
because we have we are concerned if the
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
mou was indeed a one-on-one document
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
and frankly i'm i'm a bit surprised that
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
the charter school folks on here i would
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
envision this to be a pretty onerous
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the positive charter
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
schools and i think about
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
one where our grandchildren went i i
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
believe that they dealt with 17
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
different communities and i can't
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
imagine that they have the bandwidth to
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
deal with perhaps you know uh 20 or 30
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
of their students in over 17 different
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
communities dealing with a one-on-one
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
mou i
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
i would i would just my heart would
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
bleed for what they have to go through
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i think the organizational piece of
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
the mou is the important part and and um
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
that i'll say thank you very much are
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
there questions of these yes represent
 
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.149 align:start position:0%
there questions of these yes represent
luno

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
luno
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure thanks very much mr chair and
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um um jerry for for
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
being with us this morning um
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm
 
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.149 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm
i

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
i don't um see where the one-on-one uh
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
part is in here but but let's just just
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
for the sake of the question
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh assume that that we're talking about
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
an mou that's between
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
a uh school district and a truck and a
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
chartered a charter school
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
not a not on a per student basis but
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
just an agreement um how would how would
 
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
just an agreement um how would how would
this

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
um bill
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
do anything beyond what is currently in
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
existing law and referenced in the bill
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
at 194 b colon 11 roman 3 c
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
which says and the chartered public
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
schools shall cooperate with the child's
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
resident district in the provision of
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
the ch of the child special education
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
and related services thank you for that
 
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
and related services thank you for that
question

00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
question
representative

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
i do think there
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
and we we see value in the mou piece
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
itself because it does it would offer
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to clearly explain uh
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the get-go uh who's responsible for
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
what and and it would allow i believe
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address some of the
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
staffing shortages are real and they're
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
real in our schools and when a special
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
education teacher leaves partway through
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
the year and that has happened on on a
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
number of occasions not only does that
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
leave the
 
00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
leave the
local

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
resident district in the lurch but it
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
also leaves the charter school services
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the lurch and so those are those are
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
real things that are going to happen and
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be addressed in an mou
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
with a mutual understanding and
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
agreement that if we have a vacancy xyz
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be the process so that so
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
that the adversarial relationship you
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
know between you know you have the
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
charter school folks saying we need the
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
services for the kids and then you have
 
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.990 align:start position:0%
services for the kids and then you have
the

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
the resident district saying yes but we
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff we don't we've just
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
lost services to our kids as well
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day they are all our
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
kids whether they're charter school or
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
whether they're resident schools and
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's imp the imperative is to
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
provide the services and the mou is the
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address that
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
those issues that may come up and say
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay this is how we're gonna work this
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
out as opposed to having hard feelings
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and accusations that well you're not you
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
know doing xyz well
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i think the mou is an opportunity but
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
i it's just not ready for prime time as
 
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.909 align:start position:0%
i it's just not ready for prime time as
as

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard say in this
 
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
we've heard say in this
party

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative uh waltz
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh what i have is actually more of a
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
comment than a question and i think the
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
pro one of the confusion here
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
comes from the drafting and the bill and
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that on line three
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
it refers to a student
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
on line seven it refers to students
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
plural to students and then down on line
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
16 it says a student again so the bill
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent whether we're talking
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
about an individual agreement or
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
agreement overriding overarching
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
agreement for all students and i just
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out that i think
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
that may be where some of the confusion
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock thank
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
you chairman good morning i just want to
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
follow up on your your uh inference
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
about a charter school having multiple
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
school districts uh i think you use the
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
term 17
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
coming to one charter school which could
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
clearly happen
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
would it be your understanding in this
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill does that mean there would be 17
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
different mous
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
if there were 17 districts yes so they
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
could be particularly completely
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
different and if there were one-on-one
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
students in each of the 17 districts
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh jerry uh on line six through
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
or excuse me five through nine there is
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
a sentence
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
which i think that sentence alone deals
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
with the organizational to
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
organizational units
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
talking about cooperating in conjunction
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the statute
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
and the types of services for students
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
legislation were boiled down to this
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
particular area would your organization
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
we support the idea of having the
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
agreements and and see where that could
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
be valuable but we need it needs to be
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
very clear yeah thank you
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes represent luna thank you very much
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
and um and i i think uh chair ladd's uh
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
question there i think is was was very
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
helpful as well as your answer jerry
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
would um would a would it would a
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
an mou that was really specific to be
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
between a district and a charter
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
not on a student-specific basis um
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
and you suggested that it it could could
 
00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.190 align:start position:0%
and you suggested that it it could could
address

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
what would happen if staffing um
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh changes were made or or or have
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
happened would it also possibly include
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement agreement for
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and things like that
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think that's the
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's the opportunity that the mou
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
would provide okay and and it's not not
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
on a student-specific basis but on a on
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
we we do have becky coming up also okay
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
we can take input from either one or
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
i was in re-reading it
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
based on the things that you were saying
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
and everybody was saying
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the mou is between
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the charter school
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
but that two weeks prior to the charter
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
school say you have a kid with an iep
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
that has something that you didn't
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
consider it says it shall be reviewed
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
so it seems like it's a little of each
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
that when you have a particular kid
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
you're gonna just review the moe and
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
make sure this kid's covered by the
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
agreement in case there was something
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
you didn't think of that's
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
i guess my reading of it
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
what do you i just wondered if you've
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
gone through this what do you think
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative i
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure and i i know
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
that legislative intent is a big deal
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and given the the way this unraveled
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
this morning a little bit i'm not quite
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
certain what the legislative intent is
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that needs to be clarified
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
before this goes any further that's the
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
perfect question for somebody other than
 
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
perfect question for somebody other than
me

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh i think
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do now is go to
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
becky from the department quickly and
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
see if there's any technical questions
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning it's monday
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
i think that uh for the record my name
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
is rebecca fred i'm the state director
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
of special education um
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
um our understanding of this this
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
document was that the mou would be a um
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
one document for each school district
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
that the chartered school works with i
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
think that our when we spoke with both
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of special
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
education directors and chartered school
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
organization we had discussed how we
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
really needed a clarification of
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
what that that cooperation between the
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
two entities would look like a ch an iep
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
is going to tell you the frequency
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
duration and setting of a service that
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
is provided but the setting is going to
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
be a regular education setting a special
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
education setting so while you may
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
discuss in a meeting
 
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
discuss in a meeting
that

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
orton gillingham is going to be provided
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
back at the regular school that isn't
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
always what the discussion is in the iep
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
team meeting so this would be where
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
you're clarifying that
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
i have we have six students that need
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
orton gillingham instruction it's going
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
to be easier for us to send that
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
instructor to the charter school to
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
provide services then take all of those
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
students back here so it's it wasn't
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
intended to to be a kind of one-on-one
 
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:38.230 align:start position:0%
intended to to be a kind of one-on-one
um

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
document it was intended to say
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
overarching if we look at our six
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
students that come to your school how
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
are we going to work together to get
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
these services in place am i going to
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
contract with you am i going to contract
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
with somebody else am i going to send my
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
own person from my own district to come
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
do these services so it was really those
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
logistics because that was what we had
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
heard was the concern there wasn't the
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
concern with the iep or what the
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
services were stated in the iep there
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
was the concern of how those logistics
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
were kind of figured out and and
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
determined between the school district
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the chartered organization because
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
they we found many times there was a
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
different interpretation of what had
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
been discussed and so this was kind of
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
putting it into a document and saying
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
clearly this is what your responsibility
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
is this is what your responsibility is
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that there was no misunderstanding
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
three six months down the road when one
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
entity received a bill from the other
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
one or one entity asked for payment for
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
something else it was to very clearly
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
state this is what you have said you're
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to do this is what you have said
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to do
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
the other right person to ask this but
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
my mind has been trying to
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
get around the fact that somebody a
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
charter school might have kids from 17
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
different districts and so 17 different
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
districts will be providing
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
special education services to the
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
children at the charter school
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
in my experience in the classroom
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the regular public school when there
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
were a group of children who had the
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
same sort of needs the the group would
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
meet as
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
because of staffing and needing to be
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
efficient so all five kids from five
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
different classrooms would all go to the
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
special ed room and get the service that
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
in the charter school with 17 different
 
00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:32.790 align:start position:0%
in the charter school with 17 different
districts

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
if there are 17 kids all with the same
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
special ed need do they all get serviced
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
by their individual district then or
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's what that mou would clarify so if
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
they if you with that scenario if you
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
had 17 students who needed orton
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
gillingham instruction i'm just going to
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
keep building off of jane's conversation
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
and they needed orton gillingham
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
instruction the charter school could say
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
i have two from you and two from you and
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
two from you we're willing to you know
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you can all contribute we're willing
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
to hire a teacher to teach those 17
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
students so that i'm not making i'm not
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
having you send somebody and i'm having
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
you pay for something and i'm having you
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
take the kids back to your school we're
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
trying to make that agreement so that
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's easier to say
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know you all need this i'll agree
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
with you to do this and there may be
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
some nuances though if you have a
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
student who has a one-on-one in one
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
district but maybe not in another
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
district so it's clarifying those but it
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
would give them the opportunity to also
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
say we can do this because we have all
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
of these students that need that same
 
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
of these students that need that same
service

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
question

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
building on the examples we're using
 
00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.470 align:start position:0%
building on the examples we're using
uh

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
with 17 school districts sending
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
students to a chiro school
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
even if it's a an agreement between the
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
district and the charter school we're
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
talking about 17 separate agreements is
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
that correct yes but it wouldn't be a it
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be less than if you took all 30
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
kids that came from those 17 schools and
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
wrote 30 individual
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
mouss so that was why we did that's
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
another thing is it's only going to be
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the district they already have to
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
cooperate with that district and they're
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
already making these agreements so it's
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
just putting it into a
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
document follow-up uh quick follow-up so
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh actually the number of mouss that
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
would be in place
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
is determined by the number of school
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
districts sending students to that
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
charter school yes they should be
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
getting could be getting
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
students from 25 districts there had to
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
be 25 mous at that point is that the
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
highest i've heard is is 14 or 17 so but
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes it could thank you jeff santana
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
question my question is about the guide
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
that the doe is
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to develop and provide
 
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
supposed to develop and provide
um

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
could you tell me
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
kind of explain to me a little bit about
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
that guide is going to be developed and
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
what exactly might be in that is is it
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
kind of open-ended questions or is it uh
 
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.870 align:start position:0%
kind of open-ended questions or is it uh
prescriptive

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
we would want to collaborate with both
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
the charter schools and most likely the
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
association of special ed directors to
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're getting some clear
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions in there but it really would
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
state where services are going to be
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
provided for the students so is it going
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be that
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
the students are at the charter school
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
or that the students are going back to
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
the resident district um who's paying
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
for portions of those if you agree that
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
the child is going to receive the
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
services there are you then contracting
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
with that chartered school to pay them a
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
portion of that um
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
it so really just clarify as it those
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
those details of how you're cooperating
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to send the students
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
there yes we're going to pay you for
 
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.910 align:start position:0%
there yes we're going to pay you for
this

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
um or
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
any of those details that that may not
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
be worked out in your iep team meeting
 
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.870 align:start position:0%
be worked out in your iep team meeting
yes

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um and how is that mediated uh
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
if there's like strong disagreement
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
which we've heard in the past between
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
the charter school and the sending
 
00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:03.750 align:start position:0%
the charter school and the sending
district

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.630 align:start position:0%
district
uh

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
there is no um there's no mechanism for
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
a mediation of that they
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
this the chart the um
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
the district is responsible for those
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
services so they need to be able to
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
determine how they're going to provide
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
those services
 
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
those services
um

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
they could always ask for our support
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that we would i
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
mean there ultimately they have to
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
provide the services this is just how
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to provide them
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.390 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
nancy thank you very much
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
i do not have any other pink cards on
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
i apologize i was not going to speak on
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
this but there's a few things i'd like
 
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.589 align:start position:0%
this but there's a few things i'd like
to

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
just offer the committee for the record
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
becky wilson from new hampshire school
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
boards association
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
i would agree with the previous speakers
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
that when this bill was originally
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
discussed in senate education
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think the majority of people felt that
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
mou was really a district and charter
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
school level
 
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.430 align:start position:0%
school level
document

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
different districts have different
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
resources different charter schools have
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
different resources in our minds the mou
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
is really
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
about global decision making in terms of
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for what decisions
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
between the charter school and the local
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
district from a more of a school board
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
perspective and more of a management
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
things like who's hiring the staff who's
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for hiring certain staff
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for supervising that
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
staff member if they are a district
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
employee versus a charter school
 
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.069 align:start position:0%
employee versus a charter school
employee

00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
who's setting the rate i think that was
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
brought up previously
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
what's the collaboration between the
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
public charter school and the local
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
district in terms of supervision of the
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
staff evaluation
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
and to just try to clarify and limit
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
confusion between charter schools and
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
local districts about decision making
 
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:02.550 align:start position:0%
local districts about decision making
authority

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
in our minds the iep team is the one
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is making the decisions for student
 
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.150 align:start position:0%
that is making the decisions for student
level

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
decision making where services are going
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
to be provided what are the services
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
what needs to be translated from when
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the student was in the local public
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
school to the charter school how might
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
things look different
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
those are all iep team decisions and the
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
iep team is required to meet when the
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
student enrolls
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
at the public charter school
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
there was also some discussion
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
previously about
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
you may have students at public charter
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
schools who do not require special ed
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
services so not every school district is
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to automatically have an mou with
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
every public charter school you're only
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to enter into this
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
once you know that you have a student
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
who has enrolled in the public charter
 
00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:48.390 align:start position:0%
who has enrolled in the public charter
school

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
that may not be prior to the start of
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
the school year while that's ideal i
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
think for most people that's not always
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
the case there are students that
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
move during the school year or enroll
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
and there was quite a bit of discussion
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
about this two weeks prior to the school
 
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.710 align:start position:0%
about this two weeks prior to the school
year

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh if it's going to be
 
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh if it's going to be
between

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.829 align:start position:0%
between
the

00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
district staff for example the special
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
education director or the superintendent
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the administrator at the local
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
public charter school
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
those people are available over the
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
summer but if there's some expectation
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
that there's other people involved not
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
all of those people are available prior
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
to the school year starting
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
and not all of those decisions um you
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
know at the student level necessarily
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
made prior to the start of the school
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
year so i just wanted to clarify that
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
from from the school board's perspective
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this as a
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to other mousse that you
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
might have for example with the police
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
department if you have a school resource
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
officer about who's doing what uh who's
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for what decisions
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
who makes the final call etc so i'm
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you miss whitley for
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
being here and this question perhaps may
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
have been better addressed to the
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
previous speaker but let me ask you
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh schools especially charter schools
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
have finite capacities
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
so my question has to do with
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
the discretion that charter schools have
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of accepting
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
numbers or certain
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
students um can
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
students um can
can

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
public charter schools uh opt to just
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
not uh accept
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
certain special needs students or can
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
you speak to that thank you for the
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
question um you certainly could ask out
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the department as well but they are
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
public schools they are required to
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
look at all students who want to enroll
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
there and the iep team is required to
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
meet once the student enrolls there to
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
talk about how what accommodations and
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
modifications the student would need to
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
be able to participate
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.630 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
mullen

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question over there ms wilson
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
my question is about whether or not in
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
your review of mousse because i would
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
imagine your agency sees a fair number
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
are there ever provisions in the mou to
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate the effectiveness of the mou
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
typically are timelines built in to
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
review the mou
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that it's you know meeting
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
the needs of both parties i think that
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
is where we feel that the model from the
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
department would be helpful i think both
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
for local charter schools who are going
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
to have a number of districts and if
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
this were to pass in terms of trying to
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
negotiate these multiple mous
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
but again to your to your point i think
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
to representative moffett's point
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
different districts and different
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools have different resources
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
so what the specifics of what might need
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
to be contained in each mlu might be a
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
little bit different so it would be
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
important to review those on a regular
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
basis i think once you have a student
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the public charter school
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
who requires special education services
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
and you have an mou
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
it would make sense that you would
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
review it on a regular basis
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
but again that doesn't
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
change the fact that if you were to have
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
one student with special education needs
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
who enrolls in the local public charter
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
school and you develop an mou you're
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
reviewing that child's iep as an iep
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
team if another student from your
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
district enrolls in that same charter
 
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.069 align:start position:0%
district enrolls in that same charter
school

00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily doing a new mou
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
you already have that but you are having
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
another iep team meeting for that
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular student to talk about that
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
particular student's needs and how those
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
are going to be met in the public
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions of becky
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i have no further cards
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
for this bill so we will close this
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
hearing for 2 38
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
and move on to the next hearing which is
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
a sb 381
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is a bill establishing the office
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%

education
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
just as a note on your last bill i
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
served on a commission
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
that investigated
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of these agreements
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
between the school districts and the
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
very encouraging
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
to see how well
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
all these adults got together and worked
 
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.030 align:start position:0%
all these adults got together and worked
out

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
problems with transportation
 
00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:36.549 align:start position:0%
problems with transportation
and

00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
do we hire a teacher or do we share a
 
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.309 align:start position:0%
do we hire a teacher or do we share a
teacher

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
all that was very encouraging
 
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.870 align:start position:0%
all that was very encouraging
until

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
you people
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that said we're going to
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
change who's responsible
 
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
change who's responsible
for

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
what who's to who's bears the
 
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.349 align:start position:0%
what who's to who's bears the
responsibility

00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:02.230 align:start position:0%
responsibility
for

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
in this room we investigated that
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we heard from a lot of people
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
and we produced the four inch binder of
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and there wasn't a happy story
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the whole binder
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
so the binders at the office of
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
performance audit and oversight now
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
and they're developing a scope statement
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
for a performance audit of
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
how we're doing with special education
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that brings me to senate bill 381
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm senator john reagan from senate
 
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.829 align:start position:0%
and i'm senator john reagan from senate
district

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
17. and
 
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.829 align:start position:0%
17. and
i'm

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
quite happy to present
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3812. may i add one thing in
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
please senator for the committee this is
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
an early bill
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
this bill has to be out of this
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee this week
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
go ahead
okay

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes an office of the
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
the way is cleared to implement this
 
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
the way is cleared to implement this
office

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of discussion
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
about why
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
isn't advocating for special education
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
students but there are a lot of people
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.549 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
pages and pages of testimony
 
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.549 align:start position:0%
pages and pages of testimony
from

00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
very upset parents
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
of special education students
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
tells us that we had to go somewhere
 
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
tells us that we had to go somewhere
else

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
so what the study committee
 
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.589 align:start position:0%
so what the study committee
did

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.710 align:start position:0%
did
was

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
decided to ask for a performance audit
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
of special education because we couldn't
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
get answers
 
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
get answers
and

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
left this with the idea for the special
 
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
left this with the idea for the special
advocate

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
advocate
so

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.150 align:start position:0%
so
that's

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
as that
 
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.829 align:start position:0%
as that
previous

00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
um school board
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
fella said
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
what's the intent of the legislation so
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation is to
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
have somebody
 
00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
have somebody
fielding

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
fielding
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
that are presented and often defeated
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
by law firms in the state of new
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire that have made it their
 
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire that have made it their
business

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
to defeat the parents of the special
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
one pair of parents
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
have in
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
several years paid
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
over twenty three thousand dollars in
 
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
over twenty three thousand dollars in
tuition

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
and they drive their daughter an hour
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
each way
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
every day to get to a school that is
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was an expensive solution to the
 
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.030 align:start position:0%
that was an expensive solution to the
problem

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then we met a we listened to a lot
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
often in tears over what they had to say
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
about the treatment that they had
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
developing an iep
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
and having been
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
brow beaten
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
by a law firm
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
into and finally giving up
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty tough when
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have a pile of statutes federal and
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.349 align:start position:0%
we have a pile of statutes federal and
state

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that say you have to do something
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
you can't just abandon these children
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much how the system
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
works now
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
if they're too costly or too much
 
00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
if they're too costly or too much
trouble

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
or the parents aren't able
 
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.549 align:start position:0%
or the parents aren't able
to

00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
employ an attorney to come to the
 
00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:17.270 align:start position:0%
employ an attorney to come to the
meeting

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
just beaten down and they're not able to
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
help their children
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
but it's the law
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
we have to help their children
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i facetiously said at one point
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
why don't we just take these kids and
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
we'll just build another building out by
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
prison and we'll just put them in there
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then we won't have to worry about
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
them they'll be fed clothed they'll be
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
housed and this is where they'll spend
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives
 
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.030 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives
and

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
i had too many people said
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is the solution if you're not going
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
to help them you might as well put them
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere where they're safe and other
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
people can be safe from them because
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're gonna too often
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
turn to crime for a way to make a living
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
because we're not giving them the tools
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we all enjoy
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate what all the
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
well-meaning people in this business
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
but we've just got too many
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
lost children
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
the office of the advocate for special
 
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.510 align:start position:0%

thank you very much senator uh i have
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
one one question for you we've received
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
correspondence from
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate yes which
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
is a independent agency within
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh the department of administrative
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
services indicating that this bill
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
replicates duties
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's their responsibility that they
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
are performing do you see it the same
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
way no because we had no testimony that
 
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
anybody was assisted by the office of
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
the child advocate for special education
 
00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.190 align:start position:0%

and that was my answer to the former
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
who decided it would be a good idea to
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
take this office
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
and give the money to the office of the
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
child advocate and let them have the
 
00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:31.990 align:start position:0%
child advocate and let them have the
employees

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
and continue on
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%

senator reagan for bringing this forward
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
um you'd
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
towards the towards the conclusion of
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
your remarks you talked about um special
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
education students that had been
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
abandoned by their their district and
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's pretty strong statement i was
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could elaborate on
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
on that not getting into specific names
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
or specific districts but just in the in
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
the in the in your selection of the word
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.710 align:start position:0%
the in the in your selection of the word
abandoned

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
abandoned
 
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
abandoned
um

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
you give provide a little context for
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
that well but the context would be that
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
knowing their child has a problem
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
and then goes to the school and say
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
i understand their services for
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
special needs children
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then they then proceed
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
through the process that exists now
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
and in the end
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing available for their
 
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.349 align:start position:0%
there's nothing available for their
children

00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:42.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and uh and thanks i i certainly
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
recognize i mean i think a number of us
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
have been on school boards and and
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
recognized that um that yeah parents are
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
very um um you know connected and
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
engaged to advocate for their for their
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
children and that sometimes
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i don't have the binder
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
that has all the testimony
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative mullen cordelli and lead
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
were the other members of the study
 
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.069 align:start position:0%
were the other members of the study
committee

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
further questions for senator reagan
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative woodcock thank you
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
everyone cordelia good morning i think i
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
think my question uh
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
i read through this a couple of times
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to find
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
beyond the annual report and the annual
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
information in the metrics
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
what what is this person's actual power
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
the setup is that the advocate will
 
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.349 align:start position:0%
the setup is that the advocate will
collect

01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
all the information of everything that's
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and become the expert opinion
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay so they advocate what what is it
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
they can actually do to change something
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
i imagine
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i imagine we'll see reports coming out
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
of courtrooms
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
over what they're gonna have to do on
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
the children okay thank you thank you mr
 
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.470 align:start position:0%
the children okay thank you thank you mr
chairman

01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's an independent office
 
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.549 align:start position:0%
it's an independent office
much

01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
like the child advocate office
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
i do i have a follow-up thank you so
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh they will be paid that office will be
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
paid out of tax payer funds correct
 
01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:38.710 align:start position:0%
paid out of tax payer funds correct
correct

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
so do you see this predominantly
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
when a parent takes the school district
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
to court or do you see them acting
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
before that time with the school
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
district hopefully we'll learn where the
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
pitfalls are that don't allow
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
the special special needs children's to
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
receive services
 
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
receive services
so

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
a information gathering mission for the
 
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
a information gathering mission for the
advocate

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
for the question representative mullin
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
represented waltz thank you mr chair and
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
um in the actual
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
hiring process uh the bill indicates
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the governor and council would
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
appoint somebody to this position
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
and it references experiences and
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
qualifications that would make them
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the job
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate a little bit more on
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
what those experiences and
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications might look like
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to see that
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
idea and specification to the governor
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
and council
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to decide
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
where to find the best person for this
 
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.789 align:start position:0%
where to find the best person for this
job

01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%

01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
public education these are parents of
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%

things and we had he there's 10 regional
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
offices there were huge staffs that went
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
in you'd send a whole team of
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
investigators in to do this this was no
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
simple thing to determine
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
whether a school district was providing
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
the most an appropriate education to a
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
special ed child
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and it appears that this office is
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
set up to address
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
concerns of individual parents not just
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
looking for patterns in school districts
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
of not providing faith
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned as to how this could
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
possibly work and not just become a
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
place where every disgruntled parent in
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
the state goes and makes a complaint
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
whether the school district is at fault
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
or not and how this office at a budget
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
of five hundred thousand dollars could
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
possibly have the resources to deal with
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
the number of disgruntled parents in
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
i also serve on finance i know more than
 
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.069 align:start position:0%
i also serve on finance i know more than
that

01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%

thank you for this opportunity to meet
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we'll work together more
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
i was just confirmed to this position
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
last week so i'm brand new here i've
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
also brought with me emily lawrence from
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the office to help with answering
 
01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.069 align:start position:0%
the office to help with answering
questions

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
i do rely upon my full written testimony
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
as submitted but i will share some
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
highlighted points in the interest of
 
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
highlighted points in the interest of
time

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
as you know the office of the child
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
advocate is an independent agency
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
mandated to provide oversight to state
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
and state arranged services to children
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
and promote children's best interest
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
i am here today
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to senate bill
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
381 establishing an office of the
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education as
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
written but would support the concept in
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 would establish an
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
independent independent agency
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services to
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
house an advocate for special education
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
the bill replicates current obligations
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the office of the child advocate
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
we do recognize the need for this role
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
but believe there is a solution without
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
redundancy and extra cost
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
the child advocate already has
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over education and special
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
education with access to children's
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
educational records and other
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
information about children pursuant to
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
rsa 21v
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
well while i am only days into my role
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
as child advocate my understanding is
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the mandate over education is
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
relatively new
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
and that the office has not yet fully
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
mobilized to educate the public
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
including the legislature about our
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
expanded jurisdiction
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we also lack the level of expertise that
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 represents in a new
 
01:07:56.319 --> 01:08:01.109 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 represents in a new
agency

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
we know that parents struggle to obtain
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
needed special education services for
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
their children and we are grateful for
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
all those parents here today and to
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
every day advocate for their children as
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
well as senator regan and the bill's
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors for recognizing the needs
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
for many children and families
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
too often the very manifestation of a
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
child special education qualifying
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
disability that has not been properly
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
assessed or addressed is the cause for
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
behavior that pro that prompts out of
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
home placements or adjudication for
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
delinquency enhancing resources to
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
assist children to access special
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
education services is in the best
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
interest of children in their optimal
 
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
interest of children in their optimal
development

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
it is also in the state's interest to
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
reduce unnecessary spending on children
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
receiving expensive deep-ended services
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
such as institutional care because of
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
unmet educational needs
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the senate committee of cognizance we
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out the redundancy of
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and recommended senate bill
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
381 be amended to place the advocate for
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
special education in the independent
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate the primary
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
reason for this is the office's
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over special education
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
under rsa 21b
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we have not yet fully
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
engaged individuals regarding assistance
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
with special education concerns this
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
shortcoming is viewed as an effect of
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
limited staffing and pandemic related
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
obstacles for community outreach
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
we further note that in the senate
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
education committee hearing rebecca
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
fradette director of special education
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
testified that the bill is redundant to
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
some of the functions the doe is
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
required to perform per federal law
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
she explained that since she has been in
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
the role for only a short time she is
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
working to ensure that the system and
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
services are
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
are being more responsive to families
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
placing the special education advocate
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
in the office of the child advocate
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
would bring that expertise and extra
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
manpower to provide outreach to families
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
and effective advocacy specific to
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
special education when needed
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
many children with comp complex special
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
education needs have other needs served
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
by multiple systems such as
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
and juvenile justice or child protective
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
services to that end the office of the
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
child advocate is already working with
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
many of the same families that would
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
a special education advocate keeping all
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
advocates under one roof would situate
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the special education advocate with
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
in-house supports and expertise in those
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
other specialty areas
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
creating a whole new agency would be
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
confusing for families already
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
navigating a complicated system a single
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
access for assistance navigating systems
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
and advocating for children eases the
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
burden of already frustrated parents
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately keeping the office of the
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
keeping to one office the child advocate
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
would save the state considerable funds
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
as requested of the senate education
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee i provide a very basic
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
overhead cost of a new agency versus
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
enhancing the office of the child
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
advocate with extra staff
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
they represent a potential savings of
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
approximately three hundred and
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand dollars from the
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill's fiscal note of five hundred
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars this estimate does not
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
include cost and workload burden for the
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
who staff administer services for
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agencies
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing the need to follow the field
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
toward more prevention services to
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
manifest minimize child protection in
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice cases the office's
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction was expanded to all
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
children's services this expansion of
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
services is just over a year old
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is very timely that senate bill 381
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
was raised as a need for the specialized
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
resources recognized in the office of
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the child advocate
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i urge you to amend
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 and place the special
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
education advocate in the office of the
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate with an allocation of
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
funds for the position and one legal aid
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
to support the advocate thank you for
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very much i i do
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
have one question of a sort of follow-up
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
to your presentation
 
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.350 align:start position:0%
to your presentation
um

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
i received the email from you the other
 
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.790 align:start position:0%
i received the email from you the other
day

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
and in it it says we also lack the
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
resident expertise and special education
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
law that would be most helpful to
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
children with complex needs
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
so the letter itself stating that you
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area of special
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
education law then why is
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
why then are
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
is your organization then oppositional
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the direction of this bill
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
correct we do not which is why we
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
believe taking on the staff who have
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
that specialty to work alongside the
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
other advocates within the office would
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
be a better option as opposed to a
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
separate agency in itself
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%

hampshire thank you um i was wondering
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
and sort of follow on to uh what what um
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative ladd
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
was uh was inquiring um you would you'd
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
you you talk about the um the sort of
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
the multiple dimensions of of the the
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
certainly having to work with a number
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
of different uh parameters and um and
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of the i guess the the
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
specific needs of of different children
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the different support
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
channels that exist in the state would
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
would incorporate incorporating special
 
01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
would incorporate incorporating special
education

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
under the office of the child advocate
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
improve the um the outcomes not just for
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
um for special edu where there's where
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreements with respect
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
to special education but also perhaps
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
for other children too by having that
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
expertise some uh you know under one
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
roof yes we do believe so because
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
we do have the expertise in regards to
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
children with mental health difficulties
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
and behavioral health struggles so
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
incorporating the special education
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
which is often a crossover with where we
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
see a lot of behavioral needs having
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
that all in one house and sharing the
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
expertise with the person who will bring
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
expertise and special education would
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
optimize our ability to serve all
 
01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.110 align:start position:0%
optimize our ability to serve all
families

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
think about how this works
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell me
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
if a parent or well let's say if a child
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
needs an advocate
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
not meaning in working with our office
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's yeah whether i mean whether
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's the special whether it will be the
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
special needs advocate or whoever
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
an advocate that's assigned to the child
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
who pays for the
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
who pays who pays that
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
does the state does the parent who does
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
that so within our agency we have staff
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
that are paid through the state and
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
those staff
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
screen calls um handle complaints and
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they would be in in this case also
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
having the special education advocate
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
along with a legal aid would be able to
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
be the contact paid through the state
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the budget proposed
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and
 
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and
congratulations

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the new position
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire thank you um
 
01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:17.830 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire thank you um
uh

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering about your
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
approximately a year ago those mandate
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
um expansion for uh to include education
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
and and looking at the statute i i
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
really see that it looks like the
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
current responsibilities of the um
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
office are centered on
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
child welfare and juvenile justice
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a little confused about where the
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
education responsibility
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
with that expansion we were able to have
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of all agencies that serve as
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
children across the state which is which
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
would encompass education as well so we
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
have access to the records and the
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate with schools on
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of children
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative ellison
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
question just
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe some details from you on
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
how this person the advocate would
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
function going back to the previous
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
who are they responsible to
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
what is the outcome of let's say they
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
deal with a number of cases
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh they
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
whatever decide that this has happened
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
this has happened this has happened what
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
what effect is that of is of that
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
information where i'm actually asking
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
what is the impact of what this person
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
could actually do within the systems
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
sure much like the office of the child
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
advocate there within our office they
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
would fit in a similar role um with the
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
collect the data process the data work
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
on complaints with families and then
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
take this back to meetings with the
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
special education department meetings
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
with legislature about other legislation
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
that impact special special education
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
so they would have a very similar role
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
to mine now but specific to special
 
01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.430 align:start position:0%
to mine now but specific to special
education

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.189 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
porter

01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
porter
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome thank you
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused about the word
 
01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused about the word
advocate

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
in my mind if if i were a parent
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
and i had a child with learning
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities and i felt that they
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
weren't getting what they needed
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
and an advocate came to help me i would
 
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
and an advocate came to help me i would
think

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that advocate might be coming to
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
the iep meetings with me and helping me
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
understand the law and that sort of
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
thing but i'm getting the idea
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
from what i'm hearing now that that's
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
not what the office would do the office
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
would be more
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
checking into things and making reports
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that things could get fixed am i
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
right in my second
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
yes we would not have the resources to
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
have staff attending all iep meetings we
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to help educate parents on
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
rights and how to proceed and we would
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
also be able to point them in the
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
direction of other resources that
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
already exist within special education
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
that they may not be aware of that could
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
tanner

01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
question so does the advocate then
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
become an expert witness and or give the
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
parent uh legal
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
advice or information that they can then
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
bring to
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication of their concerns
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe um i don't believe so
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
because currently with under the child
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
advocate law it does not state that we
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
can be involved in any court involvement
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
um you know being an expert witness is
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
not included in the role so no
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
reps and
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
hall thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
before i gather the parent information
 
01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:15.189 align:start position:0%
before i gather the parent information
center

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
pick that the parents use do they pay
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
for that service do you know that the
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes do they have to pay when they want
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
an advocate and they go to the parent
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
information center is that something
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
they personally are responsible for
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
paying um or is it free something i'm
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
entirely clear on but i believe there is
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding for some of that so i
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
think some of it is covered
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i can get back to you with an answer
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
on that okay great thank you
 
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
on that okay great thank you
yeah

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to make sure people are
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
using the mic when they speak i'm sorry
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for being here
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
welcome aboard uh quickly um i i
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
certainly you you got my our attention
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned the 317 000 savings
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
but again this is a policy committee so
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
back to policy and i know you're new uh
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
but perhaps somebody uh i know
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative mullen rip some cordelia
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
rip some loud apparent and
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
senator reagan have already dealt with
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
this my question is are you aware of
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
success or not success
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
with this type of position in other
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
states are there models out there that
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with the specific
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
special education advocate utilized in
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
other states i am aware of other states
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
like our proposition here uh choosing to
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.830 align:start position:0%
like our proposition here uh choosing to
have

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
a specialist within the office of the
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
child advocate that assists with special
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
education needs
 
01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.790 align:start position:0%
education needs
uh

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
so what you just said then is the notion
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
of this position being rolled into
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
an existing position that model is out
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
there you in other states
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
is what i'm hearing yes
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
further question represent hobson
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome to new
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank you for taking my
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
question i was just wondering if i don't
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
know if i missed it um your letter was
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
pretty uh
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
information packed can you tell me do
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know how many positions you might be
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
looking to hire thank you
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes so we would be looking for two
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
positions one being the special
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
education advocate and the other being a
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
legal aid to assist with the advocates
 
01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
legal aid to assist with the advocates
role

01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
several times as we've talked about
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
we've gotten to this point where we've
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
been talking about someone
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
gathering information
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you heard just a little bit
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
before when people got a little
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
frustrated because they were looking for
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
an answer from the senator
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
and i suspect the same is from you but
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to confirm or deny that
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
what happens when you get to a point
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
where you're aware of something which
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
might even be illegal
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
what then do you do
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're not hearing
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
with this it's just sort of what we know
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
well we're more interested in what are
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
you going to do about it
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
or what are you authorized to do about
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
it if it's not anything i understand
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
we need to know that
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely so what we would look to do
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
with this role is we would look to
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
collect the data like i said follow the
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
trends put out reports on this so that
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
it is aware we'd look to have connection
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
meetings with the
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
special education department on a
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
consistent basis to talk about these
 
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
consistent basis to talk about these
issues

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about resolutions to these
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
issues we could make recommendations for
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
solutions once we have some data and
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
some reviews and then also bring things
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
to the legislative table if we feel that

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know advocate for change if we feel
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's not being addressed at special
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
education level we have the data then to
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
back what we would look to change in
 
01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
back what we would look to change in
legislature

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
further questions of the
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
office of
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%

thanks for taking um my question would
 
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.910 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking um my question would
um

01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
just sort of following on the you know
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
the conversation about about you know
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
folding this in underneath the office of
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
the child advocate given your existing
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh expanded authority would this need to
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
this being the ability to hire a special
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
education advocate and the legal support
 
01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
education advocate and the legal support
staff

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
staff
under

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
under the office of child advocate would
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
this need
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
new legislation
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
or could this be done through
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i believe
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
this could be done through the budget
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
process since we already have
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this area
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
it would be a matter of just folding in
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions i have one
 
01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.229 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions i have one
follow-up

01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh i've worked with this office before
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
individuals which are incarcerated in
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
one of the uh
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
institutions we have here within the
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
state up in grafton county
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh where a student was a person was
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
under age 21 had an active iep
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
and was not being served
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of though of regular education
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
does your office
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
have authority to access educational
 
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.629 align:start position:0%
have authority to access educational
records

01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:24:54.639 --> 01:24:55.750 align:start position:0%
records
of

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
any student
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
or do you have to be first contacted to
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
so under the statute it allows us to
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
access edu it says education records so
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
typically we wouldn't just access a
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
record unless someone contacts us but we
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily need to um
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
under the law we have that permission to
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
access i'm familiar with that area of
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
statute i was just curious to know how
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
that worked though in terms of
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
saying i want to go and look at this
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
file this student
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
can you do that without parental
 
01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
can you do that without parental
permission

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
sure the um we currently can with dcyf
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
records to be honest we have not
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to go
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
look at case records specifically at a
 
01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
look at case records specifically at a
school

01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it is our understanding that we
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to do so
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we do not have to seek permission
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
the same with gcyf
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%

01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
the same question that i asked senator
 
01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.229 align:start position:0%
the same question that i asked senator
reagan

01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
reagan
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
if you were to be hiring for this
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
position how would you go about or what
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
kind of criteria would you use to
 
01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.189 align:start position:0%
kind of criteria would you use to
determine

01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
who has uh appropriate experience and
 
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.310 align:start position:0%

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
we would be looking for somebody who has
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
a background in special education for a
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific length of time um but
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
especially if they have had the
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be on the advocacy end
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know whether previously enrolled as
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
an advocate or having actually done the
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
front line work of advocating so we
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
would be looking for that background and
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
we would also use the assistance of our
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
oversight commission in that hiring
 
01:26:42.159 --> 01:26:44.709 align:start position:0%
oversight commission in that hiring
process

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%

thank you for hearing me chairman and
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
esteem committee i just wanted to say a
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
few words this morning i'm here
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
representing families of new hampshire
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to keep this short as i
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
have to run to another meeting i'm one
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
of your typical special needs parents
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's trying to fit in everything for
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
my kids and to advocate for them
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
including being here today because not
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
that it affects them directly anymore i
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
think i shared with the committee last
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
time i was here three of them are now
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
out of school doing other alternative
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
school options
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
and you know i think there's a few
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
different arguments i want to cover one
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
is i think we want kids in school right
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree to that we want
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
kids in school being part of the system
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
getting the supports and services that
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
they need right
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the people of new hampshire spoke
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
really clearly on this bill
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
several months ago maybe even a year ago
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
700 people signed a petition
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
for this bill and felt it was that
 
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
for this bill and felt it was that
important

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i have to tell you having advocated
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
for families in the state now because of
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
my kids
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
that it's a very precarious position you
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
put yourself in when you stick your neck
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
out and you sign a petition like that
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
it comes with retaliation
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that might blow some people's minds but
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's the life that we live when our
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
kids are in special education in this
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
state we are regularly retaliated
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
against and we had people 700 people
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
sign this put their names to it so i
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
would multiply that many times over when
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
you're considering the amount of family
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
need for this
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
what i didn't hear with the last couple
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
speakers was going back to why we're
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
here we felt that an independent party
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
boy and those those that word really
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
rings and means a lot to me independent
 
01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
rings and means a lot to me independent
independence

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
independence
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
independent party was needed for this
 
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.470 align:start position:0%
independent party was needed for this
role

01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
why would that be well i heard
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
grow resources
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh work with special educators
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
redundancy jurisdiction lacking
 
01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.270 align:start position:0%
redundancy jurisdiction lacking
pandemic

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
where are families in all of this
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that really jumped out
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear anything about families
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
i am the voice the families and i sit
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
here and i imagine
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
a slew of you know army of parents
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
behind me when i come to speak because i
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
fit it in between the little time that i
 
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:04.870 align:start position:0%
fit it in between the little time that i
have

01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i hope that that carries a lot of
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
weight because i do feel it's important
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
to be here and to say we're leaving
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
families out of the equation we don't
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
need another pick we don't need another
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
disability rights center we've had these
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
solutions we've tried them they don't
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
work because 381 said that they didn't
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
work right so if we want kids in schools
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
then we need to look what services they
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
need in the eye and provide faith which
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
is according to federal law a free and
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate education we are not doing
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
that in the state today so to talk about
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
funding and we'd need more money and
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know gosh if we get a class action
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit all this goes out the window
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay texas had that happen
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'd hate to see that happen here but
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
that snowball has been building over
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
time and it will eventually happen if we
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't address this in the right way
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
so when i hear about
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
another agency or another
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
group that's going to grow itself the
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
first of all there's a lacking level of
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
expertise here that stood out to me you
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
know when you're talking about the
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate and i can tell
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
you this from firsthand experience i
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
came through a six-year marathon divorce
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the great state of new hampshire and
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
i paid for a guardian ad litem
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
i figured they would understand special
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
needs we're not talking anything too
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
rocket science here we're talking about
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
autism things like that do you know that
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the final report not any of the
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
plethora of evidence that i provided
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
from medical doctors in boston was taken
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
into any consideration
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
and that's that's just one experience of
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
many where this happens all the time
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about kids that need
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
residential or institutional care we're
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
talking about your average child that
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
now about 1 in 20 has neurodiversity and
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
neurodiverse needs the rigid school
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
settings aren't a good match for that so
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 30 minutes of speech
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
30 minutes of occupational therapy a
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
week you know something very basic
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i also heard this group isn't going
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
to be in iep meetings so if you're not
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
even going to be in iep meetings how are
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
you possibly going to understand what's
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
going on in these cases
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i share my own you know
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh situation with the gio because
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
obviously there wasn't enough bandwidth
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
for this person to even understand
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
how i broke down i made timelines i had
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
everything you name it they didn't take
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
the time to do any of that homework
 
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.669 align:start position:0%
the time to do any of that homework
so

01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know i think that there's a
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
danger here that we need to be very
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
careful of a mindful of that we're
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
already in a situation where
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
there is a risk of overreach
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
with people that are not trained so we
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
run into this today already in schools
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
with a school psychologist maybe who has
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
minimal minimal training trying to come
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
up with a diagnosis
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be diagnosing right
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're not medical professionals and
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
because of this bill
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
and actually the burden of proof we got
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of consideration along the
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
lines of the fact that these are not
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
medical professionals they should not be
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in kids
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i would say the same applies to an
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
office of the advocate how can they
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
possibly understand something that it
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
takes medical doctors years and years
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
and years to understand and go to school
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
for and
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know so there is a danger of
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
overreach there's a danger of the risk
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
of understanding the complexities
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
we already have protections for
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
districts i heard you know special
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
educators but i didn't hear families
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about now commingling
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
child's education records
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
you're allowing them access to things
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know and this growing bureaucracy
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
will very easily have a way i mentioned
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
retaliation the beginning
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
you bet retaliation can happen it just
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
now opens the door and makes it 10 times
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
more easy for that to happen
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
and these aren't kids that need you know
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about kids in the sununu
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
center kids with behavioral issues if
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
they have them it's because they have
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
underlying medical needs that weren't
 
01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
underlying medical needs that weren't
addressed

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
so you know budget aside you know
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
whoever does this aside we need to do
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
the right thing here for families listen
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
to the families that brought this up to
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't need more health and human
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
services folks and lawyers bottom line
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i appreciate your time
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
today do you have any questions thank
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
representatives

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
so ideally what would you like to see
 
01:33:24.719 --> 01:33:26.390 align:start position:0%
so ideally what would you like to see
created

01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
i could tell you it would be you know
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i did see this
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
solution come about as the bill evolved
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
and you know as i mentioned there my
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
hackles went up a little bit when i
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
heard about more another office right
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
i do think there can be merits to
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
something like that i think it's the way
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's approached i work in software
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
engineering i hire people all the time
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
that are very you know they're for very
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
specific needs and levels of experience
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i would say it it's dependent on you
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
know the success of that role and that
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
that position is dependent upon who you
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
get for that right it all comes down to
 
01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.510 align:start position:0%
get for that right it all comes down to
people

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i think you need to listen to
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
families and look at what are the set of
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
things that you know as we become
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
experts as parents even in our own kids
 
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
experts as parents even in our own kids
needs

01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
heck we're we're actually experts in a
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
lot of this too you know and i'm not
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting you hire a parent per se but
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
i would say we need to keep that
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
balanced with not just reaching into the
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
pool of the same old same old that we go
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
to but look at it a little bit
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
differently and maybe um
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
a little more radically even be a little
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
more progressive in our thinking about
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
who we'd want to hire for that
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the same old cookie cutter
 
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.950 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the same old cookie cutter
approach

01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you uh
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you and thank you for
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming today and just as kind of a
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative lakers's
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
idea you had mentioned something about
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
um that they need to be able to go to an
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
iep meeting and it seems like a lot of
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
the frustration is that parents don't
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
feel as though they have an equal
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
footing with
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the school district than the lawyers and
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
and just them
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and i think we've had other bills
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
that have come through that have tried
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
to balance that out a little bit
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and so unless you had a
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
office of like 500 people
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
that could go out uh you know or
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
deputize them to go out it just in my
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
mind i'm i'm trying to
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
from hearing you and
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know my heart goes out to you but
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
how how do you see this being
 
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.070 align:start position:0%
how how do you see this being
implemented

01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh on on the to help the the family you
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
know because you're advocating at that
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
level right well and i'm happy to follow
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
up with testimony and i'm going to send
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
everybody the copies of the petition
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
whatnot but i also put together a flow
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
chart at one point in time that
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
describes the process so i think there's
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
some points of failure in the process
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
and one that really bothers me in
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
particular is
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
and this will tie back to the number of
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
meetings so
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
it isn't humanly possible for someone to
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
go to all these meetings right no it's
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
just not going to happen but i do think
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
that someone should be seeing these
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
meetings because for someone like myself
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's in software engineering and
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
process re-engineering
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to see along the spectrum
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the key decisions that are made and
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
the points that decisions need to be
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
made where this gets dragged out
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and that's done a lot of
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
times on purpose
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
frankly and you have 10 meetings instead
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
of one meeting so i think that a
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
successful advocate could be involved
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
right up front in the process we also
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's a part of
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
vape or rather the idea process that
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
talks about that schools only need to
 
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.990 align:start position:0%
talks about that schools only need to
consider

01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
documentation on a medical diagnosis and
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
that to me is a real sticking point
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
because if i'm coming in with boston
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
children's hospital diagnosis of autism
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever and i've gone through
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to get this child
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed done my done my job as a
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
parent right jump through hoops then
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
that should be more than just considered
 
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.270 align:start position:0%
that should be more than just considered
right

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
but the wording of some of these things
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
is such that that allows the process
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
just keep going and keep going keep
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
going so there's inefficiencies in the
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
process itself and some of those
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately are tied to idea and
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
federal law and some things that we need
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
to change
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
but i do think that we should be
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
empowered as a state to make some of
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
those changes ourself and implement
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
differences in process where we can come
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
to agreement earlier on right and get
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
those 30 minutes of speech to that child
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
sooner like
 
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.709 align:start position:0%
sooner like
we're

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at the
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies of the whole thing it's
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
just we're spending exponential amounts
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
of money just arguing with each other
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
right and if we just did the right thing
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
up front
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
that would save all the rest of that so
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question no you can't be
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
in every iep meeting you can't even be
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
to every child's one iep meeting but i
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
think we need to make a better attempt
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
of really seeing what's happening and
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
actually you know i would invite all of
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
this committee go check out an iep
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
meeting sit in one sometime and and
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
you'll easily see where there's
 
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.310 align:start position:0%
you'll easily see where there's
inefficiency

01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
inefficiency
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers your question
 
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers your question
yes

01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
it it kind of does and kind of does
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i was a teacher for a long time so i
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
sat on a lot of iep meetings as as the
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
teacher and saw
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
what you see
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes um
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it seems like what you're asking for
 
01:38:14.239 --> 01:38:15.030 align:start position:0%
and it seems like what you're asking for
is

01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
different legislation to set a different
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know set of protocols and and the
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
way things are handled
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering how a five hundred
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
is going is going to do that i mean
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do that with with the
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the child advocacy group is
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
now trying to look into that with
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
what what areas they kind of specialize
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
in but it doesn't seem
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
to me that this particular bill hits
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
what you want it to and i'm just
 
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
what you want it to and i'm just
wondering

01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
if you see that as well
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a start in the right direction
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
families have no power right now pretty
 
01:38:54.719 --> 01:38:55.669 align:start position:0%
families have no power right now pretty
much

01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
and teachers i would say are in the same
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
boat okay so i recently ran for school
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
board in my town and that was one of the
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
messages that came really loud and clear
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
through to the teachers and i had them
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
many of them vote for me and it was
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
because they can't say anything
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're bound by and you would know that
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
sitting in those meetings they have to
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
toe the line to what administration
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
wants them to do they can't just speak
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
out and say you know what i think we
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
should just do this
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
um i think this is a start it is not
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know resolve all of the issues that
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
we have right now but if we do nothing
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
we fall back on
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
really lives being ruined and i can tell
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
you i testified in another committee and
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
quoted the old i'm not catholic but the
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
catholic church has a saying about if
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
you you know lay the foundation for a
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
child by the time they're eight
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
then that child is going to have a good
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
footing in life for their morals and
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
their ethics all that kind of stuff the
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
same is to be said here
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
we don't start to solve these problems
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to have entire generations
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
of dependent people on the state of new
 
01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
of dependent people on the state of new

hampshire
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
i can promise that
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to solve everything
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
overnight but it needs to be the right
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
independent office it needs to be the
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
right person or set of people
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i think you know as i tell my kids
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know you use your mind you use your
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
imagination the sky's the limit why
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
can't we do that here
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's a start it's better than nothing
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:40:19.679 --> 01:40:22.870 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
representatives

01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
could you um
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
send to us
 
01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
send to us
a

01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
list of the
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
failure points that you see commonly
 
01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.669 align:start position:0%
failure points that you see commonly
happening

01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
sure i'd be happy and your flow
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely thank you yeah it just
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
um as somebody in the professional world
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
of you know 20 plus years
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
it kind of boggled my mind and one of my
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
mom advocates is sitting behind me more
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
here so i got here because other parents
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
throw each other lifelines
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the process flow
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
finally at some point i said where i'm
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to sit down and put this process
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
flow together and pinpoint where we've
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
got problems because it blew my mind as
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
a professional sitting through these
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
meetings and one day actually somebody
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
said well we're going to have to have
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
another meeting i said aren't we in a
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
meeting or you know i mean if any of you
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
have professional work lives you would
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate this right it's like the visa
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
commercial the cost of whatever and then
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
they get to the end of it says priceless
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of just getting this done is
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
priceless and it's not just priceless
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
because of the price tag it's because
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's a little face
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be helping or not
 
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be helping or not
helping

01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
helping
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
so i'll send you the flow chart i'm
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
happy to share it with anybody i wish i
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%

01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
was my message with the school board and

my name is christine metzner and i live
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
in ryan new hampshire i'm here to
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
support sb 381
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
and my experience with my son's 504
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
plans and in the iep process
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the need i believe for a
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
special education advocate here in new
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have this three inch binder
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's overflowing with emails letters
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
plans notices meeting notes
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
are corrections to meeting notes
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
doctor's letters
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
updated doctor's letters and it just
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
covers 14 months
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i think as i go through this it might
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the failure points in
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
these processes
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
when my son was 10 he developed a
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
neuroimmune condition and among his many
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
symptoms were extreme anxiety
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
agoraphobia sensory issues and cognitive
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
regressions as if it was as if he had a
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury but his symptoms
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
when he was in sixth grade we developed
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
a 504 plan and later wound up in the iep
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
process now i'm a lawyer by training i'm
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
not presently practicing and i
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
familiarize myself with these laws and
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
especially for the iep process it took
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
hours to begin to understand the
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
framework of the system i was
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and i turned to an advocate
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
and later a lawyer for help
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
i made it clear to the school what i
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
believed would help my son
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
some home tutoring because his
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
agoraphobia was so bad he could not
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
leave the house
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
we had meetings multiple meetings that
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
my son's psychologist attended but they
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't say yes or no in my request
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
i finally resorted to hiring a lawyer
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
which made the school start having a
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer attend the meetings but once i
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
hired a lawyer my simple request for a
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
home tutor a couple hours a week was
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
magically granted
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
this was four weeks and three meetings
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
the tutors came to our house for about
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
two months until the end of the school
 
01:44:41.199 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
two months until the end of the school
year

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
my son probably had about 20 hours of
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
two-day tutoring
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that was all of his public education
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
for the last six months of his sixth
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
grade year i'm sure they'll and
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
you can tell the lawyers made more money
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
than the tutors not to mention the hours
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
of administrator and teacher times
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
come september the school would not
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
allow further tutoring
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
by my request recommendations from my
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
son's providers his doctors his
 
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.950 align:start position:0%
son's providers his doctors his
psychologists

01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
he was starting to do better could leave
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
the house uh was also very fatigued so
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
he was on a very part-time schedule
 
01:45:24.239 --> 01:45:25.669 align:start position:0%
he was on a very part-time schedule
and

01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
they just would not agree to tutoring
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
until we finished the iep valuation
 
01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.709 align:start position:0%
until we finished the iep valuation
process

01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:45:32.719 --> 01:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
process
so

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
when we signed the consent to the
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
evaluations 60 days passed
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
no word from the evaluators
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we agreed the school asked for an
 
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
so we agreed the school asked for an
extension

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
30 days later still no completed
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
evaluations i never heard from one of
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
the school's evaluators and the school's
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
chosen psychiatrist
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
never contacted my son's providers for
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
the information he needed
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
at this point there'd be been a total of
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
nine 504 in iep meetings my son's
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
psychologist was at six of these
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
meetings and my lawyer and the school's
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers were at five of
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
them meanwhile my school was getting two
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
we finally decided to homeschool our son
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
he was not getting free in appropriate
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
education and although the school didn't
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily abandon him
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
the school was kicking the can down the
 
01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:30.629 align:start position:0%
the school was kicking the can down the
road

01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
while i was homeschooling my son i was
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
shocked by how many people are
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
homeschooling their children because of
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
the difficulties they face in bible
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
chores or ieps there's not even
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
statistics on that nobody keeps that in
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
parents of children who need
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
accommodations or services need an
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
office to turn to for help
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
i mentioned earlier that i'm a lawyer by
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
training the procedural safeguards
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
aren't written in plain english and i
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
had trouble understanding that i hired
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
an advocate then a lawyer
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
and if i needed him
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
imagine a single mother with a full-time
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
job and children with significant
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
educational needs or someone for whom
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
english is not a first language
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know schools are spending more and
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
more on legal fees my own siu has talked
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
about increasing legal expenses
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
in their budget because they see a trend
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
of advocate outreach by parents i'm not
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure what else parents are supposed to
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
do the trade schools get so much
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
training from law firms
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason for them to hire a
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer for individual 504s and ieps
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
i've seen no indication that schools are
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
asking why parents are seeking more help
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
parents don't fully understand the
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
process they don't feel heard and are
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
quite likely up
 
01:47:44.719 --> 01:47:48.149 align:start position:0%
quite likely up
overwhelmed

01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to address the uh
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
position of the office of the child
 
01:47:53.679 --> 01:47:54.950 align:start position:0%
position of the office of the child
advocate

01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
one thing i
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
think about here often is that the
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate as i
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
understand it was too created to provide
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
assistance for children
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
in cases of abuse or neglect or in the
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system primarily
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't there might be some overlap
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
with special education
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
i would be shocked
 
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.830 align:start position:0%
i would be shocked
if

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there's a majority of
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
children who need special education and
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
the office of
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
the special education advocate who also
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
have children in the dcyf system and in
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
fact i actually sort of see that as a
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest i don't know how
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
would address those situations and um
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
especially the office of the child
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
advocate is for
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:50.149 align:start position:0%
advocate is for
people

01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
parents families who are trying
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing for their children
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to say that my son is now
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
quite a bit better he's improved
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
substantially he's returned to public
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
school and he's now thriving as a
 
01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.750 align:start position:0%
school and he's now thriving as a
sophomore

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
sophomore
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions and i do have
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
my written testimony thank you very much
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.870 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
morning for the record my name is jane
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
bertrand and i am the executive director
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire association of
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
administrators and i will um keep my
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
comments uh brief my written testimony
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
is going around you'll see from our
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that we we do recognize the
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
importance of this kind of an office but
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
would respectively raise several
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns the first point
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we want to bring forward is that
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of ed
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently has a process
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
for investigating special education
 
01:50:16.239 --> 01:50:17.510 align:start position:0%
for investigating special education
complaints

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.310 align:start position:0%
complaints
and

01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
currently there really is no real
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that this process
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
um is not being provided and that the
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
department is failing to do their job in
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
terms of investigations and i'm sure the
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
department can give you specifics on the
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers of complaints that come
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
how they are reviewed and dealt with
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
point that we want to bring forward is
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
that idea
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
makes each state agency responsible for
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
the oversight
 
01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:51.030 align:start position:0%
the oversight
of

01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
services to kids with disabilities
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't see that there's a need to
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
have a duplicate office for that and and
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
feel that new hampshire
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
is sufficiently meeting those needs in
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the oversight of services
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
provided to students with disabilities
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
we also want to point out that currently
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the bureau of special education is
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
understaffed there's only one position
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
within the bureau that's state funded
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
the rest of the positions our
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
and would raise the question as to
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not those resources that are
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
in this bill whether or not they should
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
be dedicated and directed towards the
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
bureau of special education to enhance
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
their current processes and procedures
 
01:51:35.679 --> 01:51:36.550 align:start position:0%
their current processes and procedures
um

01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
we also brought forward several other
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
questions within the testimony in
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
regards to some of the specific language
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
and some of that has already been
 
01:51:44.639 --> 01:51:46.149 align:start position:0%
and some of that has already been
mentioned

01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
in closing we would say that you know in
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
general we feel as though this bill just
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
recreates a duplicate system for one
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
that alway already exists in new
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i would uh open it up for
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.709 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing conflicting things here you
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
said everything is being handled the
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
people are all doing what they're
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to and yet we have lots of
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
parents coming in saying it's not being
 
01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.870 align:start position:0%
parents coming in saying it's not being
handled

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
handled
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense as to
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
why this dichotomy
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i think
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good one and i would suggest
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we really dig deeper at the data
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the number of disgruntled parents
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
versus those who are satisfied and
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
really looking at what some of the
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
critical issues are
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that the vast majority of
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
parents in the state are satisfied
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh if there are it's you know
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
areas in which we need to improve we're
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainly open to doing that
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
and would would really suggest that we
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
dig a little bit deeper at the data we
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
heard this morning about the large
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
binder of of complaints and would really
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
say you know how many
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
parents are those and and no parent
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
should ever be
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
disgruntled and no child should ever not
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
get their services and we're willing to
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
deal with that
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
but to bring forward legislation on
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
small numbers
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
we may want to look more closely at that
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
so thanks very much mr chair thanks very
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
much jane for taking my question just a
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
real quick one just so we can put this
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
in context
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
approximately how many special children
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
are um
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services in
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i think becky could really
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
give us the specifics but i think it's
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
around 17 of the our student population
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so that would be around the 30 to
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
35 000. i believe it's that's right
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
around that number thank you
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers which we have
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's usually hovering right around 30
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
plus thousand of students dollars
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay further questions did you have your
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and thank
 
01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and thank
you

01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.589 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking the same thing
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
actually when we're hearing that there's
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
a petition of at least 700 people that
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
sounds significant um but i i suppose
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
putting in perspective with 30 to 35 000
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
i can see both sides i'm just curious if
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
anyone has taken
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
or had the chance to dig into the data
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
to see if maybe there are certain
 
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.070 align:start position:0%
to see if maybe there are certain
districts

01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
that we're running into issues with more
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
so than others and maybe that needs to
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
be addressed versus legislation
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
and again i think that would be
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
something the department of education
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
could uh answer there they they're the
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
ones that deal with uh complaints
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
and could probably give you more
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much thank you
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
and committee members
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
my name is maura ryan and i'm a parent
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
advocate and a parent of a child
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
currently in school who has special
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
needs who has autism
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
um i want to sort of answer some of the
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions 700 people on a petition is
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
significant because of the incredible
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
retaliation that parents get when they
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the school district
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to address that ocr can
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
only take a complaint for 180 days which
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
passes in the blink of an eye and a due
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
process hearing only goes back two years
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is even less than what we allow
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
for our court procedures which is a
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
minimum of three years
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to add
 
01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.310 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to add
that

01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
we had a parent survey done by the
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
department of education which indicated
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
a lack of satisfaction with special
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
education services and it's well known
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
nationally that special education
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
services are not on par with where they
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
in our particular state over 97 percent
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the students who are in the iep pool
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
have normal range iqs
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
less than three percent have um
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
developmental and intellectual disabil
 
01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.390 align:start position:0%
developmental and intellectual disabil
disabilities

01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.350 align:start position:0%
disabilities
um

01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
so they should be capable
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
of maintaining
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
proper academic records and be
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
employable however that's not the case
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
and that gets shown in the proficiency
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
scores which are in single digits right
 
01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.390 align:start position:0%
scores which are in single digits right
now

01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
for right now students with ieps are
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
less than 10 for both reading and math
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
as for the parent information center the
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
parent information center can provide
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
free consultations to parents to talk
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
about some of the issues that they're
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
facing but they don't attend iep
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
meetings and they don't get involved in
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
due process they do have an advocate on
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
staff who will charge a parent 30 an
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
hour to go in and they will do a file
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
record review a file record review is
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
where they read the review and they make
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations and what happens is the
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
parent goes into the meeting
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
lists the recommendations and the school
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
says oh well we don't really have to do
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
that which is very frustrating to the
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
parent because they've just spent 30
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
dollars times 20 hours for a file review
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
which seems like it's not it's a
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
significant chunk of money for a parent
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
particularly who doesn't have those
 
01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:27.350 align:start position:0%
particularly who doesn't have those
resources

01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's been nationally recognized that
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
special education has been
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
a challenge for our country there are
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
other countries that are doing far
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
better my son is now 18 my cousin has a
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
kid who's five years younger than my son
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
who already speaks five languages and is
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
more proficient in academics because she
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
lives in our home country
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
and her and their education system is
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
better geared towards dealing with
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
we need this person i support sb 381 we
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
need this person to be an independent
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
special education literate person
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
special education is a very very
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
specialized field i know a lot of about
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
special education because i've been
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
breathing it 24 7 365 for 18 years
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's a long time i mean i had to get
 
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
up at five o'clock in the morning i
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
drive my son between three different
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
schools he has 12 different doctors all
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
of whom i manage so it's overwhelming
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
enough for me to deal with the basic
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
aspects of his care in addition to which
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
i have to become a special education
 
01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:28.310 align:start position:0%
i have to become a special education
expert

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
expert
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's important to note also
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
that special education complaints on the
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
federal idea part b increased 500
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
percent last year 500 percent
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
um many parents came and spoke out about
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
the problems that they were having in
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
the 581 committee and it's very
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to come and try and
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
come up here find parking
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
come up and you know many parents work
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
because they have to pay for therapies i
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
know that in particular i've paid for
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
organ gillingham for my son for at least
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
seven years to a total probably about
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
um which is something he should be
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
getting at school that is what he's
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
um my son attends school in manchester
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
and there's a colleague of mine luis
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
maldonado who posted on facebook why is
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
it that i have to have a lawyer involved
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
in every aspect of my child's special
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
education process
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
when does it end
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
and the the truth is it never ends it
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
never ends
 
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.229 align:start position:0%
never ends
um

01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
shannon bouchard was someone who i was
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
trying to help and she wrote to several
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
of you because she contacted the office
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate and she got a
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
blow-off email in response and was told
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
to write to a general email and she
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
never got help her kid's been out of
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
there are people who have written entire
 
01:59:48.639 --> 01:59:49.669 align:start position:0%
there are people who have written entire
thesis

01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
thesis
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
on how school districts can
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
cheat certain parents single mothers
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
people of color
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
low-income families military families
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
cheat them out of their kids special
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
education needs and the end result is
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
that almost the
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
almost 20 percent population of kids who
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
are on ieps are coming out
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
not capable of holding employment and
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
not fully educated because schools
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
follow the de minimis standard which is
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
basically the very very basic bare
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
minimum so you have 20 members of this
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
committee if you that would mean that
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
almost four of you would be un incapable
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
of functioning on this committee
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
incapable of living by yourself and
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
incapable of being fully functionally
 
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
incapable of being fully functionally
literate

02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
there are certain disabilities that have
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
not been dealt with effectively because
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
their newer autism in particular is one
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
rebecca ferdet said the increase in
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
cases of autism in our state have
 
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.030 align:start position:0%
cases of autism in our state have
increased

02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
666 percent and yet school districts
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
still do not know how to deal with
 
02:00:57.199 --> 02:00:58.149 align:start position:0%
still do not know how to deal with
autism

02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
autism
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
medical science is advancing faster than
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
educational policy is and they're
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
becoming better at adapting kids to
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
their environments than school systems
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
are and the problem is that medical
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
science is getting completely
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
disregarded by the educational school
 
02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.229 align:start position:0%
disregarded by the educational school
system

02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think the five hundred thousand
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
dollars to establish this independent
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
office is a drop in the bucket compared
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
to the millions that will be spent
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the almost 20 percent of the
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
population that will not pay taxes and
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
will not be able to be functional my son
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
right now got a 28 on his a.c.t has a
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
genius level iq and he is not able to
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
function academically in school has no
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
future in college and cannot hold a job
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
so my
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
ask is that you support this bill
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
because we the parents want an
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
we feel that this is necessary because
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
the system is not working and the proof
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
is in the proficiency scores and the
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
proof is in what parents write to you
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
and the proof is in all these pages
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
where parents are saying where is the
 
02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.910 align:start position:0%
where parents are saying where is the
help

02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
our kids are not getting their education
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:18.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%

go ahead thank you um
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
different uh people uh about the special
 
02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:55.830 align:start position:0%

doe
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the process some are saying there is
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
a process there is a
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
there is a step process for you folks
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
down there to take uh parents concerned
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
issues non-compliance in their opinion
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
and follow the way up and adjudicate
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
that some way and then we're hearing
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's not so can you just tell us in a
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
very brief format yeah we're required by
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
idea to have a dispute resolution
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
process and we do have one um it
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
includes complaints and it includes due
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
process hearings as well as mediation we
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
also provide iep facilitation to
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
districts and i do have numbers on
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
complaints and due process if you wanted
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
yep um so the the fault that then so if
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
i am a parent
 
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.790 align:start position:0%
i am a parent
uh

02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we heard this morning if they'd
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
gone if they go through your process at
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
a doe yep uh somewhere something is
 
02:03:44.639 --> 02:03:45.830 align:start position:0%
a doe yep uh somewhere something is
resolved

02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
typically yes yes if they go through one
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
one of those processes there is a res
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
there was a always either a it's
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
dismissed or a resolution to
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%

02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
the department looks at uh looks at
 
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.109 align:start position:0%
the department looks at uh looks at
complaints

02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
do um do you look to spot trends that
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
might um might exist yes we do so um i
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
work closely with natasha lupiani who is
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
the complete person and we will uh we
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
will discuss whether there are trends of
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
certain districts or if there are
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
certain things certain types of
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
complaints that we're getting so that we
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
can address those complaints either
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
globally to all of the special education
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
directors or targeted to a specific
 
02:04:32.079 --> 02:04:33.189 align:start position:0%
directors or targeted to a specific
district

02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
we do have a very small number of
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
complaints each year so it's it's hard
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
to find a trend with only 34 complaints
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
each year
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes you may and so so so based on
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
spotting trends and based on the um the
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
corrective action uh recommendations
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
that you that you that you make
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
have um has has that uh in in i guess
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
the cases where you've been concerned um
 
02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.350 align:start position:0%
the cases where you've been concerned um
uh

02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
addressed those those trends and and and
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
brought the numbers say
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know more um you know to what you
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
would expect
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
so our numbers for complaints and due
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
process are pretty consistent from year
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
to year even even over last year with
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we still are right around
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
the same number of complaints each year
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we haven't seen a drop or an increase
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
in those complaints
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so how many what's
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
your consistent number of complaints you
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
so so this year we have 34 complaints
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to pull it up because i
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
have it on my screen i apologize
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
so this year we had 34 complaints for
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21. um nine of them were
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
withdrawn or dismissed 25 of them did
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a decision and of those 25 15 of
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
them were found findings of
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so that would be where
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the district was found to be
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
represent tanner did you have your hand
 
02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.350 align:start position:0%
represent tanner did you have your hand
up

02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
basically i wanted the statistics like
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative porter um what happens
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
when the when the school is found in
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
non-compliant is that corrected yep so
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're given when they are found
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliant compliant they're given a
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
letter of correction that is developed
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
with natasha um diana fenton and the
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner and a decision is made as
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
to how they will correct that and if
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
there is anything else that needs to be
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
done um regarding that complaint and
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
just does it follow up
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of satisfaction survey
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
that or survey like exit
 
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.069 align:start position:0%
that or survey like exit
survey

02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
survey
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
from the parents to say how they felt
 
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
from the parents to say how they felt
the

02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the whole thing was
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
handled no there isn't currently thank
 
02:06:36.079 --> 02:06:37.030 align:start position:0%
handled no there isn't currently thank
you

02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that we had a survey
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
provided the group that was looking at
 
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.709 align:start position:0%
provided the group that was looking at
this

02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
um from the department uh could you
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of that survey to all
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
members of this committee um are you
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
referencing the 603 british future
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
survey survey that has the indicator
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
eight portions of it
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's that must be it you know i haven't
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
i have a copy but i don't know indicator
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
it is our family engagement portion and
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
we include it in the 603 bright future
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
service yes yes that's it yep i can give
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
you i can send those um those numbers to
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
you yes okay and the last question i
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
have for you and maybe it's best
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
directed towards the senator but um
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
we have a performance audit going on at
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
this point in time uh
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea where we are on
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
that are we nearing
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
wow we're at the top side of it
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department yes
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
represent lekkas
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
does the department do something to make
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
sure that all special needs students
 
02:07:44.239 --> 02:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
sure that all special needs students
know

02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
of what you can do what you provide etc
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
because it seems they're like there's
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
much bigger than 34.
 
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.069 align:start position:0%
much bigger than 34.
with

02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know a large number of parents who
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
were unhappy
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
but you're only seeing a small number of
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
cases and i'm wondering
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
where that breakdown is and why you have
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
parents who aren't being helped
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
but you're not seeing them
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
so um currently we
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
we require that the districts provide
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
pros excuse me procedural safeguards to
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
each parent which offers them all of
 
02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
each parent which offers them all of
those

02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines all of those for them
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
but after the hearings this summer and
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
then the senate hearing earlier we have
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
been in the process of developing parent
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
trainings that we're going to be
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
providing about how to do different
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
processes within um the department so
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
that is something that's on our radar
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of developing
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mullen
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i almost
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
almost missed my opportunity
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you ms verdet for taking my
 
02:08:49.679 --> 02:08:52.229 align:start position:0%
thank you ms verdet for taking my
question

02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
in fielding the
 
02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
in fielding the
complaints

02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not complaints generally
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
center around
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
parents wanting more than school
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
districts are offering and if so
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
how would a school district determine
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
where that line was
 
02:09:17.119 --> 02:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
where that line was
so

02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the our complaints are kind of um
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
widely varying there's no there's no
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
like i had said there's such a small
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
portion that to find trends um we do we
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
did find trends during the pandemic of
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
lots of complaints or calls around
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
masking and things like that and then
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
you may find complaints about whether
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
services were provided during the
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic but typically it's kind of a it
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
depends on where the student is who the
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
student is who the parent is it's not a
 
02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
student is who the parent is it's not a
consistent

02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
with such a small number there's no
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
consistent pattern that we see that that
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
we could pull from to to try to get some
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
of that addressed
 
02:09:53.199 --> 02:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
of that addressed
unfortunately

02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just the second part
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
of my question then without the first
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
part how do districts
 
02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:04.950 align:start position:0%
part how do districts
determine

02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
determine
that

02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
one child is going to get 10 hours of
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
reading and or math assistance and
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
another one
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
is only going to get four sure so each
 
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
student has to have a um annual
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation by
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
three year evaluation and so within that
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation they should be
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing what the students areas of
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
need are and what their strengths are
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
and then from there they would determine
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
the services
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
once you've determined those services
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
from that evaluation each year they're
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
quarterly or
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
trimester progress reports to tell how
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the student is doing and progressing on
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
those skills that you've targeted that
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
were identified in the evaluation so
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
through those three years you target
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
those skills you work on those skills
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
and provide progress reports so it's
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
pretty scripted about how you become
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
eligible um what your what the
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements are and then
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
once you've done all of those
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
evaluations you should be using your
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
evaluations to determine services and
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
what the child needs to address their
 
02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
what the child needs to address their
needs

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
further questions representatives
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a technical question as
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
both i experienced with my granddaughter
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
but i also have heard lots of other
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
parents say the same thing is that
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
a child has specific needs
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
they get an iep
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're being provided those needs they
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
do better
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
and because they're now doing above a
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
certain performance in school it's
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
determined that they
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't need an iep and don't need those
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
needs but it was those special things
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
they were getting that allowed them to
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
do better how does that all work so the
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
team should be discussing that and
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
should be saying will this student
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be successful if we take
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
away those supports or does the child
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
need to be and have those supports to be
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
successful we would hope that those
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
teams would be having that discussion
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
and would be looking at that there are
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
some students who if you took them away
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
they've made enough gains they've kind
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
of closed those gaps that you could take
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
the services away there are other
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
students that you really need to look at
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
that and say they still would not be
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
successful if we took those services
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
away so that should be a discussion that
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
each iep team is
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
having when they meet on the student
 
02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:21.740 align:start position:0%
would would um
 
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:23.430 align:start position:0%
would would um
[Music]

02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
would that be something that a parent
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
could come to you if the school decided
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
one thing and they were seeing something
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
different so natasha um loop as i said
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
lupiani takes all the complaints but she
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
also answers just because i don't have
 
02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.189 align:start position:0%
also answers just because i don't have
time

02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
um she also answers a lot of parent
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
questions so she will um walk parents
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
through the process she will talk to you
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
about the different options you have
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
she may she'll provide you to some
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
resources that might be available she's
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
only one person and but she does you
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
know she does answer that if it's
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
something that she's unclear of
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes she'll pass it on to another
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
member of my team so we may pass it on
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
to somebody who has more experience in
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
an area than she does or she consults
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
with us repeatedly to try to get that
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
answer correct to make sure that we're
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
providing information to the parent
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
has anyone ever been prosecuted for
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
denial of services to a child
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
there have been due process hearings
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
where children were not receiving
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
services and and the district was
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
ordered to
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
provide the services or provide
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
compensatory services yes
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further questions thank
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
and this will close the hearing on 381
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
we are going to take a five minute break
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
for everybody to stand up stretch
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back and start this
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
upright again in about five minutes with
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
who knows 3.94 happened together
 
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.750 align:start position:0%
who knows 3.94 happened together
that

02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay we're about ready to get going here
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're ready to open up this
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%

house education commission
 
02:22:36.399 --> 02:22:38.870 align:start position:0%
house education commission
committee

02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm jay kahn
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
from keene
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
state senator for 15 of 23 towns in
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to present senate bill
 
02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:52.630 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to present senate bill
394

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
394
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
which deals with our definition of a
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
child with disabilities under special
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
education law
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that is
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
394 is very similar to a house bill that
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
you considered earlier in the year house
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill 1513
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
which we have in the senate education
 
02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
which we have in the senate education
committee

02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and are considering
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing on that bill this last
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the wording between the two bills is
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
almost identical
 
02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
almost identical
so

02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
so
where

02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
house education ended up and where
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
senate education ended up is is very
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
much in the same place so let me explain
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
that place
 
02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
that place
we

02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
currently have special education
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 3
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
and 21.
 
02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that services
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
cut off at 21 years
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
when this has been debated in the
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
legislature over the past few years and
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you probably recall this a
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the testimony around it was
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
parents wanting
 
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
their student
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to complete a school year
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
once they reached 21.
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that when there wasn't a cliff
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
that in fact an iep
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh individualized education plan for a
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
student when they reached 21 wouldn't
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
just end on their 21st birthday but in
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
fact that student could continue to the
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what you did in house bill
 
02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
and that's what you did in house bill
1513

02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
1513
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did in the senate in
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 394 which is before you today
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh is explain
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
that change that has a fairly minimal
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
02:25:15.359 --> 02:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
on

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
our schools public schools in the state
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is because
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
most of the school districts in the
 
02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:25.910 align:start position:0%
most of the school districts in the
state

02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
are already doing that
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
is going through that kind of service
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh of
uh

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
the idea
221

02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
221
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
whenever the handoff is to developmental
 
02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
whenever the handoff is to developmental
services

02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
state developmental services
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
the goal is that a student
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
to ensure equality of opportunity
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
full participation independent living
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
and economic self-sufficiency for
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities so that's
 
02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:13.429 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities so that's
why

02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's important to complete the plan
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
and to provide
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
as much of a
 
02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:20.550 align:start position:0%
as much of a
transition

02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
transition
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
to those
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
goals which are the idea goals
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:26:26.479 --> 02:26:28.150 align:start position:0%
all right
so

02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.389 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's the good part i think
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's the easy part for us
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
the more difficult part that you're
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to hear that i've been hearing uh
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
in through our
 
02:26:41.359 --> 02:26:42.710 align:start position:0%
in through our
senate

02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.830 align:start position:0%
senate
hearings

02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
have gone to
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
let me let me lay out the landscape in
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
this in the nation there are eight other
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
states that were at the beginning of
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
this year at the same place that new
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
2 21.
 
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
there are 13 other states
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
that have language that we are intending
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
221 through the school year in which
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
but there is a recent
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
decision in rhode island
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
versus kl and it was decided in the
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal district court
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
that they needed to provide services
 
02:27:37.439 --> 02:27:38.230 align:start position:0%
that they needed to provide services
through

02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.510 align:start position:0%
through
21

02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
21
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
through 21.
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that we don't know i i
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't maybe somebody can put numbers on
 
02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.990 align:start position:0%
don't maybe somebody can put numbers on
it

02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
but it's not only what the cost is in
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
total it's how would it be parsed out
 
02:27:54.319 --> 02:27:56.630 align:start position:0%
total it's how would it be parsed out
right

02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
so here are some of the guiding statutes
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we need to try to bring into this
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
one is
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh 189 1 which is uh
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
what we are amending here which says
 
02:28:09.359 --> 02:28:10.830 align:start position:0%
what we are amending here which says
that

02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh we i'm sorry
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
186 c2 is what we're amending that's the
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
definition of a child with disabilities
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
in 189 1a
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
we described that our duty to provide
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
public education
 
02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
public education
is

02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
until a student has acquired a high
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
school diploma or has reached age 21.
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
age 21.
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the other states that
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
have gone through this litigation
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
but our our requirement is consistent
 
02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:52.230 align:start position:0%
but our our requirement is consistent
right

02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
school age is 2
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
age 21.
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
special education age is
 
02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
special education age is
221.

02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
221.
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
so at the current time we're consistent
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
but the courts have
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
said that
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you provide other educational
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
services like adult education
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
you need to go through 21
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
which is the federal definition if you
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't have state let
 
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.469 align:start position:0%
don't have state let
language

02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
if i've complicated this enough
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
good because it's
 
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
good because it's
it

02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
it it got more complicated through this
 
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
it it got more complicated through this
session

02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think as we learn more about the court
 
02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:36.230 align:start position:0%
i think as we learn more about the court
decisions

02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
and so the question is how do what do we
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
do next
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
i think the fact that two education
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
committees studying this question
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
arrived at the same place
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
is a good starting point we need to get
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
to through the school year when a
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
student turns 21
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
but we can't miss
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
the question that the department of
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
education is raising
 
02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
education is raising
about

02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
how do we prepare ourselves
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the fact that we're likely going to
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
wind up
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
at through 21
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
at some point down the road
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to do mr chairman is uh
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
work with you
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe somebody else who was
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
your decision
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh here
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
to propose a alongside
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
the through the school year as we have
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
it in this bill an amendment that would
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
bring it to
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
a study
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
commission that we create a study
 
02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:46.389 align:start position:0%
commission that we create a study
commission

02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
alongside this bill
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
involve stakeholders and determine how
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
we need to modify 186 c18
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is how we reimburse special
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
education services
 
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.230 align:start position:0%
education services
because

02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
these are not going to be simple
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
for students who have not completed a
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
high school diploma at age 21.
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
these will be more complex
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
these will reach
 
02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:22.790 align:start position:0%
these will reach
the

02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
thresholds that we've got in special
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
so school districts
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
are not going to cover the costs with
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars of additional
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
adequate education aid
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
they're likely going to be covering the
 
02:31:37.359 --> 02:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
they're likely going to be covering the
costs

02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
up to three and a half times
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
their average cost of instruction like
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
covering all those costs
 
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
covering all those costs
and

02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be covering twenty percent of
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
everything above that until ten times
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
which gets us into
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
plus

02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
plus
 
02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
plus
uh

02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh potentially
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
per student and uh
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
and and we so we need we need to walk
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
through this
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think in in some
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
studied manner uh in the coming year
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh providing advice and school districts
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
are they going to be how are they going
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to accommodate this and be
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
able to prepare for this
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
in their school budgets
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill already has an implementation
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
date of 2324 school year
 
02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.710 align:start position:0%
date of 2324 school year
so

02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the study commission
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
running through that
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
23-24 school year
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
we ought to be able to have some better
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
information for the legislature
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
to to be prepared to act uh in a second
 
02:32:55.439 --> 02:32:56.309 align:start position:0%
to to be prepared to act uh in a second
step

02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh down the road so that that's uh
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully i've laid that out and i'm
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions mr chairman
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
well senator thank you very much and it
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
just already the figures are going
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
through my head here are we talking
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
roughly around five million dollars per
 
02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:12.070 align:start position:0%
roughly around five million dollars per
year

02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
it could be that and it could be north
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
of that yeah
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes and and how that gets parsed out
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
between the school
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
school aid formulas and
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
the at the categorical aid that we've
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
got for special education
 
02:33:28.479 --> 02:33:29.429 align:start position:0%
got for special education
uh

02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
would needs to be considered thank you
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
representative

02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
sure thanks very much mr chair and thank
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
you very much senator khan for bringing
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
this in and also for um for uh adding
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
that level of complexity to um to what
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
what we thought was uh was a more
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward issue but um but i
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you actually bringing
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
up the language from 189
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
um one a
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i i went and took a look at it and
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
um and if that were to be amended to
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
to has reached the age 22. would that
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
basically also be saying that that any
 
02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:09.030 align:start position:0%
basically also be saying that that any
student

02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
would have a right to to attend their
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
public school until they reach the age
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
of 22. it would any student any student
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
let's try the condom and and and just to
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
to reflect on and what might be the
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
complication there
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
22 year old students in school with
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
can pose
 
02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
can pose
some

02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know challenges to manage the
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
different age groups and their
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
what they are entitled to do which is
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
it might be substances
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and thank you very much senator um
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
and and when we're talking about all
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
students i'm not just talking about
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
special education students i'm talking
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
about students that might choose a i
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
mean most students choose to
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
complete their high school
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know requirements and graduate with
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
their class when they're 17 or 18 years
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
old but should a student want to take
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
maybe more electives or
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
or other classes that don't necessarily
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
tack on credits that lead to graduation
 
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
tack on credits that lead to graduation
um

02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
they could they could extend that out
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
through uh through age um
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
21 under current law and um and 22.
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct well 21
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
under currently right and and and or
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
until they graduated so
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
many students are completing
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
all the credits they need for graduation
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
by the time that they reach
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
17 or 18. i mean the goal is for
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
students to complete a high school
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
education not to continue to
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't want to go too far down
 
02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.389 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't want to go too far down
that

02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
path but i
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i take is our as our primary
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to help students complete a
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
high school
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
competencies and qualify for graduation
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
from a public high school
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to provide adult
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
continuing education which school
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
districts can continue to to provide
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
right and the and the the charter career

right and the and the the charter career

academy
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
is sort of leveraging that um
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
by delaying the high school diploma
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
until until
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
a student has taken two years of
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
community college
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
i unders i i i
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
understand the proposal that there is
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
for that kind of
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
program right thank you
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go down that
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
road yeah i i understand reps and lekkas
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
i have two questions one uh totally
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
unrelated to each other
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
one of them is what does
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
a person do now once they reach 21
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
and they still need they can't support
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and all of that who pays
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
for their continuing care etc as it is
 
02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:18.710 align:start position:0%
for their continuing care etc as it is
now

02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question so it once a
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
student ages out of the
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
the services provided through public
 
02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:27.190 align:start position:0%
the services provided through public
education

02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
adult developmental services
 
02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:32.630 align:start position:0%
adult developmental services
the

02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
regional offices will provide
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
adult services through health and human
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
services the regional offices for
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:44.830 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
and

02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh and that's that's the transition
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and then
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
would a student be required to stay in
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
until the end of the year let's say they
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
turned 21 and they were looking forward
 
02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
turned 21 and they were looking forward
to

02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
being done with school even though
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
they could use more schooling
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
who makes that decision at that point
 
02:38:12.479 --> 02:38:13.670 align:start position:0%
who makes that decision at that point
thanks

02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
good clarification uh
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
a student can
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to graduate from high
 
02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to graduate from high
school

02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that happens we know that happens uh
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether you've got developmental
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
disabilities or not
 
02:38:27.439 --> 02:38:28.790 align:start position:0%
disabilities or not
and

02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:31.590 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to stay in school
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh
 
02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh
some

02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.190 align:start position:0%
some
students

02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
and their families will decide
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not in the best interest of
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
the child to continue to receive
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
educational services that in fact a
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
different kind of transition should
 
02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
different kind of transition should
happen

02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
happen
and

02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
developmental services will uh
 
02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:56.870 align:start position:0%
developmental services will uh
uh

02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
provide some assistance
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
below 21 years and and that is that is a
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
i mean that transition handoff is always
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
of concern to the families
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you are there further
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%

thank you representative ladd thank you
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
um so for the record my name is chris
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
bond i'm actually counsel to the
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
department of education and the state
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
board of education but i also serve in a
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
dual capacity where i am affiliated with
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and i'm
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
actually here
 
02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of attorney of attorney
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
general formella today to testify as to
 
02:40:27.359 --> 02:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
general formella today to testify as to
the

02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
the potential legal challenges that uh
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
not having the special ed services run
 
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
through age 22 or through age 21
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive i.e up until the 22nd birthday
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
may pose
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
so um i think senator khan did a nice
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
job sort of explaining um just to
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little further the case at
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
issue um just for the record
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:53.670 align:start position:0%
is um
kl

02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
kl
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
versus rhode island board of education
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the citation is 907 f third 639
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
so it i just want to clarify it is a
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
first circuit court of appeals case so
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the district court in rhode island
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
actually um found in favor of rhode
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
island and found that it was okay to not
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
provide the services up to age 22
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
but the first circuit reversed that on a
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
2-1 decision that's the decision here
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
that is as it's the first circuit court
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
of appeals that is binding precedent on
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so new hampshire is bound
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
this case law and
 
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's the reason
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
why we believe it would be a significant
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
challenge for us to defend a law
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
that and there would be a significant
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
risk that the law would be held to be
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the idea
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
if it were challenged and just to go
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
through sort of the logic of the case
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
the idea provides
 
02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:48.150 align:start position:0%
the idea provides
that

02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
states are required to provide a free
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
and appropriate public education to all
 
02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities residing in
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state between the ages of 3 and 21
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
inclusive and that 3 in 21 inclusive
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
language has been held to mean
 
02:42:01.279 --> 02:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
language has been held to mean
um

02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
until the the child turns 22.
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
now there's an exception to that at 20
 
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
usc 1412
 
02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:11.110 align:start position:0%
usc 1412
a1b1

02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
a1b1
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
which says that the obligation to
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
provide a free and appropriate public
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
education to those children um
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
does not apply with respect to children
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
aged 18 through 21 in a state to the
 
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
extent that its application to those
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
children would be inconsistent with
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
state law or practice and so new
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and many other states had
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
relied on that exception to not provide
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
the services up until the 22nd birthday
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
but what the court found in this case
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
was that because rhode island
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
had public dollars that supported adult
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
education programs beyond age 21 that
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
they could not avail themselves of that
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
exception um so specifically
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
the factors that the court says they the
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
first circuit will look at is whether
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's a significant level of state or
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
local government funding for adult
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
education whether there's public
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
administration or oversight of that
 
02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
educational process and whether that
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
process is designed to bring students up
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
to the level they would be at if they
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
completed high school and they found
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
those present here and then found that
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
that exception didn't apply so there's a
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
significant risk that if they looked at
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's program
 
02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's program
um

02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
they might make the similar conclusion
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
which is why we felt it important the
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee understand that that's the
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
substantial risk if they don't move that
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
age up to 22.
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions from the
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative waltz
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
attorney waltz
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so are you familiar with house
 
02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1513
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay so what i'm hearing you say is
 
02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:43.830 align:start position:0%
yes okay so what i'm hearing you say is
that

02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1513 is consistent with
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
federal language
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
but that
 
02:43:50.830 --> 02:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
394 if we were to change it from 21 to
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
22 is consistent with the requirements
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
of the first circuit
 
02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
of the first circuit
um

02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that because looking at 1513 that's
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what i'm hearing the languages
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
in federal law but that we would have to
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
provide services through 22
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so i think until the 22nd birthday i
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
may have misspoke through 21 inclusive
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
is the requirement
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
up until the 22nd
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
i apologize if i wasn't clear well it
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
was probably me not picking up the
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
nuance okay but but again 15 the the
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
house bill is the one that's consistent
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
with federal law so if we adopt that
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
then we're going to be consistent with
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
the first circuit decision then it just
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's not consistent with the first
 
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
it's not consistent with the first
circuit

02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay i i i am familiar with the bill i
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
had seen versions where it went up to
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
the 22nd birthday and amendments where
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
it didn't i don't know where that bill
 
02:44:57.030 --> 02:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
currently sits but if it does it to be
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with the holding
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
um in kl
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would have to go through the 22nd
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
birthday but i also want to make clear
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just highlighting the significant
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
risk the state faces that
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
there could be an argument that the
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
adult education program in new hampshire
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
is signific is significantly different
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
from rhode island in such a way that is
 
02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:18.870 align:start position:0%
from rhode island in such a way that is
meaningful

02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't done the research to know
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be probably a pretty uh
 
02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
that that would be probably a pretty uh
um

02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
discovery intensive process to figure
 
02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:26.630 align:start position:0%
discovery intensive process to figure
out

02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
what it was but the the state uh it is
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
clear from this decision that rhode
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
island wasn't funding all of adult
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
education um and they had some
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight and those were
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
found to be sufficient so i think that
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
just tightens the risk but um
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to be careful that i'm not
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
um so it sounds to me like the the
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that would have the least
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
exposure for the state is to simply say
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide special ed
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
services through a 22nd birthday
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's my understanding
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i should also add i meant to add um
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
we are aware of one advocacy group that
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
we believe is preparing a lawsuit
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
against the state um but they're waiting
 
02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
to see the outcome of this legislation
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
and then i became aware of another
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
parent who is preparing a due process
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
claim against their uh
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
school so um it's not just the risk that
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state will be sued but there's the
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
risk that um individual districts will
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
be sued too on the basis of this and we
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
are aware of at least one due process
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
claim that was brought against the
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
school district on the basis of the kl
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
case that case was settled so i don't
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
know what the results of that were i
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't privy to the settlement but um uh
 
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that the parent got the
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
services that they were requesting
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
because it was a pretty quick settlement
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative moffat do you have a
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thanks for taking my
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
question you just mentioned a parent
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
bringing a suit so given the age of
 
02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
majority being what it is
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:47:00.389 --> 02:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
what about the
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
i hate to say child or the word child
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
has been used over and over
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to this legislation i'm a
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor 15 13.
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
what if the
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
the student uh is at odds with the
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
parent on
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know if they're a special education
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
student do they surrender their their
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
sovereignty what if the student and the
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
parent don't agree on the course of
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
action for a 20 year old or whatever
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great question um first of
 
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
all i want to correct my statement i
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
said the parent i actually don't know if
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
it was a parent i should have said a
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
student i don't know if it was a parent
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
who brought it on behalf of the student
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
or the student who brought in their own
 
02:47:38.309 --> 02:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
capacity um
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
i i believe that would be my
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that would be on a
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis you could have a
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
child who had some sort of a court
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
finding that past the age of majority
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
they still had some sort of a guardian
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
who could be the parent but in other
 
02:47:52.870 --> 02:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
cases um just because someone's an ie
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
and on an iep certainly doesn't mean
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
that they're not competent to make those
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
decisions so there could be
 
02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
either situation you could have
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
students that could make those decisions
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
themselves whether to stay in school for
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
example as senator khan noted there's no
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
requirement to graduate from high school
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
so a student who's eligible for these
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
services doesn't necessarily have to
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
participate whether that's their
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
decision or the parents would depend on
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
the individual circumstances and who had
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated to be uh competent to
 
02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
make decisions for that child that's my
 
02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:22.070 align:start position:0%
make decisions for that child that's my
understanding

02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
sure okay thanks
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent luna thank you
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair and um and and thank
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
you attorney bond for uh for joining us
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
um this morning so would um
 
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
would would school districts if they
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to under current law be able to
 
02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.469 align:start position:0%
wanted to under current law be able to
um

02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
provide education through 21 inclusives
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
include inclusive today
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes my understanding is that they can
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
although under the current statutes they
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't receive any reimbursement from
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the state for special education services
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
beyond age 21. okay and a follow-up on
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
that yeah would they would they receive
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant from the uh from the
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
i am not certain i would have to look at
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you um my my
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
assumption would be no but i don't i
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't know for certain yeah no thank
 
02:49:14.710 --> 02:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
thanks and i i think that would be uh
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
obviously i think all this is sort of
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
funneling into what senator khan is
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
proposing and really understanding this
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
but yeah i was i was
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
interested in what the definition of
 
02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:26.389 align:start position:0%
interested in what the definition of
adma

02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
adma
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently used in law and just so
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
we all happen to have heard a bill last
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
week on adma so i was looking at the
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
definition of that and it's not clear to
 
02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
me either
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure i haven't looked at it recently so
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and you might not
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this question but the
 
02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
reason why these bills were brought
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
forth was because
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
parents were concerned about losing
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
services mid-year for their child
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
what do they do in another state i mean
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
if we bring it to 22 and you turn 22 in
 
02:49:58.560 --> 02:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
if we bring it to 22 and you turn 22 in
may

02:49:59.510 --> 02:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
or june or march or you're going to end
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be the same problem just moved up
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
a year so there is no solution you're
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
saying you think to this problem
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
other than spending
 
02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
getting into the rabbit hole that
 
02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative senator khan said
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um first of
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
all i i want to make clear i'm not here
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
to uh to weigh in on any policy matters
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and so i certainly understand that's an
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
important consideration
 
02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
important consideration
um

02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
i would say there's nothing i see in the
 
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
kl decision that would prevent
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that would say
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
you can complete the school year or the
 
02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
you can complete the school year or the
semester

02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
semester
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
once you
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
achieve age 22 but if you're going to
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
try to cut it off before 22 that's when
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
you run into the kl decisions so um
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
the merits of cutting off mid-year or
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
not i understand that so um you know
 
02:50:58.230 --> 02:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
there are so rhode island has made this
 
02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
change because they were the direct
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
subject of the lawsuit
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
maine upon seeing the decision and
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're also in the first circuit with
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
us so this is binding precedent on them
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have made the decision to go
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
through age
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
through the 22nd birthday not through
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
age 22. through the 22nd birthday i um
 
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that continues
 
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that to encompass more of a
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
school year it could but that would be
 
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a policy discretion area so
 
02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:24.950 align:start position:0%
sort of a policy discretion area so
yep

02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
cornell thank you thank you so if their
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
birthday is in november and they turn 22
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
in november
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we're just kind of perpetuating what
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do away within they
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
could say okay you're 22 it's november
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to finish the school
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
year that
 
02:51:47.269 --> 02:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think if i'm understanding the
 
02:51:50.550 --> 02:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
question correctly um
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes um the what the what the idea
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
requires according to kl is that in a
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
state where there is public support for
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
education as defined by the kl court and
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get too specific about
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
that because that would be the subject
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
potentially of a lawsuit but in that
 
02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
potentially of a lawsuit but in that
circumstance

02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
the special education services need to
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
be provided up until the 22nd birthday
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
so you could have a cliff
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
scenario where november 15th is the
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
birthday and that's the last day and
 
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
they they were in class on the 14th and
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're not there on the 16th you could
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
do that i can understand why for policy
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
reasons that might not be palatable
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that would prevent you
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
from letting them finish out that school
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
year but if you try to do it on the
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
other end and you try to say well once
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
they reach their 21st birthday we'll let
 
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
them finish then you've got a problem
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
because if they're still 21 when the
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
next school year starts under this
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
potential whole application of this
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
holding there'd still be a problem so
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
you do have that flexibility but only
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
when you're over the sort of limit
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's set by kl not not before
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and uh fellow
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee members uh for the record
 
02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
glenn cordelli representing tuftonboro
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
moultonborough and sandwich in the
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard quite a bit of testimony
 
02:53:27.359 --> 02:53:28.469 align:start position:0%
you've heard quite a bit of testimony
about

02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
age 21 inclusive rhode island maine and
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
so forth and and the need for us
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably to do something
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
we did have
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
hb 1513
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
which passed the house and was sent to
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
i attended the hearing on that in the
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
senate and
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
i got the impression that the senate
 
02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
might look to uh amend uh that bill
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
um based on some of the similar
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh you just heard
 
02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh you just heard
um

02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
my amendment that is making its way
 
02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.110 align:start position:0%
my amendment that is making its way
around

02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
around
um

02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh basically says
 
02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
uh basically says
um

02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:15.359 --> 02:54:16.469 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's not just 21 inclusive but if they
 
02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
it's not just 21 inclusive but if they
turn

02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
turn
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
22 on
 
02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:25.670 align:start position:0%
22 on
thursday

02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
02:54:27.349 --> 02:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
they can finish out the semester they're
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
not kicked out of school
 
02:54:32.830 --> 02:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
the day after their 22nd birthday
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think that that's
 
02:54:36.319 --> 02:54:38.070 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think that that's
um

02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.349 align:start position:0%
um
reasonable

02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
um as a policy for the state
 
02:54:42.399 --> 02:54:43.990 align:start position:0%
um as a policy for the state
um

02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
i had done some research trying to find
 
02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
out what other states how other states
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
approach it
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i could find in a
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
chart a global
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
state by state comparison
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually dated back to
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
2004 with a document from the us
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
department of education um so it's a
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
little bit old a little bit dated but
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
even back then it was all over the place
 
02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of um
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
what states did in this regard
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
and there were certainly states that
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
said um
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
up until their 22nd birthday
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i've talked to a
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
an education advocate here in new
 
02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire who thinks
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
they should
 
02:55:31.910 --> 02:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
leave school on you know right after
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
their 22nd birthday
 
02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:35.190 align:start position:0%
their 22nd birthday
um

02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
but i i'm taking the approach and this
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for your consideration
 
02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
they would finish out the semester
 
02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
during which they turn 22.
 
02:55:46.399 --> 02:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
during which they turn 22.
um

02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
i i think that's more reasonable
 
02:55:50.479 --> 02:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
i i think that's more reasonable
um

02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:52.710 align:start position:0%
um
approach

02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
for us as a policy and also
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
for the student and their family
 
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i thank you very much for your
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
attention thank you are there any
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions for representative cordelli
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative baum and then
 
02:56:07.349 --> 02:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative i think tanner had her
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative cadelli uh
 
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
do you know that if all high schools in
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
run on a semester program
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure
 
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
so those that don't would mean to the
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
end of the year rather the end of the
 
02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:31.110 align:start position:0%
end of the year rather the end of the
semester

02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question very
 
02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
similar question
 
02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know our school year the school year
 
02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
that i worked under was divided into
 
02:56:44.309 --> 02:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
four quarters
 
02:56:44.319 --> 02:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
four quarters
um

02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if semester is
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
in statute or whether we need to have a
 
02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:52.830 align:start position:0%
in statute or whether we need to have a
better

02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:54.469 align:start position:0%
better
definition

02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
we certainly could
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
play with the
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
for the further questions representative
 
02:57:04.319 --> 02:57:05.269 align:start position:0%
for the further questions representative
luno

02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
luno
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
sure thanks very much mr chair how would
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:14.399 --> 02:57:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:18.870 align:start position:0%
uh i
uh

02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:20.469 --> 02:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
02:57:20.479 --> 02:57:22.469 align:start position:0%
let's see
i'll

02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
those programs um should follow um the
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
law in terms of uh uh the definition of
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability
 
02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
so follow-up yes so so we've
 
02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
we've already concluded that that under
 
02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
current law and under
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
um uh whatever uh language comes out of
 
02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
um uh whatever uh language comes out of
394

02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
394
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
that that the the age um whether it's
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
until they turn 21 or until
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
22 they turned 22 that that a student
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
would be entitled to
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
to essentially attend school
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
and um and and potentially um
 
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
and um and and potentially um
uh

02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
the adequate education grant and i
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
believe the adequate education grant um
 
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
formula is what the efa program uh
 
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
follows as well correct so i guess
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
very straightforward would a would a
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
student who's who's uh who has an efa
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
and being homeschooled
 
02:58:30.550 --> 02:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
any student
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
who has an efa and is being homeschooled
 
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
um and potentially going to private
 
02:58:38.790 --> 02:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
school be able to receive that efa grant
 
02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
from the from the state until um until
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
the end
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
on your on your amendment here until the
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
end of the semester in which they turn
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
22 years old
 
02:58:54.870 --> 02:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just thinking about it as i
 
02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
think back
 
02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
on the legislation for the education
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts i think it says 3 to 18
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
but i would have to go back and look at
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
the version that was actually signed
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
got three more cards here
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
02:59:51.670 --> 02:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
jane bergeron and i'm the executive
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire
 
02:59:55.590 --> 02:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
association of special ed administrators
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:59:57.359 --> 02:59:58.469 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
testify

02:59:58.469 --> 02:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
i will keep my uh comments brief
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
our association certainly recognizes the
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
importance of providing services to
 
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities
 
03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
through age 21 or
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
different scenarios that we've discussed
 
03:00:16.230 --> 03:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
today some of the things that we would
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
like to bring to your attention
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
is based on on the fiscal impact and
 
03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that our policy makers
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
fully understand the implications
 
03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
upon our taxpayers
 
03:00:28.710 --> 03:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
you will note that
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note with the bill is focused
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
on and dedicated to
 
03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
children and youth who are placed in
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
residential settings and those who are
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
placed in alternative school settings
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
we know that this bill will impact
 
03:00:46.469 --> 03:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
a good number of kids with disabilities
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
in our public schools
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
and those numbers are not included or
 
03:00:51.439 --> 03:00:52.630 align:start position:0%
and those numbers are not included or
considered

03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill so when you think about your
 
03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
in the bill so when you think about your
kids

03:00:56.950 --> 03:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
who have transition planning or younger
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
adults they tend to be
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
young adults who have quite a bit of
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
services and support
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
so many of them are out in the community
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
they require specialized transportation
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're required job coaches some have
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
one-to-one nurses some have behavioral
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
specialists with them many of these
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
services are contracted out to vendors
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
to provide these services out in the
 
03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:27.349 align:start position:0%
to provide these services out in the
community

03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:01:29.910 --> 03:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so as you think about
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
a bill like this do consider
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers of kids who are currently in
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
our public schools not in residential
 
03:01:40.230 --> 03:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
schools or in alternative settings
 
03:01:41.590 --> 03:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
because that
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
certainly will have an impact on
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
our community our our taxpayers and we
 
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure folks are taking
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
that into consideration
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
so i would open it up for uh questions
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
also you heard today
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
comments about letting kids stay through
 
03:02:00.790 --> 03:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year defining what
 
03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
school year is many of our children and
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
youth have extended school year programs
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
does that is that included in that so
 
03:02:10.230 --> 03:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
not only defining semester but defining
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
the school year i think would also be
 
03:02:16.230 --> 03:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
important for us to be thinking about
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i've got a question
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
for you in terms of medicaid
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have a number of our
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
special ed students which are medicaid
 
03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
special ed students which are medicaid
qualifying

03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we get reimbursement from medicaid
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
for those services
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
um would this continue
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
to the age that we're talking about here
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't have the answer for
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
that but i could get it for you
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
or yeah or maybe becky would know thank
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%

you talked before 17 18 percent or
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
rather than what i did the number we
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
generally assume for new hampshire
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
youngsters that are involved in special
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
ed services
 
03:03:21.429 --> 03:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
do you have a breakdown of a
 
03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
guesstimation if you will of the numbers
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
that actually are in the 18 to 21 range
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
of that percentage
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information but we can
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%

thank you very much jane thank you uh
 
03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:51.760 align:start position:0%

03:04:04.230 --> 03:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
chairman lad
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and commission
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i supported hb 1513 as it was um
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
written i know it was amended to what sb
 
03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
394 is now
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
um and as the federal language is age 21
 
03:04:23.190 --> 03:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
inclusive i believe research support age
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
21 inclusive i would also support going
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
beyond that as i had said in the 394
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing in the senate the state of
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
minnesota goes up to age 26.
 
03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:33.510 align:start position:0%
minnesota goes up to age 26.
um

03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
every child should be given every
 
03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity and this is from the federal
 
03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
government the usda to complete a
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
full-blown high school diploma because
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
that leads it basically leads to a path
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
for a better education the federal
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
district court that they're talking
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
about in the rhode island case is the
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
one that governs our area because we are
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
district one
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
and if a kid with disabilities gets
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
told they have to leave school with a
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
high school diploma i don't see why a
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
normal student wouldn't be told the same
 
03:04:57.279 --> 03:04:58.469 align:start position:0%
normal student wouldn't be told the same
um

03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the child or guardian can choose to
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
leave school at any time that is the way
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
it works um we've actually had
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
a parent has not filed for guardianship
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
yet their kid turned 18 and the school
 
03:05:12.389 --> 03:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
came to the kid and said you don't
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
really want to come to school you're not
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
interested why don't you just sign up
 
03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
kid signs out it's not reversible
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's not reversible
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
um so we often tell parents get the
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
guardianship as soon as possible
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and be very specific about education
 
03:05:26.640 --> 03:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
um and be very specific about education
services

03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
adult services is not
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything to really ascribe to because
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
once the student is done with school and
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
michelle mckeon just wrote an article
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
about this where she said keep your kid
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
in school as long as possible because
 
03:05:42.870 --> 03:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
adult services has no goals
 
03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
it has no interaction with other people
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
other than maybe going to the mall or
 
03:05:48.630 --> 03:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to the supermarket
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
and it has no way of pushing you further
 
03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
towards an independent living or
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
employment my son in particular has been
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
registered with vocational rehab since
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
the age of 14
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
and thus far he has not completed a
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
single internship rotation
 
03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:04.630 align:start position:0%
single internship rotation
so

03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
attorney bond also quoted in the 1513
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
hearing that 40 states went to age 21
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
inclusive which is 22nd birthday so i'm
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
here to say that we will support age 21
 
03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive we will support beyond age 21
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive but we will not accept less
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
because we know the federal government
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
guaranteed us more
 
03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
so we're here to support age 21
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
inclusive or more
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
and and also on the adequacy funding the
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
doa had informed me that the adequacy
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
funding is based off attendance on
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
october 1st so if the student is in
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
attendance on october 1st the school
 
03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
retains the funding for that year
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the student moves
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
out of the district or anything like
 
03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
out of the district or anything like
that

03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
nancy thank you very much
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're at the end of our pink card we do
 
03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
have a technical assistance as needed
 
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
from rebecca fradette
 
03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:06.870 align:start position:0%
from rebecca fradette
rebecca

03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton had gotten some
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions that she forwarded on to me
 
03:07:12.950 --> 03:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
regarding numbers
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so currently we have four students
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
who are age 21
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
in school right now
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
and they will all be
 
03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
exiting at the end of the school year
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
we did have 20 students who started the
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
school year at age 21 at age 20 and when
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
they turned 21 they were exited um at or
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
before their birthday
 
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
so there's only four left that are
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
beyond 21. we currently have 186
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
students who are age 20
 
03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
and they um but
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
unless i go through each individual
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
student i don't know who is going to
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
continue on until past their 21st
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
birthday but there are 186 students
 
03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:52.550 align:start position:0%
birthday but there are 186 students
um

03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the question was how many students
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
will this bill include if we use the 21
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
inclusive language so theoretically it
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
could include those 186 students
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
um until their 22nd birthday if this if
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
this is the case the cost at minimum
 
03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
what we figure is a cost per pupil when
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
we do special education aid we work with
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
caitlin davis's office to determine that
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
number currently the cost per pupil is
 
03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:18.870 align:start position:0%
number currently the cost per pupil is
17985.66

03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
so if every single student were to
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
continue 180 stick six students and
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to send you this diana has
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
it to send to you um it would be right
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
around 3.3 million dollars at just the
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil if every one of those
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
students went to the 3.5 times the cost
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
per pupil that we provided for special
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
education aid it would be about 11
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
million so those were numbers that were
 
03:08:43.510 --> 03:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
asked of me
 
03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
asked of me
um

03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
currently the way the law is written if
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
anyone stays beyond 21 and if we even if
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
you changed it to 22 we would not
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
provide any special education aid or
 
03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
idea funding to those students because
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
our state law would say up to 21.
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
we do not provide it to students right
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
now if they turn 21 and they stay in
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
school for the remainder of that year
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
because our law does say up to 21
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then so but if they did stay it
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be the same cost as i had listed
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
for those other students but those were
 
03:09:16.230 --> 03:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions that had been presented to me
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions represented
 
03:09:21.359 --> 03:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions represented
walls

03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
walls
 
03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
so if we change this law if we change
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
this law to say that we're going to
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
provide education through 22nd birthday
 
03:09:32.550 --> 03:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
does that mean the funding will then
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
follow from the state yep so if you
 
03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
change the law i would be able to
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide funding up until their 22nd
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
birthday um and then if they went beyond
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
their 22nd birthday i would not be able
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
to provide special education aid or idea
 
03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
to provide special education aid or idea
funding

03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes if we change the law to
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
say this the end of the school year of
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
their 22nd birthday would you be able to
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund the full school year yes i would
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
so whatever change we make here is going
 
03:09:57.990 --> 03:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be determining of your funding yes
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
so that closes uh that's the last card
 
03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
unless there's somebody else in the
 
03:10:12.309 --> 03:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
audience to speak on this bill and so we
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
will close
 
03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:32.309 align:start position:0%
will close
394.

03:10:32.309 --> 03:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
yeah hold on
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.359 --> 03:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
two

03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%

oh gee i didn't know
 
03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:18.150 align:start position:0%
oh gee i didn't know
whoops

03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
i know what
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
no we we'll we'd have to take it in the
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
order i guess
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
so what we could do is we could have 4
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
20 introduced then we can recess it to
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
follow 421
 
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
and uh 421
 
03:11:56.720 --> 03:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
and uh 421
grant

03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%

03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
can you come forward and please
 
03:12:02.309 --> 03:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
introduce 420 and then we'll recess it
 
03:12:04.229 --> 03:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
immediately absolutely and then you can
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
let senator hennessey know what we did
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
i will be very brief but the department
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
of education here is to back me up when
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lad members of the

senator aaron hennessey its prime
sponsor

03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes an ongoing
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need education funding
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
grant this bill will allow additional
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
funding to go to the neediest of our
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
schools through the state
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
based on the town's property equalized
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive free and reduced
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
lunch so let me just go through that
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
formula again you calculate the property
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation for each town you
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
then divide it by the number of pupils
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
if that number is
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
less than a million dollars you receive
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
the full amount of the grant you then
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
get a sliding scale down
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
if it's more than six million dollars
 
03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
per free and reduced lunch pupil you do
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
not receive a grant
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
this extraordinary need grant is set up
 
03:13:09.750 --> 03:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
as an ongoing grant in addition to the
 
03:13:12.550 --> 03:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid and the ongoing 35 million
 
03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in relief aid
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
we added in the budget last year this
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill would send additional funding to
 
03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
towns on top of what was accomplished in
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
the budget an additional 14.7 million
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
dollars for school year 2023
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
these grants are intended to provide
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
consistency and stability for school
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
districts therefore they will not be
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
limited to one-time use towns qualifying
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
for this extraordinary need grant can be
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
found in the fiscal note at the end of
 
03:13:40.630 --> 03:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
the bill i would defer questions to the
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%

bill
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
421 relative to dual concurrent
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment for career and technical
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
education center students and if i may
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
say as an aside i had
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of 420 as well i
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
wanted you all to know there's
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support coming out of the
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
senate for that bill
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
but um 421
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
um deals with our existing dual and
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program under
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 188 a highly effective and strongly
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
supported program that lets high school
 
03:14:43.110 --> 03:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
students take a couple of classes
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
under doing concurrent enrollment save a
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money and give them a leg up on
 
03:14:50.950 --> 03:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
their career when they go on to
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
community college or other higher
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
education the bill makes a couple of
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
changes um the funding the fund for this
 
03:14:58.160 --> 03:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
changes um the funding the fund for this
bill

03:14:59.269 --> 03:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
was transferred to
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh over to the community college system
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so they're administratoring it now
 
03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
and under their current
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
practices uh they
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
release funding at the time of student
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment which is what we do
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
for adequacy grants right so it's kind
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the same thing as as that
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
there had been some concern from the
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education that well if
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
they if you got the money
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know what will you really do to make
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
sure the student stays enrolled and
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
completes the course and so on
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
and you know i i get that you know and i
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
talked with commissioner aw
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
about it and um
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know it was also assured by
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
community college assistant new
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire they do they do a lot and the
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
high schools the high schools
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
particularly do a lot because that's
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
where the courses are taught to make
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure the students are are completing the
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
courses but but nonetheless we thought
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
then down at the bottom of the bill a
 
03:15:58.710 --> 03:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
new in uh paragraph
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment that this is language the
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner thought would be a good way
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with his concerns about when the
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
funds are going out so it says there's
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to be an annual report
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
on student enrollment successful
 
03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
completion grades of students and doing
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment courses
 
03:16:14.239 --> 03:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment courses
and

03:16:15.590 --> 03:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would be important to have to see
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue around whether
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
students are completing or at a
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
different rate that they might have um
 
03:16:22.399 --> 03:16:23.990 align:start position:0%
different rate that they might have um
otherwise

03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
now the other part of this bill uh mr
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
chairman really kind of is in tandem to
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
what uh we did in house bill 1661. it's
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
just you know these two bills came to
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
came out of um
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
the study committee and our ongoing work
 
03:16:37.279 --> 03:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
the study committee and our ongoing work
on

03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
on ctes i must say i'm a little jealous
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
that house bill 61 got a 35 million
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
dollar parking garage
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i want something on this too all
 
03:16:46.319 --> 03:16:47.349 align:start position:0%
so i want something on this too all
right

03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
well we can put anything you want on it
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyhow but maybe the uh maybe this maybe
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
the cte
 
03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
the cte
mobile

03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
mobile
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
mobile vehicle can park at the new
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
garage okay so it'll be good um but the
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
the basic principle here is that we want
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
and you you and i share this value mr
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
chairman others on the committee we
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
believe that career and technical
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
education is fundamentally kind of a
 
03:17:11.429 --> 03:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
right for students in our
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
our state and we want to make sure that
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
every eligible student
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh can
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
enroll in career and technical education
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
no matter where they may be because this
 
03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
is our future work source for us it's
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students and their
 
03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:26.469 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students and their
aspirations

03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
aspirations
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
there we had wanted to make sure that
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
students who are not public school
 
03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
students who are not public school
students

03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to take queer
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
technical education
 
03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
there has been an interpretation that
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
because of the way the
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
bill the the law is referenced that
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
those students who are in non-public
 
03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
schools um could not take advantage of
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
career and technical education and i
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
personally you know with education
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
freedom savings account you know we're
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to have more students who are
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
taking that option and going to
 
03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know private schools and i i want
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
them the private schools are going to be
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
offering the cte programs but we can and
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
we ought to make sure they can take
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
those classes as well so that's why you
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
see it here the governing body
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
institution is in the case of non-public
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
schools shall develop and adopt a policy
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
permitting students residing in a
 
03:18:14.710 --> 03:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
district or attendance of the nonpublic
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
school from grades 10 11 12 to
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
participate in dual concurrent
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment programs so just that
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
reference there the governing body not
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
the school board we'll open it up so
 
03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
03:18:26.950 --> 03:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
the students who are in those other
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
other schools are now going to be
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
eligible to be in the doing concur
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment program so i think it's
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
pretty simple mr chairman but um there
 
03:18:36.790 --> 03:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
it is and i know that we have both beth
 
03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
doran and shannon reed here
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh to to tag team on on
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
how this you know what the program is if
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
you have more questions about that and
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
and how this benefits uh the students
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator waters and
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
before i open up to the committee i do
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
have one question
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
and the question is dealing with line 14
 
03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
where it says or in attendance at the
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have a number of non-public schools
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
such as
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
kua holderness school
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
where the students are not residents of
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
so should it read
 
03:19:17.910 --> 03:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
or is a resident and in attendance at
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
well um i see what you're getting at uh
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think that that's best answered by
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
beth or
 
03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
or shannon
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
i mean this this wording is a little
 
03:19:35.429 --> 03:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
tricky and i i don't want to
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
get ahead of myself
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
i will ask that question representative
 
03:19:40.800 --> 03:19:41.830 align:start position:0%
i will ask that question representative
porter

03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%

03:19:49.520 --> 03:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
say one of the problems um
representative

03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think that the or in attendance
 
03:19:55.359 --> 03:19:57.190 align:start position:0%
i think that the or in attendance
um

03:19:57.190 --> 03:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a student who's
 
03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
taking the education freedom
 
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
savings account and they're not you know
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to another
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
what is the school happens to be outside
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
the district i mean anyways i'll let
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
them talk about it but i just want to
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we're being
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
inclusive um so that
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me i'm sorry
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's fine i know how mines work um or
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't work
 
03:20:20.960 --> 03:20:22.630 align:start position:0%
don't work
maybe

03:20:22.630 --> 03:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
you said that senator i didn't say that
 
03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
you said that senator i didn't say that
um

03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
can the
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
state tell a non-public school or
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
private school that they have to do
 
03:20:32.319 --> 03:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
private school that they have to do
something

03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
no but
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
it can certainly tell them it's a great
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for their students
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
but the bill says that shall develop and
 
03:20:47.190 --> 03:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy permitting students
 
03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry i misanswered that i i i
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
03:20:58.229 --> 03:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know if we're offering this and and
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
schools want to take advantage of it
 
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
they ought to have a policy
 
03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
for that opportunity
 
03:21:03.520 --> 03:21:05.110 align:start position:0%
for that opportunity
so

03:21:05.110 --> 03:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah are there further questions of
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
senator waters
 
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for hanging loose along with
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%

obviously i'd be available for questions
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
that may come up later in the hearing
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:21:27.190 --> 03:21:27.200 align:start position:0%

you're both representing
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
community college system we are thank

good afternoon i think my testimony was
 
03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
probably written as good morning um
 
03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to come
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
and talk about uh senate bill 421 i want
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
to provide just a very brief bit of
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
background on these programs
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago the community
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
college system created dual and
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment programs in new
 
03:22:03.190 --> 03:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire um the largest of which is
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
called the running start program
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
which is a program where high school
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
students take courses at their high
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
school during their school day
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me taught by their high school
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
teachers who are who are acting really
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the college faculty
 
03:22:18.389 --> 03:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
member to teach that course and the
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
student gets high school credit and the
 
03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
student gets college credit for that
 
03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
student gets college credit for that
course

03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's a very successful program it
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
enrolls about 8 000 students every year
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
who take one or more of these dual
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
credit courses gives students a real um
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
well running start on their college
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
education in a way that is accessible to
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
them and affordable
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
and it covers a real range of
 
03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
and it covers a real range of
disciplines

03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
disciplines
 
03:22:41.190 --> 03:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to running start we also
 
03:22:43.750 --> 03:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
offer a program called early college
 
03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
which is similar in that it it confers
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
both high school and college credit but
 
03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
but in early college students will
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually go to the college campus and
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
take a course so there's a sort of a
 
03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:55.269 align:start position:0%
take a course so there's a sort of a
nuance

03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
nuance
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
difference between those two
 
03:22:56.960 --> 03:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
difference between those two
um

03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then there's also east art which is
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
similar but the courses are taken online
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the virtual
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
vlax virtual learning academy so those
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
are the three different kinds of dual
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment programs
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
offered through the community colleges
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
about four years ago
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
a um
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
a scholarship fund was created it was
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
established and created
 
03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:20.630 align:start position:0%
established and created
um

03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
to support
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment in stem
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
and stem-related
 
03:23:27.269 --> 03:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh courses
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a subject actually of 421
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
not the courses writ large but this
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity for stem and stem
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
related courses
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
and then two years ago
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
cte courses was were added to that um
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
grouping of courses that could be
 
03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
supported through the scholarship
 
03:23:46.389 --> 03:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
funding so initially in this program the
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
funding ran through the department of
 
03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
funding ran through the department of
education

03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
and at the end of every semester the
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
community colleges would inform the doe
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh the number of students who
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
participated and the doe would
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
essentially remit
 
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
the funding to the community college
 
03:24:00.800 --> 03:24:01.910 align:start position:0%
the funding to the community college
system

03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:24:03.429 --> 03:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
to cover their the cost of their
 
03:24:03.439 --> 03:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
to cover their the cost of their
enrollment

03:24:04.950 --> 03:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the last um budget the department
 
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
came in and indicated that it was no
 
03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:09.670 align:start position:0%
came in and indicated that it was no
longer

03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
longer
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
to fill that role
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they had left the program out of
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
their budget um citing you know
 
03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
their budget um citing you know
administrative

03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
burdens of the program
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
the house finance committee really
 
03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
wanting this program to move forward um
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
and represent vlad
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
was involved in that effort as well
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked the community colleges if we would
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
then administer the program so we it
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
could remain an opportunity for new
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire students we said we would
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we have been
 
03:24:38.070 --> 03:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
administering the program since then so
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
the funding then comes directly to the
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
community college and we essentially
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
account for it based on student
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
participation at the end of a given
 
03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
participation at the end of a given
semester

03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
semester
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
does that more or less make sense okay
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
so if senate bill 421 really relates to
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the the funding program for those stem
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
stem related and cte courses
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
and as senator waters noted it makes two
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
um tweaks really to the program which we
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
see as serving the interests of fairness
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and process improvement
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the first change is really the
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
process improvement um change and that
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
the payment would be triggered upon the
 
03:25:14.479 --> 03:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
the payment would be triggered upon the
student

03:25:15.830 --> 03:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
starting the course not upon successful
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
completion of the course that aligns
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
with payment practices generally for our
 
03:25:24.550 --> 03:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
colleges and i think probably most most
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
educational organizations and it
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
streamlines the administration for us
 
03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
because we we can do that at the
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
beginning and don't have to kind of um
 
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
catch up at the end with where you may
 
03:25:35.359 --> 03:25:36.150 align:start position:0%
catch up at the end with where you may
have

03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
a variety of different outcomes
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then the second
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me the second change
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
just adds
 
03:25:44.399 --> 03:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
just adds
the

03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
those non-public schools
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
that currently have a running start in
 
03:25:53.190 --> 03:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
them for example but
 
03:25:56.070 --> 03:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
for purpose of this funding program
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't really fit within the language of
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
the program
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
as it is currently written so
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
right now for a school
 
03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
to have its students eligible for the
 
03:26:06.640 --> 03:26:07.750 align:start position:0%
to have its students eligible for the
funding

03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
the school or the school board or the
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
school district needs to
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
enter into an agreement with the
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
community colleges and that basically
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
just outlines how this all works
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
but because the language of the program
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
says the school board of each school
 
03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:22.630 align:start position:0%
says the school board of each school
district

03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
then that pr that really leaves out
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
schools like
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh trinity high school in manchester
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
bishop brady here in concord schools
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
that are very much part of the ecosystem
 
03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's communities and where
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
students go but are just left out of the
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
language of this of this bill um i mean
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the current program
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that is what the what the bill does
 
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
the the senate amended it to add the
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
annual report which we think is
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
certainly a reasonable request um so
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
that we report we will report student
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
performance metrics on an annual basis
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the department of education
 
03:26:55.680 --> 03:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
to the department of education
um

03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:59.190 --> 03:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that that's essentially the outline
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
and this is really in the context of a
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
program running start that's been around
 
03:27:02.479 --> 03:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
program running start that's been around
for

03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
just about 20 years has steadily evolved
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
in all that time and really grown very
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
very well and very effectively for new
 
03:27:11.190 --> 03:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire students and families
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
we um we'll be happy to answer any
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions that you have about the the
 
03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill or the program and before i turn it
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
over for questions though i'd like to
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
just ask my colleague beth doran who
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
runs this program and runs our college
 
03:27:25.990 --> 03:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
access programs generally if i've left
 
03:27:28.229 --> 03:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
anything out that you'd like to add or
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
or clarify
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
no you you have not left anything
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
anything out that's very comprehensive
 
03:27:39.510 --> 03:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent tanner
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if my
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
memory serves me correct uh in order for
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
this for the uh
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
college course to be taught at the high
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
school level the teacher has to have
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
certain requirements
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering um how that's
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
how that's going to work in in some of
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
these non-public schools like perhaps
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
prenda or
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
kai which are micro schools that don't
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
have certified teachers or
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in any
 
03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:12.309 align:start position:0%
um in any
will

03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
they they would need to be held to the
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
same standard mostly because we in order
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
to maintain the integrity of the program
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
the high school teachers need to have
 
03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
the same requirements as our adjunct
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
faculty so that's an area where we
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
really try to stick with exactly what is
 
03:28:31.840 --> 03:28:32.950 align:start position:0%
really try to stick with exactly what is
required

03:28:32.950 --> 03:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
of any collet anybody teaching a college
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
course within the community college
 
03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
course within the community college
system

03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:28:40.710 --> 03:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
i might add that that's one of the
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
reasons why we put in the national
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
alliance for concurrent enrollment
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
program that is a program which
 
03:28:46.319 --> 03:28:47.670 align:start position:0%
program that is a program which
addresses

03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
all those issues that you're thinking of
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
so the standards are high
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
they must be the same as offered by the
 
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
university itself or the community
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
college system itself exactly yeah with
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
their accreditation process
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad you may know the
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
answer i have forgotten i'm sure they
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
know the answer uh home school
 
03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
know the answer uh home school
youngsters

03:29:12.070 --> 03:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
how how do they participate in this
 
03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:16.469 align:start position:0%
how how do they participate in this
program

03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
they would not necessarily participate
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
in running start unless they're
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
attending the the high school for a
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
course or two but they have the
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in any of our
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
early college courses on the college
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
campus or our e-star courses and
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
honestly a good portion of our early
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
college courses where students come to
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
take the courses on campus as well as
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
these start our home school students
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman you're welcome thank
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
you are there any schools
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
community college system level schools
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
that are are beyond the community is the
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
university system or is our is
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
snoo getting involved with this process
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
i know at various points there have been
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
other colleges and universities that
 
03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:03.670 align:start position:0%
other colleges and universities that
have

03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
um offered dual credit options i
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
they're not as comprehensive as what the
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
as that partnership with new hampshire
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
high schools and i don't know if they're
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
still currently
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
doing that but
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment as you
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
know has sort of taken off
 
03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
nationally it's i think it's probably in
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
just about every state in one form or
 
03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
just about every state in one form or
another

03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
i had a couple courses that they were
 
03:30:33.510 --> 03:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
offering for dual enrollment but um
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
really this is a
 
03:30:36.710 --> 03:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
writ large this is a
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
program of the community college system
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
my question sharon is are they also
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
chasing the scholarship money are they
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
they they go in they get that 150
 
03:30:48.150 --> 03:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
wherever you are 200
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program is only for dual
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment courses taken
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the community
 
03:30:54.560 --> 03:30:55.349 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the community
college

03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thanks
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
very much beth and shannon for joining
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
us this afternoon um sort of a a
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
technical question based on what senator
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
waters was was saying and and he was
 
03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
saying how the
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
language change down on lines 12 through
 
03:31:16.479 --> 03:31:17.510 align:start position:0%
language change down on lines 12 through
14

03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
14
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
very very specific to i think include um
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
as you say shannon schools like bishop
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
brady and trinity but i'm just wondering
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
how do those changes made in section two
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
translate into
 
03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
translate into
students

03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
from let's say bishop brady
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh being able to um to participate in
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment programs
 
03:31:46.229 --> 03:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
um in that instance they already do
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are already those courses offered
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
there but they don't have access to this
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
03:31:57.990 --> 03:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
for that so so that's what i'm talking
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
about so so let's just
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair so in looking at
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
section two
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
let's just say um bishop brady the
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
governing body bishop brady develops a
 
03:32:08.720 --> 03:32:10.309 align:start position:0%
governing body bishop brady develops a
policy

03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
so now the student at bishop brady in
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
grades 10 11 12 can participate in dual
 
03:32:17.349 --> 03:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
or concurrent enrollment programs now
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
let's go up to section one
 
03:32:19.279 --> 03:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
let's go up to section one
um

03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm just reading from lines three
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and four which is established at 150 per
 
03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:27.429 align:start position:0%
and four which is established at 150 per
course

03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
to the ccsnh institution where a high
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
school or a cte student enrolls in a
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment class
 
03:32:35.680 --> 03:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment class
um

03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
high school is defined in the statute as
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
194 23 the term high school shall mean a
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
public school or public academy
 
03:32:54.870 --> 03:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
comprising and it gets into grade spans
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering
 
03:32:56.640 --> 03:32:59.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering
how

03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
how this
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
i mean i it's clear the intent i agree
 
03:33:07.510 --> 03:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
on the intent i'm just stuck on the um
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
on on how it passes through the various
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
sort of filters
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
in uh in section one where you've got to
 
03:33:14.080 --> 03:33:14.870 align:start position:0%
in uh in section one where you've got to
be

03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
you've got to be attending a high school
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
or cte um i would say that's a very good
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
question and one that we should take up
 
03:33:21.359 --> 03:33:22.309 align:start position:0%
question and one that we should take up
with

03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
potentially with legislative drafting
 
03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:25.269 align:start position:0%
potentially with legislative drafting
yeah

03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay thanks that had not come up before
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a question and and
 
03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:30.469 align:start position:0%
as a question and and
and

03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:32.070 --> 03:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
in all fairness i don't know if the
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
definition definition of high school in
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
194 23 applies to this section or not
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say that it's limited to
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the section
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
that it's in there's a number of
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
references throughout statute we've gone
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
on there we've got this all over the
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
place yeah
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
my question though is that i asked
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
senator waters this
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
you have a student at holderness school
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
or kimball union
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
which is a non-public school that does
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
not reside in this state
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
but the way that's written i'm not so
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure now that they couldn't say hey we
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
want to get that 150 bucks for this kid
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in this concurrent
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right however at this
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
point they don't offer any of those
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
courses but they could yeah but we would
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
support i think uh senator waters
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned a new hampshire resident i
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
mean that i think would make a lot of
 
03:34:24.319 --> 03:34:26.229 align:start position:0%
mean that i think would make a lot of
sense

03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%

03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
no okay so the one that was on the table
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
i noticed for some reason didn't have
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note the department did
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
provide the fiscal note the senate in
 
03:35:41.279 --> 03:35:42.710 align:start position:0%
provide the fiscal note the senate in
december

03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
december
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
well let's make sure everybody's sitting
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
down here i'm ready to go
 
03:36:45.190 --> 03:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay you ready
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so if i read the bill
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
right or understood what um mr bossy
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
said previous this is a this is an
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing grant correct and it so it will
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
be included in the budget
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the money will come from the
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the education trust
 
03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
what if there's not enough money
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm fed if the education trust fund
 
03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough revenue to pay for
 
03:37:20.229 --> 03:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
all the expenditures and subsidized by
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund there has been many
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
times in the past there has not been
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
enough funding in the education trust
 
03:37:26.710 --> 03:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
fund in the past and the education the
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
general fund has subsidized it in the
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
last several years the education trust
 
03:37:33.190 --> 03:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
fund the revenues have done very well
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore as a result we have not
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
needed a transfer but the assumption of
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
that transfer would um cover this
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
can i have further yes yeah i don't mean
 
03:37:45.190 --> 03:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
to be what they call a debbie downer but
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have been through times where the i'm
 
03:37:48.319 --> 03:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
we have been through times where the i'm
sorry

03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll be a margie diamond then and then
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
um there have been times in the recent
 
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
past where the revenues of this i mean
 
03:37:59.190 --> 03:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
right now we're doing very well but
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
there have been times when revenues are
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
very low and it's caused the budget to
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate other sources of revenue to
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
towns and cities and school districts
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
that they had been giving prior
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
but that's not going to happen with this
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is permanent until the day i die
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
not nothing is permanent um actually the
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
people that have the ability to make
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
something not permanent in this room um
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
as a as of right now the way this is
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
written it would be an ongoing um grant
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
that would uh continue on um
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
if there was not enough revenue to cover
 
03:38:36.790 --> 03:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
the adequate education so one thing is
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
is this is putting it into the adequate
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
education grants which is a part of the
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
formula the first part is the statutory
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
piece that we are constitutionally
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
required to provide and then there are
 
03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
several other grants that are in that is
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the adequate education funding
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
formula um the fiscal capacity grants
 
03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
this extraordinary greed need grant the
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
and the stabilization grant those are
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
the other three pieces of that um
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
that entire amount equals adequate
 
03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
education grant and then um we are
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to pay for that
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
entire amount regardless of the revenue
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
and regardless of the appropriation so
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough appropriation to
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
pay for it we also are able to draw a
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
warrant and pay that require that
 
03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:21.429 align:start position:0%
warrant and pay that require that
obligation

03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
the state also promised um
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
large portions of the uh rooms and meals
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
taxes to communities um like 40
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
originally was the
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
the thing that wasn't going to go away
 
03:39:35.760 --> 03:39:36.389 align:start position:0%
the thing that wasn't going to go away
and

03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to do that
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
in many many many years if ever
 
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
um because it was always ch it's changed
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget process
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
would this be changeable in the budget
 
03:39:49.359 --> 03:39:51.110 align:start position:0%
would this be changeable in the budget
process

03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm saying is you know if
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to say to towns and cities
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to get this forever and
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're thinking they're going
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
to get it forever and they may plan
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
their budgets on getting it forever and
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
then suddenly it's not there anymore
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an increased burden
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
on property taxes or cause uh cause
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh schools to uh to have to do what they
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to do to cut their
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
their program so i'm i'm just trying to
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
find out is
 
03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
this forever um
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
that question actually should be to your
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues in your in this room not
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
myself i do want to say in the 13 years
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
i've been at the department of education
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
so through seven biennium budgets the
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education funding formula and
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
the grants associated with that have
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
been changed in almost every single
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
biennium budget process and sometimes
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
outside that process so it would not be
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
atypical for a change to be made either
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
to increase or decrease amounts of
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes margie finance can take it away
 
03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
yes margie finance can take it away
yes

03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:59.189 align:start position:0%
yes
absolutely

03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock thank you chairman
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
um could you give me the layman's
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
explanation that's all i need uh of two
 
03:41:06.239 --> 03:41:07.189 align:start position:0%
explanation that's all i need uh of two
towns

03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
on your chat
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
all right alexandria
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
so um the reason being that that
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
alexandria and alton wouldn't receive
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
any additional grants is because let's
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
see let me look at the calculation
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
um well i didn't care about them
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
particularly just like using that from
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
money to no money and no money right so
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
the um the formula requires you to have
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
a six million dollars of equalized
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
valuation for per
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch student in the
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
town okay so i'm going to look up
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
of course my computer has now locked
 
03:41:45.040 --> 03:42:08.229 align:start position:0%
of course my computer has now locked
itself

03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
so alton for example has a 16 million
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
dollar equalized valuation per free and
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch resident in the town um so
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
they would not be eligible for a grant
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
in either year um either year okay and i
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
just want to i do want to point out that
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
either year um
 
03:42:30.150 --> 03:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
very much an estimate uh 23 is an
 
03:42:33.030 --> 03:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
estimate 24 is even more of an estimate
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
because that's okay i'm just trying to
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
figure out and um so alexandria
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
is estimated to have an equalized
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
valuation of 5.9 million dollars or yeah
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
5.9 million dollars in fiscal year 23
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
per student
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
and in 24 alexandria is estimated to
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
have an 18 or an 8.1 million dollars
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
therefore would not be eligible to
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
receive the grant because it's over six
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars per student now i do
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
want to point out two things because you
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
see obviously a substantially lower
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
amount in 22 um than you would receive
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in 23 than you do in 24. and
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
the reason being here is because 23
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
there is a free and reduced lunch hold
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
harmless in the formula and in 24 as of
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
right now that has not been amended in
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
so as we
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
maybe just to draw people's memories
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
because it's been a little bit since
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
we've had an adequacy hearing in this
 
03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:40.469 align:start position:0%
we've had an adequacy hearing in this
room

03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture had
 
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
waivers for free and reduced lunch
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
meals and then as a result school
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
districts have had challenges receiving
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
the applications back
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
as such
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 2022 of the budget
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 it
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
allowed us to use the previous years
 
03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
sorry two previous years like prior to
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemics free and reduced lunch
 
03:44:06.309 --> 03:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
numbers um so that hold harmless
 
03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
was in for 22 and 23 there's a similar
 
03:44:12.750 --> 03:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
hold harmless which had us look at the
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic ratio of free and reduced
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
lunch kids in a school district and use
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
that ratio um to apply to the current
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment so if you had 25 free and
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch kids before the pandemic
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then during the pandemic you only
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
have 18 percent we actually use that 25
 
03:44:34.150 --> 03:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
percent and 23. so you're seeing that
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
number coming through in the 23 number
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
which is is
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
driving a higher grant amount in 24 for
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
the estimate we use the actual free and
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch numbers because as of
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
right now that 23 hold harmless expires
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the um in hb2
 
03:44:51.600 --> 03:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
in the um in hb2
okay

03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
i know that was not a super election
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i appreciate the the
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
detail on my uh layman's term i hate the
 
03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
hell of a detailed detail but no thank
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
you appreciate it
 
03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
represent cornell
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
question instead of using the whole
 
03:45:08.950 --> 03:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
harmless free and reduced lunch did you
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
think of using the medicaid number like
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
we changed
 
03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
so um i believe there is a bill that's
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
working its way through the legislature
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
i think the hearing is tomorrow morning
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
to potentially do that that likely will
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
go into effect i believe it's in fiscal
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
year 24. that does require us right now
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
um that bill is actually only requiring
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
us to
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
to submit an application to the us
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
department of education we then have to
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
be selected so i'm not sure if we're
 
03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to be selected for that but we
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
if that happens you'd use that number
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
for this too so if that happens those
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
kids that are medicaid eligible right
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
now become automatically eligible for
 
03:45:53.110 --> 03:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch so it would have
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
a higher free and reduced lunch a number
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
in this formula including those medicaid
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
kids right now the free and reduced
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
lunch number only includes kids whose
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
parents have either filled out the
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
application or participating in snap wic
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you how does this um apply to
 
03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
it does not apply to charter schools
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
further questions represent luno
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair actually could i make
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
just sort of a comment
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i know this isn't um uh you know
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
deliberation here
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
what we have here we have an early bill
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we're gonna have to maximize
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
on uh all our time on this bill
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
this right here
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
is information which has amendments for
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
this bill which i was going to speak to
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
after all this and and and that's good
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
and and and i think and i think my
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
comments sort of i haven't seen these
 
03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendments but but but i think my
 
03:46:58.950 --> 03:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
comments sort of go along the lines of
 
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
this i'm looking particularly at
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
manchester um
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
because it clearly gets uh gets almost
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
nearly four million dollars in the first
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
year of this which is which is not an
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
insignificant amount of money um and uh
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and for the for the manchester
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
school district i think every uh every
 
03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
penny counts but to put that in context
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
when you're um when you've got about
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
four million dollars and and you're
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
educating approximately thirteen
 
03:47:25.680 --> 03:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
educating approximately thirteen
thousand

03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
03:47:28.710 --> 03:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
students this comes out to about three
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per student um in
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
increased state grant support and i want
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
to put that i want to sort of juxtapose
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
that with what the with what the school
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
funding commission uh found
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh last year which is um manchester
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
spends about the lease or budgets about
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
the least amount
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
per student for uh for public education
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
just about just a little over 12 um
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars so twelve hundred
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars i'm sorry twelve thousand
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
dollars per student the um uh state
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
average is certainly a lot higher than
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that and for manchester at least based
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
on our our um our expert analysis
 
03:48:12.150 --> 03:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
um in order for manchester's average
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
student to perform at state average
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
would uh would would cost um
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
closer to twenty one thousand dollars
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
per student so up from twelve thousand
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
to twenty one thousand dollars three
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars gets us puts us in the
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
right direction but it doesn't it
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't really move the needle
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
and um and i hope that we'll be able i
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
hope that this committee will be able to
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh to recommend amendments that do start
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
to move the needle um maybe not as far
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
as as a
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
redesigned funding
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
plan and we do have an interim study
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
to look at that but um but i think given
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
given what we've certainly heard on this
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
bill and on other bills the with uh with
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
state revenues where they are that that
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
we do something to move the needle for
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
our school districts but in particular
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
districts like like manchester and
 
03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
districts like like manchester and
newport

03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
newport
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative very
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you this money that comes
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
in is not limited to um it can be used
 
03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
for any anything within the district is
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
that right correct
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just debating whether i should go
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
find uh do a pink car to hand all this
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
stuff out
 
03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:32.309 align:start position:0%
stuff out
um

03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:34.229 --> 03:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
but i do have some
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
concerns this bill was given to us it
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
came to our committee
 
03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:40.150 align:start position:0%
came to our committee
on

03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
not this past friday but the friday past
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
that just you know so we've had it about
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
a week
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
it came in and we recognized it was an
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
early bill
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
and we had about three days to get it
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
scheduled so we could have a hearing and
 
03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
execute and get it out by the 14th
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
really basically by the 13th
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is wednesday
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
and so in looking at it it has a lot of
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
financial repercussions
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
and and possibilities in terms of our
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
working on and i have some materials
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
here and i think what i'll do is i'll
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
fill a pink card out so i can present
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
this stuff and discuss it because we're
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
just running out of time here
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so let me fill out one of
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
these pink cards here or or at least do
 
03:50:25.359 --> 03:50:27.910 align:start position:0%
these pink cards here or or at least do
it

03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman lad
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to be troublesome at all
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
i if this is the policy commission the
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
committee and the finances the finance
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
committee is this relevant to our
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee and and i don't know the
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that that's a that's an honest
 
03:50:46.080 --> 03:51:03.110 align:start position:0%
answer to that that's a that's an honest
question

03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%

that's not part of it
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay what i've done is i've looked at
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
the education funding bill which we had
 
03:57:38.469 --> 03:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
presented to us by senator hennessey's
 
03:57:38.479 --> 03:57:39.670 align:start position:0%
presented to us by senator hennessey's
office

03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and and the sponsors of that bill
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
we've seen that bill before or that
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
concept before many many a time
 
03:57:49.670 --> 03:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with the ratcheting down from
 
03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:50.389 align:start position:0%
dealing with the ratcheting down from
the

03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
the six
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
million dollar mark down to the lower
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
property valuations in terms of funding
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
students we have seen this before
 
03:57:59.439 --> 03:58:00.469 align:start position:0%
students we have seen this before
um

03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
as a as uh came out they originally came
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
out of the task force back in
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
that karen umberger had back in 2018 i
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we're we're looking
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
at grants today out in the public
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
schools one of the areas that i'm very
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
very concerned about have been concerned
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
about for years
 
03:58:26.150 --> 03:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
is the funding of differentiated
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for special
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
education and how that impacts
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
policy-wise in the districts
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have one way of doing it right now
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually we have a hybrid if you were
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the sheet that i gave you
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
from the education commission in the
 
03:58:42.479 --> 03:58:43.590 align:start position:0%
from the education commission in the
states

03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
that sheet shows you how various states
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
fund special education there's there's
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
some different models in there
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
some give varying level of weighted
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
funding for various categories of
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
special education
 
03:59:01.750 --> 03:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have 13 categories that are reported
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on the sheet right here
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
i just grabbed one of my i could have
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
grabbed 2020 i'd grab 2019 and made a
 
03:59:12.150 --> 03:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
copy of that they all report the same 13
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
type categories
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it shows the number of students that
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
are in these categories throughout the
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
state the numbers and our number comes
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
up total special education handicapping
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
areas ieps a little over 30 000 kids in
 
03:59:26.560 --> 03:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
areas ieps a little over 30 000 kids in
2019

03:59:28.150 --> 03:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
2019
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's very similar
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
for 2020 and if you went back 10 12
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
years it was right around 29 000 and
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
we're in the same ballpark we haven't
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
diverged a whole lot from that even
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
though our demographic has gone down in
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
terms of our students a total student
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
population we've seen that
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
special ed service area pretty much as a
 
03:59:49.600 --> 03:59:50.630 align:start position:0%
special ed service area pretty much as a
constant

03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
constant
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the 30 000 mark
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
so that shows you the various categories
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
right there starting with autism and
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
then going down the visual impairments
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
my experience as a school principal
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and uh administrator have been that
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
there are a number of handicapping
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
conditions out there in our schools
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
which take a lot more support a lot more
 
04:00:13.439 --> 04:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
which take a lot more support a lot more
time

04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
and a lot more funding to support than
 
04:00:17.199 --> 04:00:18.150 align:start position:0%
and a lot more funding to support than
others

04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we all know that there's some
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
students that might receive special
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
education iep support in the area speech
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
pathology speech services therapy which
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
may only amount to a half hour a week
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
but we also know that there are some
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
other students which require a whole lot
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
more development in terms of speech that
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
could be a lot longer than that but the
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
majority are not as long as a student
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that might have autism or a student that
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
might be tbi or a student that might
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
have orthopedic handicap which is more
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
costly and requires a lot more time
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
often than the student that's receiving
 
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
speech services
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the lower elementary grades
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
especially in trying to start developing
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
their articulation the way that we'd
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
like to see the child be at
 
04:01:07.510 --> 04:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
so the costs different they're different
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
and from one handicapping area to
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
another you can see that in some of the
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
the sheets that come from various states
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the education commission estates they
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
may have at least six or seven different
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
categories in some cases we have a
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
hybrid in this state we have one one
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
funding amount for differentiated aid in
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
special education that's 2 000 plus
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
dollars uh there's a sheet which i have
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
that i made for you that shows that it's
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
this sheet right here
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you can see that you know our base
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
cost is identified
 
04:01:40.800 --> 04:01:41.750 align:start position:0%
cost is identified
but

04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
the special ed cost for
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
students is two thousand thirty seven
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
dollars eleven seven cents that's
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
projected for fy23
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's our estimated cost for fy23
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's the amount which we'll be using
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
in the funding is every student that has
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
an iep will receive that type of dollar
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
we also have a hybrid model in the state
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
where we do fund uh those students which
 
04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
have a handicapping condition which
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
requires more than three and a half
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
times the base cost up to 80 percent to
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
the to 10 times and then it's funded
 
04:02:16.640 --> 04:02:17.910 align:start position:0%
the to 10 times and then it's funded
fully

04:02:17.910 --> 04:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
fully
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's a hybrid model so we have two
 
04:02:22.389 --> 04:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
ways of funding special education in
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
this state
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
whereas many other states have prior to
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
getting that hybrid model that the
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
heavy weighted amount for the student is
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the cat aid category
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's other differing weights provided
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to look at and trying to
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
break that out somehow and it's very
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
difficult in the state seeing that the
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
material even though it's provided by
 
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
the individual school districts on this
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
district-wide basis in reported doe and
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
you can see that on the forms which i
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
provided you on the areas of one through
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
three in category a you'll see
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
developmental delay specific learning
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
disability speech or language
 
04:03:05.120 --> 04:03:06.469 align:start position:0%
disability speech or language
impairments

04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
impairments
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's an area which generally speaking
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
does not cost as much as those 10 areas
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
down below
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
so what i'm proposing is that we address
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
the three areas in category 8
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
funding the way they're being funded
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
currently in differentiated aid
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
however recognizing that the costs
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
associated with the groups
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
areas in category b
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
will cost more and do cost more
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
so in category b
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
or category a
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at our total amount we do
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
for base adequacy
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we provide out of
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
base adequacy for the differentiated aid
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
right now is about 54 percent of the
 
04:03:56.429 --> 04:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
base cost or
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
2037.11 cents
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm proposing for the areas in
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
category b autism down through traumatic
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
brain injury and
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
visual impairments
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
the cost would be
 
04:04:11.680 --> 04:04:13.030 align:start position:0%
the cost would be
89

04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
89
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the base or 3 367
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
8 cents
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's approximately
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
500 more than what we're doing right now
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
in translating that to what the total
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
costs we would be adding into our budget
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
it comes out to exactly the same amount
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.800 --> 04:04:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
educational

04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
educational
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant would require
 
04:04:40.880 --> 04:04:42.790 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant would require
14.7

04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
14.7
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
14 point something million dollars
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
this increases that our budget by
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
another 14 point something million
 
04:04:50.319 --> 04:04:51.349 align:start position:0%
another 14 point something million
dollars

04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
if we follow through and do it with the
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
two categories a and b
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have that if don't have
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
that information and in my communication
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the department it can be gotten
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
then we could fund at a different level
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
and raise the amount of money which
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're funding for differentiated aid by
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
funding at a like a 0.67
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the base
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
if in funding at 0.67 you can see how
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
that would stack up in regard to what
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
your districts are getting right now
 
04:05:27.189 --> 04:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
for example um
 
04:05:27.199 --> 04:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
for example um
litchfield

04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
which has
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
227.08 students qualifying for special
 
04:05:32.880 --> 04:05:34.550 align:start position:0%
227.08 students qualifying for special
education

04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
the current funding formula provides 462
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
000 some odd dollars
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
to that district
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
this funding formula would provide 576
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
and you can go down and wade through and
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
see how it affects the various districts
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
04:05:54.150 --> 04:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
so what i'm proposing this is one
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that you will see as i'm
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
trying to increase the funding for
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid special education
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
04:06:04.950 --> 04:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
two categories it actually only
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
increases those
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
ieps or those handicapping conditions in
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
category b everything else just remains
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
the same it is in in those other three
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
iep areas in category a
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
the second thing i i'm adding in as an
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
when we have grant monies see the
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid right here is a part
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
of the constitutional requirement your
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
base cost and your differentiated aid
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
are constitutionally required every
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
student gets the same amount of money
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of the wealth of the
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
community or the poverty of the
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
community when we start talking grant
 
04:06:41.359 --> 04:06:42.389 align:start position:0%
community when we start talking grant
money

04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
and stabilization you start going
 
04:06:46.630 --> 04:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
outside that constitutional requirement
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
and you get into the fact that now a
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
district that maybe doesn't have the
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
high property values is entitled to some
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid or you're
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to a extraordinary grant need
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
program need grant program
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
that can change that can change however
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
the differentiated aid
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
goes up it doesn't get wiped out it's
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
part of the formula for the
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement which we have
 
04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
a conval case right in front of us right
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
now which we should all be aware of
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to be looking at
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
when i was on the funding commission for
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half that was
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
roughly about a year and a half ago dave
 
04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
i can remember we discussed this and i
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
had concerns i said i like the idea of
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding special education and using
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
weights i'm not necessarily supportive
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
though of funding especially at one
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
increased total weight and i understand
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
it there's a lot more to the whole
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
funding formula at a level of 4.29 times
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
that that six thousand five hundred and
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
one dollars
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
i am supported though and rec and do
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
recognize that our policy right now as
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
we have it does not recognize in the
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
funding that follows our policy
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not properly funding all
 
04:08:07.110 --> 04:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
special ed the way we should in our
 
04:08:07.120 --> 04:08:08.630 align:start position:0%
special ed the way we should in our
state

04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to propose that we look at
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
that in terms of that first amendment
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
the second amendment though i have and i
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
was just about ready to speak to
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
deals with accountability for the grant
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
you can write in accountability to
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
districts for grant money if you're
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
going to receive these grants there's
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
some accountability you have to ensure
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
that your your program that you're going
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
to use to try and see this achievement
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
and growth is approved by the department
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
of education and you can be required
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
also to
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
submit annual reports
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
to so showing that you are demonstrating
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
some growth or some gain for the areas
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
identifying or receiving that grant
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
money in
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
none of that grant money none of the
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
money provide can actually has to be
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
targeted that's the the point targeted
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
towards a specific area within our
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
my intent in the second amendment is
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
that there be some accountability for
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
the education needs grant program you
 
04:09:11.590 --> 04:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
can see that in that
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that amending language is an
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
exact extrapolation from the report that
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
came out in
 
04:09:22.229 --> 04:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
2018 from the umberger study
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the last amendment is an amendment which
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
would combine both the two first two
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendments into one if in case
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
this were to move forward
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm presenting it primarily because i
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
want to open up the policy discussion
 
04:09:37.439 --> 04:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
want to open up the policy discussion
regarding

04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
where special education is going
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
special education as alluded to at the
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
very beginning of the meeting we have
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
roughly meeting we had about 30 000 kids
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
in that program right now
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
our demographics going down our special
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
education is basically not
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the costs are increasing all the
 
04:09:57.520 --> 04:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
and the costs are increasing all the
time

04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
and yet we know we have to provide these
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
stellar children the services they
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
deserve when i talked to superintendent
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
of schools in my district i asked the
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
other day about roughly five days ago
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
where are we going with special
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
education services she responded to me
 
04:10:15.600 --> 04:10:16.389 align:start position:0%
education services she responded to me
that

04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
the other health impaired category
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
is going off the charts in sau 23
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of its result of the pandemic
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
and kids not having the opportunity to
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
be eyeballed eyeball with their teacher
 
04:10:31.760 --> 04:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
be eyeballed eyeball with their teacher
and

04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:32.800 --> 04:10:33.670 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
developing a number of health
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
impairments associated what they have
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
gone through they've been traumatized
 
04:10:39.040 --> 04:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
gone through they've been traumatized
so

04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i offer these materials
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
for you to
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
consider to think about and when we come
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
back on wednesday
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
we can address it further in that formal
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
process thank you
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um uh representative
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli mr chair and thank you rick for
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
um bringing um bringing these these
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
forward and i think we'll probably have
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
a a very robust discussion on these um
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
on wednesday for sure and i think this
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
is certainly an area that deserves um
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
robust discussion
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that that i liked
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
ab about senate bill 420 as it was
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
brought to us
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's you know something
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's at least something and and um but
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
it does it in a way that i that i it
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
applies that 14 million dollars
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
using two
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
essentially two factors access to
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
resources and and the end and poverty
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
and so so it does it through that
 
04:11:47.830 --> 04:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat complex formula of of equalized
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
valuation divided by the number of
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
students that are that are uh enrolled
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
in free and reduced uh price lunch
 
04:11:54.479 --> 04:11:55.349 align:start position:0%
in free and reduced uh price lunch
program

04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
so so it i i think it's a very
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
interesting way approach and and it and
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
it addresses through you know that 14
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
um using those two very important um you
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
know factors
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh i've only really had a chance um uh
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
to look at uh your amendment 1380 as i
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
think you spoke to sort of that
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
um in in greater detail and um
 
04:12:23.760 --> 04:12:24.710 align:start position:0%
um in in greater detail and um
and

04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:29.110 --> 04:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
my my
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
i guess only criticism on 1380 is that
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
it it it fails to what while it
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
certainly looks at it doesn't look at
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
at poverty so much as it looks at
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
costs associated with special education
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
but it fails to consider
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the access to resources and you can
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
see that's borne out in your um in the
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that you did with the with
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
the towns that i think several of us
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know represent and i want to pick on
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
manchester again because i like picking
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
on manchester uh because it's clearly a
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
a standout in the state in a number of
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
different ways but um
 
04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
but what uh what six what
 
04:13:15.040 --> 04:13:15.830 align:start position:0%
but what uh what six what
what

04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
um what 420 as as
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
introduced to us
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
um does for manchester is increases the
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
state grant to manchester
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
by four almost four million dollars in
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
04:13:29.840 --> 04:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
the first year
what

04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
amendment 1380 does for manchester
 
04:13:37.030 --> 04:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
is increases manchester's grant in the
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
first year by only 1.3 million dollars
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
not by four million dollars um and
 
04:13:42.319 --> 04:13:43.189 align:start position:0%
not by four million dollars um and
that's

04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know that's shown that's the
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
difference between the the six point
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
three million dollars is calculated in
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment minus the five million
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
dollars that it currently gets under the
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
under the
 
04:13:55.680 --> 04:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
under the
um

04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
the special education portion of its of
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
its uh adequate education grant so it's
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
only a 1.3 million dollar increase
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh and it's and and it's and that's
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
happening because
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
because access to resources is not being
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh being considered in um in amendment
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
1380 so that in fact every school
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
district that has even one special
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
education student is going to be getting
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
an increased grant from the state
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
whether they need whether they need it
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
or not newcastle is going to get an
 
04:14:28.319 --> 04:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
or not newcastle is going to get an
increase

04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:14:29.279 --> 04:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
increase
um

04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
whether they need it or not
 
04:14:32.560 --> 04:14:34.149 align:start position:0%
whether they need it or not
and

04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
and and i think in in
 
04:14:36.640 --> 04:14:39.510 align:start position:0%
and and i think in in
in

04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
04:14:41.199 --> 04:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
um

04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh where where we have
 
04:14:44.479 --> 04:14:45.670 align:start position:0%
uh where where we have
um

04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
failed to provide
 
04:14:49.110 --> 04:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
adequate funding
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
tends to be in the dec in the districts
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that don't have access towards to
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
the resources they need
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and and i i i have to you know
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
applaud you rick because
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're all trying to work
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
on on ways to improve
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
education funding um but um but 420 is
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
as senator hennessey has brought it
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't put a lot of money onto
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
it but it is directing it to where it's
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
needed most
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
and um and there's you've put a lot of
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
material uh here on this and you've
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
worked i mean this is a lot of work rick
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and we don't have a lot of time to
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
get uh to get through it um but uh but
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to get to working
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
through the other amendments that you've
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward as well
 
04:15:39.040 --> 04:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
brought forward as well
um

04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i just hope members of of this
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee will uh will consider
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
that 14 million dollars and this goes
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
right to mary beth's question it's a
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
policy question um it's not the total
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money but it's how it's being
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
used and uh and i hope members of this
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee will uh will will look to
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
directing it to where it's
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
where it's needed um uh most
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
as being a um as being a policy goal
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you no question yeah i know
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's no question there and you know
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's more informational what i'm
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
trying to provide here
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:16:17.600 --> 04:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
is that
um

04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
it is policy to me in the fact that
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing under differentiated
 
04:16:25.199 --> 04:16:26.070 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing under differentiated
aid

04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
aid
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
that special education services
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
are an area that every child deserves
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
support in every child
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
and if you go back to the claremont
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
decision i believe it's back in 1994
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
thereabouts the one of the first ones
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
which we had there if you look in law
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
it also
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
addresses this issue that we are
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
required to provide this type of support
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
for all students and followed up by the
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
londonderry decision a little later that
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
poverty and
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
wealth of the community should not
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
impact what we believe is a necessary
 
04:17:02.960 --> 04:17:04.389 align:start position:0%
impact what we believe is a necessary
service

04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:17:05.590 --> 04:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the only way we're going to get a
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
service is so we can afford to provide
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
the service so in order to make sure
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
your policy is followed out and so i
 
04:17:14.070 --> 04:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
can't divorce costing and policy from
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
each other they're both very related
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to be providing these
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
very costly services today we've spoken
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
about a lot of special ed areas and we
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
are talking about services which are off
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
the charts in terms of
 
04:17:32.309 --> 04:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
of of school districts being able to
 
04:17:32.319 --> 04:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
of of school districts being able to
provide

04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
this right here is this amendment that
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing forward
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
is not subtracting from what has been
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
done in terms of directing poverty money
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
to areas that have the poverty the 14
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
plus million dollars that
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey's brought forward it's
 
04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
adding to it and saying yes we are all
 
04:17:55.830 --> 04:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to add another 14 million so it
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
comes out roughly around 30 million
 
04:17:57.359 --> 04:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
comes out roughly around 30 million
dollars

04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
to our funding for education to support
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
the policies
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
need to be conducting or administering
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
and following through on in special
 
04:18:10.319 --> 04:18:11.670 align:start position:0%
and following through on in special
education

04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we have these 13 categorical areas
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
right here we know that they cost more
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
than what we're providing
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the funding commission saw that in fact
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
the idea was to weight it at 4.29 i'm
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
waiting here at what point eight
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
something of the base
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is a significant amount that's
 
04:18:34.080 --> 04:18:35.030 align:start position:0%
which is a significant amount that's
less

04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
but it's it's working to provide that
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
support for all children now if you look
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
at the vote that came out of the senate
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
in 420
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
there was one vote which was
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
oppositional to it the reason why
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in it for my towns
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
the money that's going out in 420 is for
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
poverty areas right
 
04:18:56.080 --> 04:18:57.030 align:start position:0%
poverty areas right
the

04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the community the senator that spoke out
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
said and spoke out quite elegantly is
 
04:19:02.000 --> 04:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
said and spoke out quite elegantly is
that

04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
yes it's good but it doesn't provide
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
anything for my community
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for their students in
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
every one of these communities and
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
everything whether you're from
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
tuftonboro or you're from haverhill two
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
very different or hopkinton very
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
assessed property values and being able
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
to provide the funds needed to support
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
their programs
 
04:19:31.349 --> 04:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
i believe that every student deserves
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
that opportunity regard regardless as
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
the court case says
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of your wealth
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
or your poverty
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why i've also decided
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps we need to be looking at
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's an area which we haven't touched
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
since i've been on the in the house
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's 14 years
 
04:19:54.550 --> 04:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's time to really be analyzing yeah we
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
have a cola we increase it somewhat
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
but we haven't made a significant change
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
at all to it and yet we know that we're
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
not able to provide all these services
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
without taking money out of other areas
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
and of our operational budgets in the
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
districts that is occurring to support
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
special ed so that's why i bring it
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
forward so we can have an honest
 
04:20:15.359 --> 04:20:16.630 align:start position:0%
forward so we can have an honest
discussion

04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
look at it you know i can go anyway on
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
this this does you know however i think
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's time that as a education committee
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
we have this discussion as a whole
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair did you want to uh continue
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh with questions now or
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
let us chew on this until uh our session
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
on wednesday and well let's delve deeper
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's a lot past lunch i don't think we
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
should be taking a whole lot more time
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
today real quick
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah uh thanks so do these do these
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
amendments build on each other
 
04:20:48.159 --> 04:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
amendments build on each other
no

04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
no well one does the final one
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
includes there's two amendments one has
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
grant accountability in it okay that's
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
the one that comes out of that previous
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
task force yep and then the other one
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
deals with the
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
special education additional aid it
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
speaks to it's a simple amendment which
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
adds in under differentiated aid two
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
brackets category a category b and it
 
04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
sets the funding amount for category a
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
and category b
 
04:21:17.040 --> 04:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
and category b
the

04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
funding those iep conditions listed
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
there are the same conditions which are
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
used by the department and you're having
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
to respond to the department as a
 
04:21:27.199 --> 04:21:28.149 align:start position:0%
to respond to the department as a
district

04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
how many kids are in each one of those
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
categorical areas
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing changed there from
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
what we're doing it's it's primarily a
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
change in terms of
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
how we're funding
 
04:21:42.389 --> 04:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
as mary beth said how we're funding the
 
04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
question at the beginning the and
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
costing out these these uh services for
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh special education so is it a
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
possibility that someone would would
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
would um support all three amendments
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's possible
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
but they're so yeah
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's possible yeah you could you know
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
the the the amendments the last
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
amendment would be just amending the
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill with you know everything that we're
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
talking about right so
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
so amendment 1384
 
04:22:10.720 --> 04:22:12.229 align:start position:0%
so amendment 1384
combines

04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
combines
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 1420
 
04:22:14.720 --> 04:22:16.870 align:start position:0%
senate bill 1420
with

04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.880 --> 04:22:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:22:26.309 --> 04:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
the senator used to be that was here our
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
senate representative used to be on the
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh from where they had always a stack of
 
04:22:35.110 --> 04:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendments sitting beside him when
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're in exact session and that one
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
didn't work so i'll go to this one this
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
one and finally work through their
 
04:22:40.399 --> 04:22:45.429 align:start position:0%
one and finally work through their
amendments

04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
another quick question or uh do you want
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
to hold that to wednesday
 
04:22:50.159 --> 04:22:51.910 align:start position:0%
to hold that to wednesday
okay

04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
technically the hearing is still open
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
we are talking about uh thank you for
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
we are talking about grant money
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
that is being provided by the state or
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
federal grant money
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
that is coming into the state we're
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
talking about money that's appropriated
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
by the state of new hampshire okay
