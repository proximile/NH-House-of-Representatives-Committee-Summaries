everybody we have a full day of activity
 
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
and before we get started I'll ask
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
everyone to rise and join representative

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you everybody we're going
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
to have three public hearings this
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
morning the first one is a
 
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
continuation of a public hearing that we
 
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
recessed last week that's House Bill 567
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
FN relative to the elimination of useful
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
classes we'll then move to a public
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 674 FN relative to
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
nonwire Alternatives time of you tar
 
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
time of use tariffs and multi-year rate
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
settings and then wrap up the morning
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
activity with a public hearing on
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
establishing a
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide online energy data
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
platform at 1:00 this afternoon we will
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
have an executive SE excession session
 
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
on five bills and then after the
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
executive session we will have public
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
hearings on three additional bills so
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's a full and busy day here
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
today so I'm going to now open the
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.390 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing on House Bill
567

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
FN and because we
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
recessed this public hearing last year
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
or last week rather we have 11 pink
 
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.670 align:start position:0%
or last week rather we have 11 pink
cards

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
cards
 
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
from last week so we're going to go
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
through those first I have a bunch of
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
pink cards that were submitted this
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
morning I suspect some of them are dupes
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
but we'll go through what we have here
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
first and then we will move on look at
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
the dupes and see if there's the
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
duplicates and see if there's
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
any need to call up anybody
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
else so that is a nice refresher for
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
everybody if you want want to testify on
 
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
a bill you must submit a pink card so do
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
so as soon as possible we have another
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
new innovation here this morning and
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
that is on the right hand side of the
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
table that we use for people to testify
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
before the committee there is now a
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
placard I suppose the people in the back
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
of the room can't see it but we can see
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
it and people looking uh watching from
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
home will be able to see it on the
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
camera it says now hearing and then it
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
lists the name of the bill HB 567 FN
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's a stack of papers on the edge of
 
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
that table that has the numbers of all
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
the bills that we be hearing today and
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask for a volunteer from
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to change that
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
plard uh representative Matson has
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
volunteered to do that Duty so once we
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
finish one public hearing and move to
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing I'll ask you if
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
you could change that placard please so
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
with that now we'll continue this public
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm going to call First on
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington to sort of
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill and at least uh
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
refresh our memory about its contents so
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
up Mr thank you Mr chairman um I look at
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
this this useful thermal energy as one
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the worst examples of government that
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
we have it is just favoritism for a
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
small group who decided rather than
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
spend their time time and effort selling
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
their product based on its merits they
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
decided to come to conquer and spend
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
their time and effort on lobbying to get
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
a law passed so they could be subsidized
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy has absolutely
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electricity there's
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
nobody out there that's saying boy I
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
have electric baseboard heating and I'm
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to put in a wood chip boiler so I
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
can get useful thermal energy no they're
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
converting from maybe natural gas or oil
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
natural gas would would be but maybe a
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
95% efficiency if it's a condensing more
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
natural gas furnace to a wood chip
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
boiler which is a lot lower efficiency
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
but the fact is it's got nothing to do
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
with electricity and why we bury this in
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
the electric rates is still I find it
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
amazing if you were to PLL let's say
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
10,000 people in New Hampshire and ask
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
them do you pay higher electric rates so
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
wood chip manufacturers can get a
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
subsidy from your electric bill I bet
 
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.350 align:start position:0%
subsidy from your electric bill I bet
you

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
99,999 would say I don't know what
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about why should I pay
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
higher electric bills to subsidize would
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
ship factories or why should I subsidize
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
I know there's a particular County that
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
has this so I would be open for some
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
grandfather uh Amendment because I'm
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
realistic and realize people aren't
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to vote against their own uh
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
what's good for their for their County
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains is that the
 
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
electric payers in my towns should not
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
be paying higher electric rates so that
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
some County pays lower uh because they
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
use wood chip they took advantage of the
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
situation I can understand why they did
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
that but that that's not my big problem
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
my big problem was the bill itself like
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
I said this is government and its worth
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
secret uh lobbying to get a subsidy
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
where nobody even knows it's being done
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
again ask your Co ask go around when you
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
you get home ask your constituents how
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
many of them realize they're paying a
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
higher electric bill and as soon as say
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
well it's only you know 50 cents or a
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollar or whatever it is but you know we
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a 50 cents here and 50 cents there
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
and a dollar there and a dollar there
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
and pretty soon you're talking real
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
money to kind of paraphrase ever durksen
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and that's the problem with this it's
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
got nothing to do with electricity uh if
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
you want to subsidize wood chips and
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
burning of wood chips then step up to
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
the plate and say I will pay I will
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
sponsor a tax on something else so that
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
we can subsidize wood chips but you
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
won't do that because oh no taxes are
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
bad so we hide it in the electric bill
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
like I say this is an example of
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
government at its worse and there's
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
nothing more to be said than
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
that any questions if there are some
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative McGee thank
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Mr Harrington
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um we heard it's
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
representative Harington representative
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington yes and you're still Mis as
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
well but
 
00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.550 align:start position:0%
well but
representative

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
um so we heard quite a bit of testimony
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
from folks who would be affected if we
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
passed uh this bill
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
and I've heard you make the this
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
argument that you've made this morning
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the past about the fact that it's not
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
electric energy but the can you tell us
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
what what R EC stands
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
for the Rex it's renewable energy
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
credits right so it it does qualify as
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
energy correct it it doesn't say
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
renewable electric credits I'm not
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
debating about what it qualifies what
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's whether it's energy or not my
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
question is what does it have to do with
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
electric rates it would be the same
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
thing as if you said okay let's put a
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
hidden fee on I don't know U your water
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill because we're going to subsidize
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
people who put up solar panels nothing
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
to do with solar panels nothing to do
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
with hiding it in your water bill but
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing here with
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
electric rates we're hiding it in here
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to step up to the
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
plate and say I think this is worthy and
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
I'll pass a tax on it we so again go
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
back ask your constituents make make a
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
thousand phone calls you will not get a
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
single person unless they're actually
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
getting subsidy that will say I'm paying
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
higher electric rates and I'm glad to do
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
it so subsidize W ship people followup
 
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.030 align:start position:0%
it so subsidize W ship people followup
follow

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
up um I I hear what you're saying um so
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy credit program
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
though is part of the state's overall
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
approach to the renewable portfolio
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
standards which Renewables include all
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
of the local sustainable energy that is
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
noncarbon emitting um and so
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
so you we're still trying to pull out of
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard just
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
you know one section of that standard
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
which was identified as beneficial for
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
the state which was why it was included
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the first place because it's a
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
resource that we have here and uh and
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
industries and jobs and all that go
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
along with it right that's what we keep
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony on is that well I
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
disagree with you on two on two points
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
first it wasn't in the original
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard it was
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
added some years
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
after a lot of lobbying by one
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
particular group so it wasn't in the
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
original bill it was an afterthought
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
they could sneak it in and uh get away
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
with charging people higher electric
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
rates and no one would know about it
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
second you mentioned carbon emitting
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
well obviously when you burn wood what
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
happens you give off carbon dioxide you
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
give up a lot of carbon dioxide in fact
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for the lobbying of the
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
wood people in New Hampshire it probably
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be considered renewable as in
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think you have to have a
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
thermal efficiency of uh 40% to qualify
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
for a half a wreck and I think it's 50%
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
to qualify for a full wreck which
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
obviously no wood burning plant makes so
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's that that assumption that
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's not uh emitting
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
carbon is wrong it does emit carbon
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
dioxide when you burn wood you give off
 
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.189 align:start position:0%
dioxide when you burn wood you give off
carbon

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
dioxide may may I clarify a point go
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:53.389 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
Harrington it was my understanding that
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
actually has to qualif ify plants um
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
that are you know receiving thermal
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
wrecks in terms of their emissions in
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
order for them to qualify for renewable
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
energy credits in terms of what they're
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
emitting is that is that accurate to
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
your understanding there are standards
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
but one of them is not carbon dioxide
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
because no nothing none of them would
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
meet that because when you burn wood you
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
give off carbon dioxide I mean you can't
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's an absolute byproduct you have
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
an option don't burn wood or give off
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide one or the
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
other further
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh just a
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
couple of things but uh conf you you're
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
saying trees give off carbon dioxide but
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
in growing trees consume carbon dioxide
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't have trees if they
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
didn't consume carbon dioxide so it
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
seemed to me
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
that trees would be or burning wood
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be part of a renewable cycle as
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
long as you didn't burn up all your wood
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and you did in a sustainable fashion so
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble with the notion that
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's bad to burn trees and almost
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
equally as bad as burning fossil fuels
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
which are not renewable as far as I know
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
are you saying so so it's remember we're
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
not here to debate we're here to ask
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
questions so it's clear that it was
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
intended here as a place to identify and
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
incen incentives for energy whether it's
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
electricity or thermal energy uh doing
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
that in the state with State resources
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to burning fossil fuels are
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
you saying you would rather get rid of
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
this incentive for a native capability
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
to generate electricity and you would
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
rather burn fossil
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
fuels well first of all your question is
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
sort of uh doesn't make a lot of sense
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
let me put it that way to start with if
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at options here you I
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
have a facility I can put in a
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
condensing natural gas fired uh furnace
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's going to be 95% efficient I don't
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
even have to have a chimney I can use a
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
plastic pipe because the waste heat is
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
so little or I can put in a wood chip
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
which is probably somewhere in the 25%
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
efficient range and as far as this
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
concept of with Native energy well we
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
don't have native cars should we have a
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
subsidy so we start building cars in New
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I know I don't think we
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
build any refrigerators in New Hampshire
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
so we this this concept of that we're
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
getting it from other parts of the
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
country is somehow bad because we export
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
a awful lot of products to the rest of
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
the country do we want them to shut us
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
off and say oh no no all of our
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
high-tech manufacturing that we do here
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
should be made in Michigan rather than
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
us selling them to people in Michigan so
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
it we can get native and they do the
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
same thing to us all that's going to do
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
is drive the price of everything
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket uh this this concept that
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
we're somehow not one country but
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
individual states that have to uh look
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
at how we do things it's that's a f i
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
mean it just doesn't make any sense so
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
follow okay no no followup this is
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
degenerating into a debate rather than a
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
question and answer session
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative rhos do you have a
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
question go ahead
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
actually know
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
the technical
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
specifications um of any of these
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
high-tech wood pellet boilers in terms
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
of combustion efficiency I mean you're
 
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:38.919 align:start position:0%
citing some figures and it seems like
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
you're just pulling them out of the air
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
do you actually know the technical
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
specifications of of the heat conversion
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
efficiency I I don't have an exact
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
number for that no okay thank you any
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none we'll next
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
call on Morton Bailey of the lime green
 
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.430 align:start position:0%
call on Morton Bailey of the lime green
Heat

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
Heat
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
of lime green heat whatever that
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
is Morton
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
available okay well next here

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Christensen has submitted
 
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Christensen has submitted
written

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
testifying next is Brook Brooks Peterson
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
energy I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
there okay next up is
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
Jim Van
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay how about Jason stuck I know he's
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
here from the New Hampshire Timber land
 
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.029 align:start position:0%
here from the New Hampshire Timber land
Owners

00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
Association and remember we don't need a
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
discussion of the wood industry we just
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
okay good good morning um for the record
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
Jason stock executive director of the
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
Association and uh I appreciate the
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and testify uh in
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to to this bill today to
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
567 last week um you got kind of a a
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
primer on the forest products industry
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
and kind of how low-grade wood markets
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
interact with the ability to manage
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
Timberland in the state but also how
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
they dovetail with all the sectors
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
within the state's Forest products
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
industry including solidwood which would
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
which includes Lumber um as well um
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 567 does more than just
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
modify the thermal the thermal wreck
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
portion of class one um and I don't want
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
that to be lost uh in this discussion it
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
completely eliminates class three which
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
are the existing biomass plants um the
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
the existing biomass plants which do
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
produce electricity so this is more than
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
just thermal recks this is also an
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
electricity generation bill as well um
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to just make sure that's on
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
the record and that you folks um just to
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
kind of put a put a point on that we
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
thermal recks but also the existing
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
biomass plants both contribute to the
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
state's Forest products industry um and
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
and our our economy and one of the
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
pieces so you heard last week about
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
class three kind of the the the
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
industrial or I'll say uh commercial
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
electricity generation to bring the
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
focus to the thermal piece the the
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
thermal piece the thermal wrecks are an
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
important component of a growing and
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
emerging portion of our industry you
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
heard last week from Two testifiers
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
durgen and croll
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
lumber and uh Britain Lumber two
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
Sawmills that are installing wood
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
boilers to generate heat and also
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
electricity and they are also
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
participating in the thermal wck program
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
this program is working it is spurring
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
innovation it's spurring renewable
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
energy um and is a great example of I
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
would say a a success story in trying to
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
diversify what's happening out there on
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
the landscape when it comes to
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
electricity but also when it comes to uh
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
Just Energy in general or heat um so I
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
think you know I again I wanted to just
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
get on the record today that for all the
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that we mentioned last week on
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 219 and kind of the broader
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
impacts on the industry and kind of what
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing on the landscape and our
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
ability to manage that landscape this
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
bill also does also would stifle what I
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
would consider some really neat projects
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
some Innovation that we're seeing that
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
helps diversify and make make sure that
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
these B New Hampshire businesses remain
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
viable and continue to operate and those
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
Pro those businesses again as you heard
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
last week are generating local taxes
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're supporting local jobs
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
and again this is also making them s
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
sufficient and then on the environmental
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of it I think durgen and croll
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
said their their project would displace
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
9,000 gallons of propane consumption a
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
year so with a local local wood product
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
and a product that they generate as well
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
um it was touched on earlier and I'll
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
just bring a point to it about the
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
carbon aspects or the carbon aspects of
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
of burning wood last week I turn I
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
passed out a document it's from the US
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture this is the
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
state's it's called the forest inventory
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
analysis the USDA does an analysis of
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
the entire landscape of New Hampshire
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
once every five years they go out they
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
have a series of plots across the state
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
and they measure Timber growth they
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
measure Timber removals land conversion
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
and a host of other
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
things and think representative Swanson
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
hit the nail on the head trees trees
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
sequester carbon yes you burn carbon
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
carbon is released when you when you
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
burn a tree but that tree if you don't
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
pave over where that tree was removed
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
another is going to to grow in its place
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
in sequester
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
Carbon on page two of this document is a
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
pretty what I what I say is probably the
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
most simple way to look at what's Su
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
what we call sustainability in the state
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire growth forest growth
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
continues to outpace both removals and
 
00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:50.510 align:start position:0%
continues to outpace both removals and
tree

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
tree
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
mortality um and during this period 111
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
million cubic feet of trees are growing
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that's the bet that's the net net
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
change so in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
we continue to grow more wood I.E
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
sequester carbon then we do release it
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
from REM from burning it or putting it
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess the other pieces when you
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
put it in a solid wood product this
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
table this is stored carbon so this
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not burning
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
wood is is sustainable or whether it's
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral we think our our premises
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
is what what clearer picture do you have
 
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.230 align:start position:0%
is what what clearer picture do you have
of

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
sustainability and carbon neutrality or
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
positive carbon than you do with the
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
USDA when you look at the health and
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
growth of our forest I just wanted to
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
point that out um I'll conclude my
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
comments on this again you heard a lot
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
about it the RPS in general and the
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
forest products industry on my testimony
 
00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:54.789 align:start position:0%
forest products industry on my testimony
on

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
219 um there are in addition to Tom
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
christon there are a number of other
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
folks that did put in cards that were
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
unable to make it today um in the forest
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
products World winter is is the time
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
that you make hay frozen ground and so
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to take two days off was they just
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it so they came on last week
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
submitted their testimony and said set
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
please provide the regards you have
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
their testimony on 219 which is also
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
applicable as you pull cards I'll give
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
you the high sign that they're not here
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
but their 219 House Bill 219 testimony
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
applies thank
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you I have a quick question
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
for you since 2014 when class one
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
thermal became a part of the
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
RPS there has never been since 2014
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
there has never been a sufficient number
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
of wrecks generated to cover the
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
obligation in the
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
RPS and yet the percentage has gone
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
up every year since it went up uh Z .4%
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
in 2014 0.6% in 2015 0.8% in
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
2016 and also increased annually by
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
0.2% through
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
20123 if we're not generating enough
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
reck uh
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
um should those
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
percentages go down should the the
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
obligation be
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
decreased it's a great question and it's
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
certainly something to look to look into
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
I I would suggest if this does go into
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
some type of a study or the RPS in
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
general is being looked at in in terms
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
of a study I know back when this was
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
passed there was also some expectations
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
that conquered steam was going to be
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
generating thermal wrecks and of course
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
as we know that project did not did not
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
come to fruition so certainly that would
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
be a question um something to certainly
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at I know Charlie nebling
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
who was I think slated to speak later
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
this morning this is he can speak
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
forwards and backwards about the number
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
of projects and the number of projects
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
in the queue and whether or not there
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
are sufficient projects to to fulfill
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
that obligation he's looking more
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
globally I tend to focus on just the
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
durgen and cwls the Britain numbers the
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the lumber people he's looking at beyond
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
that at other other facilities
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
commercial County that are installing
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
thermal thermal
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
projects and he is on Deck he'll be next
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
all right additional questions
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr stock for
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I wanted to ask
 
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
about the industry because I know that's
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much who you represent you have a
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
lot of knowledge in that regard um my my
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
concern is what changes we would wrought
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
if we we heard testimony last week say
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
from U John Moses who came in front of
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
us from a family business up in bath uh
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
Britain Lumber and he indicated that you
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
know margins are small but with the
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
class one between the class one and
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
class three they're investing in
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
Innovative technology right so they're
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
they're making Investments benefiting
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
the community can you give us an idea of
 
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.630 align:start position:0%
the community can you give us an idea of
the

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
um of the balance right now in that
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
industry in terms of how precarious it
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
might be for some of these businesses to
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
be staying in business because I
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to think that we would be
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
um we would be passing something that
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
would hurt New Hampshire businesses and
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
the the the the timber economy um sure
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
thank you great question I I think with
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
any business any business or industry
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
stability is is
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
Paramount you start you know they're
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
making their their investment Horizon
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the time that they're you know the
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
time and money that they're investing
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
today may be for a project that's two
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
three four years down the road um that
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
project if this if say thermal reck as
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the case of Britain Lumber or durgen
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
en croll is part of that investment
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
decision that they're making today for
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
that project down the road
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
to start introducing legislation or you
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
know passing legislation that pulls that
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
out of this decision process that is
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly disruptive and really hurts
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
that project but ultimately hurts that
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
business um we see it in the logging
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
side of the business as well if I'm a
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
logger and I have a chipper and I'm
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
trying to decide all right I need to
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
make a capital investment I have a 700
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
,000 chipper that I need to purchase do
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
I do I upgrade that chipper or don't I
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
well how is you know I see I hear from I
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
hear from the Timberland owners that
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 219 is being considered House
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 567 being considered all right as a
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
business person as a New Hampshire
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
business person am I going to invest in
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
that chipper if I know there's
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in those markets and so it
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
that uncertainty really wrecks Havoc
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
with kind of investment but also
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
business planning Capital
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
planning I hope I answered your question
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas okay representative McGee thank
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so the followup would
 
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:53.559 align:start position:0%
be also about the low grade timber
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that we hear about
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
a lot is the sort of uh Forest
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance if you will um would that
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
aspect of New Hampshire forestry would
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
that suffer or would Jobs go away for
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
the people who actually move that Timber
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
and get it where it needs to go if if
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
these um businesses that take that would
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
um are no longer in operation or their
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
operations are scaled down because they
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
losing you know these Investments that
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make the answer is
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely we we have seen that when
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
plants um when there were a number of
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
plants that idled after all the vetos
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
that occurred 3 four years ago we saw an
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
immediate contraction in in logging
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
capacity companies that had three
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
crews um maybe a hand crew for for Big
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
Timber and and and then a chipping crew
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
for for chipping type jobs said all
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
right you know I'm getting rid of you
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to lay that I'm going to
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
lay that chipping crew off and I'll just
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
go with one crew the the other piece
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
that happens out of that Dynamic is is
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay I had let's say I had two Crews
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
operating in the woods one was doing
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
chipping work one was doing hand cutting
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
on kind of the high quality high quality
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
saw log lots and then on the the biomass
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
chipping Lots where I had clients that
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
wanted that product I get rid of that
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
well that company is no longer producing
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
the same volume of of Saw logs at the
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
same time that they were when they had
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
two Crews and so what we have also
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
started to see is pressure in The
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
Sawmill or the solid wood side of the
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
sector because there's just less wood
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
being managed the other piece that I
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
think is important and is that there are
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of wood Lots in the state of New
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have been the term is
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
high graded and products like biomass
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
are the only way the only feasible way
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
to economically go in and remove that do
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
that weeding and thinning and move
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
remove that junk wood and so we've
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
gotten to a point where the markets have
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
gotten to the so tight that there are
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
land owners that said all right I'd like
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
you to come in and do this lot and the
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
logger said okay well I can't touch it
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
there's too much low grade there call
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
someone else and so we have Parcels that
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
are not they're just not getting they're
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
just not getting the treatment the siloc
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
cultural treatments that the that they
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
want for long-term growth and
 
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
want for long-term growth and
productivity

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um so uh as
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
you noted the build dresses not only
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks but biomass uh use as
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
well if we were to uh um eliminate the
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
thermal Rex not the biomass what tax
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
would you propose would be a good
 
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.030 align:start position:0%
would you propose would be a good
substitute

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
substitute
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
what would be a good substitute tax to
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
to make up for thermal recks
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
yes it's a great question and that's why
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
it you know I don't have a I don't have
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
a a list of taxes that I'd say ah here
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
you go but um what I can say is this is
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of industries that
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
are tangential to what we do
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
that benefit from the work that happens
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
in our forest whether it's
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
hospitality whether it's Rec outdoor
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
recreation and so you know I think that
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
would make a compelling argument that
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
this is this is a this is a Statewide
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's a Statewide benefit that comes
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
from our forest being healthy in our
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
tourism industry and all of that that
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
goes with that and so again I don't have
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
a silver bullet I don't have a here here
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative bernardy here's tax
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
number one here's tax here's a specific
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
tax that's going to plug this hole I do
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
asking I've been saying since 2015 it
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
ought to come out of the room and meals
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
tax representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and thank you for being
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
here Mr stock um we know that we're
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
seeing dry winter
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
that are leading to droughts in the
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
spring um and your industry are seem to
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
be the stewards of the forests and we
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
have an awful lot of trees in New
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so my question is if we cut
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
back on harvesting the timber in any way
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
would that impact the Wildfire threats
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
that we're um probably going to be
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more of in in New
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire great question you know you
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
you start monkeying or cutting back
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
Management in in the management of
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
forest wildfires are just one of many
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
threats um we have a lot of a lot of
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
invasive bugs and critters coming into
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
the state and eating chewing on our
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
trees that we need to get rid of um
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
anyone with ash trees or hemlock trees
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
will will tell you that between the
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
emerald ashbo and The Woolly ad delid
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a need for markets
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
that consume that consume those chips
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
consume that wood if if you want a
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
health forest fires is is is one piece
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
um that's one one piece of the puzzle
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
but there's just general Forest Health
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
and productivity that we need to keep in
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
mind as well thank you you're
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
welcome representative partiall has a
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and welcome Mr
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
stock um I'm trying to ask this question
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
in the way that uh my constituents I
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
received quite a bit of mail on this
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue on and many of them do seem
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
concerned and I know that online we have
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
245 oppos this bill seven people support
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
it so here goes by eliminating thermal
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
reck will we be more dependent upon
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
Expendable and imported fossil fuel in
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
your opinion this two-part question well
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I think durgen and croll
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
gave us the the the perfect answer to
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
that question with
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
990,000 was it 90,000 gallons of propane
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
they are displacing with their with
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
their boiler boiler project which is
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's one project that is that is tied
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
to the thermal wreck program so
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
following up then in your opinion would
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
this potentially create a more
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
dependency on fossil fuel and more
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
volatility in consumer prices such as we
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
saw in uh
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
2022 I yes the answer is yes I think and
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
we you know not to go down to Rabbit
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hole but energy you know it's having
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy sources it's like
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
your stock portfolio you're going to
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
have shares of different products
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
because everything doesn't move at once
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
energy is the same same way and I'll let
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the the utility energy people talk about
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
speak to that but I think biomass is a
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
great hedge it is a local native fuel um
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
that comes out of our forest we are the
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
second most forested state in the nation
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
it is a great hedge against some of this
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
volatility and where these plants are
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
located across the
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
state is it also provides some you know
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
some stability out there because they're
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
out on the landscape and it's not one
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
central location on the Sea Coast of New
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's trying to distribute
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
power you have local generation that's
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
occurring dispersed across the landscape
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
which I would also argue is as much as
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
the fuel diversity is also a benefit
 
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.309 align:start position:0%
the fuel diversity is also a benefit
thank

00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing no more questions
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
we need to move along here I've got a
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
dozen pink cards left and we have two
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
other public hearings this morning so we
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
need to try to we've already spent over
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
an hour on this well actually almost an
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
hour and 45 minutes on this subject so I
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
think it's I think we're starting to
 
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.589 align:start position:0%
think it's I think we're starting to
hear

00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
repetitive uh information and I'm not
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
sure that's going to get us anywhere
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
next up is Charlie
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
nebling Good Morning Charlie welcome
 
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
nebling Good Morning Charlie welcome
back

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
please make some original points and
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
make them as quickly as you can I will
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um my name is Charlie nebling
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a a Forester I live in bosin New
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've spent probably the
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
last 15 years of my career as a an
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
advocate supporter of uh modern wood
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
Heat eating and combined heat and power
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
technology in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
because I think it's good for the State
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm circulating two sets of
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
testimony my own as well as that of Mr
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
Joe Hogan who is the
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
CEO of Continuum at North Conway the
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
developers of the Ridgeline Community
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
project in Conway Mr Hogan I believe was
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
here last week but was unable to be here
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
today so you can REM remove his card but
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh with his permission I've I've
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
submitted his written
 
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.950 align:start position:0%
submitted his written
testimony

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit about the history
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
thermal this was
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
debated extensively during the uh
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
original RPS legislation in
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
2006 as a study bill in 2007 is House
 
00:42:53.319 --> 00:42:54.589 align:start position:0%
2006 as a study bill in 2007 is House
Bill

00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
873 ultimately the legislation set in
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
motion a study by the Public Utilities
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
Commission of adding thermal to the
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
RPS and in addition the original
 
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.190 align:start position:0%
RPS and in addition the original
enabling

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation recognized the benefit of a
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
more fuel diverse and Technology neutral
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
RPS by allowing the renewable energy
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
fund to be utiliz for thermal renewable
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
projects in the original Bill House Bill
 
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.549 align:start position:0%
projects in the original Bill House Bill
873

00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
873
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
um in 2011 there was a bill to recognize
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
heat from combined heat and power
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
projects in the
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
RPS that same year the Pu issued their
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
study indicating that the addition of
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
thermal to the RPS was feasible and in
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
2012 it was incorporated as part of a
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive RPS Reform Bill uh which
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
was heard by this committee debated and
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
discussed and deliberated over
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
extensively by the legislature that year
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
and ultimately passed in the form of
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
218 so there's a little bit of History
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
um as I've indicated before to the
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee I think the primary reason
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
that it passed was because thermal was
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately structured as a carve out in
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
class one and assigned a much lower
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment a cealing
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
price uh I believe at the time class one
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
electric was
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
$55 and maybe a little bit higher
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
because of the annual CPI
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment and the ACP for thermal was
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
set at $25 so it was seen primarily as a
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure but also a move to
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
diversify the
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
RPS um by recognizing thermal
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
Technologies and a reminder to the
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee we use more heat energy in New
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than we do electricity it is
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
more than onethird of the total energy
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
consumed in this state and that is per
 
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.549 align:start position:0%
consumed in this state and that is per
the

00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
eia um my testimony summarizes some
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
statistics based on the number of
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
projects that have become eligible to
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
generate thermal wrecks that list which
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
came from the Department of energy
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
website and is dated or updated as of
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
December 2024 is on the last three pages
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
of my
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but a few statistics the total
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
installed capacity of these systems
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
which are biomass and
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
geothermal is 57 megawatts that is
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
approaching the the installed capacity
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
or name plate capacity of the Burgess
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
biopower plant in Berlin which I believe
 
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
is 70
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
megaw um
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
these are property poor school districts
 
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.309 align:start position:0%
these are property poor school districts
rural

00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
rural
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals County
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
facilities uh businesses Municipal
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
facilities uh State uh University system
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
campuses Plymouth keen and the Thompson
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
school at
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
UNH uh so they they reflect a sort of a
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
interesting diversity of
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries many of them financed by
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
public tax
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
dollars um and the primary reason that
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
people consider this technology is to
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
reduce operating cost
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
now these systems come with a higher
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
Capital cost uh burning wood a solid
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
fuel is just fundamentally more complex
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
an engineering proposition than burning
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
oil or gas they're anywhere from two to
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
four times the capex of a comparably
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
sized propane natural gas or oil system
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a big upfront cost and wrecks
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
are seen as a way either of paying down
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
that Capital cost and reducing the
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
payback period or and or reducing
 
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.950 align:start position:0%
payback period or and or reducing
operating

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
cost these systems spend approximately
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
$7 million a year on chips and pellets
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
sourced from within New Hampshire those
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
are fuel dollars that stay here
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
circulate in our economy and multiply
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
and they've displaced the need for over
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
4.1 million gallons of heating oil
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
equivalent on an annual basis so there
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
is a significant economic benefit to the
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they have spurred
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
Innovation uh you heard Mr stock
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
reference several projects I want to
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
mention three additional projects uh DCI
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
Furniture in Lisbon New Hampshire which
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
is the last large Manu uh furniture
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the state with 165
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
employees is in the process of
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
installing a biomass combined heat and
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
power system that will generate thermal
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
wrecks the balsam's Redevelopment which
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
is on again off again I recognize that
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
but uh they tore out an old
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
inefficient uh wood burning boiler that
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
heated the hotel complex and are
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
planning a significant new addition and
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
expansion of that
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
complex and the last Mr chairman is the
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
Ridgeline project which you have
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from Mr Hogan uh speaking to
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of that that's been three
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
or four years in planning and financing
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
during a very difficult financing period
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
That's 126 acre uh combined senior
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
residential assisted living and
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
Commercial camp cus in the Redstone area
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
of Conway it's a green field development
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
that fact the fact that you are in the
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
ground uh building at the same time you
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
are making a decision about how you're
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to heat makes possible District
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
Heating and there is a site plan this is
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
dated early January
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
20125 that
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
um helps to illustrate the scope of the
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
campus and the number of buildings that
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
will be heated from the district plant
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
and I should add that it's only the
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
larger buildings the smaller Cottages
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
are are not costeffective to heat with
 
00:49:38.839 --> 00:49:40.950 align:start position:0%

the others that I
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned and to conclude my
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um Mr chairman I just want to
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
speak to a couple of of the comments
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Harrington made
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
the question that representative
 
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.950 align:start position:0%
the question that representative
Bernardi

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
Bernardi
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
posed and comments from a witness uh
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
week ago I think the reason we've seen a
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
Slowdown in modern wood heat is probably
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
four or five-fold first um in the
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
mid2 Oil and Propane dropped in price
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
that price differential drives
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
consideration of renewable heating
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
Alternatives probably more than anything
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
else I think the attention that
 
00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
else I think the attention that
strategic

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
electrification has received across the
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
board in all aspects of energy
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
consumption um
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
has in in a way sort of sucked the
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
oxygen out of the room and pushed to the
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
fringes uh nonel electric renewable
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
Technologies I think the controversy
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
over the biomass power plants and the
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
attention that uh Governor sununu's
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
vetos received perhaps had a um a
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on consideration of the
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
use of wood even though the use of wood
 
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.630 align:start position:0%
use of wood even though the use of wood
in

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
heating um and to address a
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
misconception of Representative
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington's is on the order of 75 to
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
95% output efficient based on the fuel
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
and the technology
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
used and lastly um this committee has
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
heard no fewer than four bills in the
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
last seven or eight years to eliminate
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
thermal or repeal or significantly alter
 
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.230 align:start position:0%
thermal or repeal or significantly alter
the

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
RPS I can't emphasize enough what an
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
impact that has on the marketplace and
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
on those who are responding to a price
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
signal set in the original enabling
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and who are planning
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
projects with a two to
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
foure cycle uh that is from conception
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the idea to
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
implementation financing and
 
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.349 align:start position:0%
implementation financing and
implementation

00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
to to not know whether this policy will
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
be in place or not
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
um it's had a chilling effect House Bill
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
225 in 2017 House Bill 213 in
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
20122 House Bill 166 and
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
2023 and two years ago this committee
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
passed by a 19 to1 committee vote House
 
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:47.549 align:start position:0%
passed by a 19 to1 committee vote House
Bill

00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
233 which actually set in motion a
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
process at the department of energy to
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
consider alternative heat verification
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
strategy for smaller systems why did you
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
do that and Mr chairman you were Prime
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to Avail the
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
incentive to a broader array of
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
Technologies and in particular smaller
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
systems for which
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the um BTU meters was too
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
expensive a proposition and incidentally
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
that process is underway at the doe and
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll have a draft uh of of
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
alternative measure to consider
 
00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:31.109 align:start position:0%
alternative measure to consider
relatively

00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
soon to your question representative
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi um this these Technologies used
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
to benefit from a 30% Federal renewable
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
energy investment tax credit the Biden
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
Administration took that away uh as a
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
condition of the passage of the
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction Act and the clean
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
electricity standard that was in that
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill they foreclosed on the ability of
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
high efficiency Heaton systems to be
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for that credit so uh one
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
possible means of uh restoring some
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
measure of uh incentive for Capital cost
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
would be to restore the federal
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
investment credit on these
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
systems and I just wanted to bring that
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
to your attention and that concludes my
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chairman I'd be happy to
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions two quick questions
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
number one can you define district for
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
us you talked about District Heating and
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
the second question is can you contrast
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
the price of wood heating versus propane
 
00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:42.069 align:start position:0%
the price of wood heating versus propane
or

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
oil yes uh District heating would be uh
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
where you have a central heat plant and
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
heat is distributed through a grid
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
either in the form of steam low pressure
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
high pressure or more efficient hot
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
water through super insulated
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
underground piping two buildings where
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
that heat is transferred to through a
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
heat exchanger to a hydronic Grid in the
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
building uh it's very efficient the
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
technology has been uh developed and
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
improved in Europe it's available here
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
in the US there are many examples of
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
that uh uh right here in New Hampshire
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
marac Valley school district has a
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
district heating plant for four
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
buildings heated with wood which
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
parenthetically they replaced a
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
resistance electric heating in their
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
high school when they did that um there
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
are other good examples conquer steam
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
was was the biggest example before um
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
before that that uh system went offline
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
ago uh the second question is what is
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the comparative cost green chips are
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to be somewhere around
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
$6 to9 per million btu on a heat output
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
basis dry chips
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 12
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
to15 per million btu and Mr froling can
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
that pellets somewhere between $8 and
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
$22 per million
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
btu propane depending on what the price
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
is today but at uh $350 or $4 a gallon
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
is north of $30 a million btu and oil at
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
I think the last time I checked the uh
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
doe website it was
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
$3.9 a gallon residential retail
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
delivered is somewhere around3 or $32 a
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
million btu so that's the comparative
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
heat cost but that's just uh sort of an
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparison based on
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of conversion of that
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
heat and the Heat and the energy content
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the fuel and its moisture
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
content okay thank you anybody else have
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
question representative partial thank
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
you chair V and thank you for your
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
testimony today um my school board uh a
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
few years ago installed a a um dry chip
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh heating system and a concern was
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
expressed to me I'm hope you can explain
 
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
this to me that with the loss of thermal
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
recks uh to uh um supplement the cost of
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
heating they would probably have to pass
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
those costs on to their to our taxpayers
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
and the result of high and resulting in
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
higher property taxes is that uh are
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
they accurate in that
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
assessment uh yes they are they're
 
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.829 align:start position:0%
assessment uh yes they are they're
probably

00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
receiving somewhere between 20 and say
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
$24 per megawatt hour U of of gross
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
revenue from the sale of those thermal
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
wrecks uh that is revenue that and I
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what the policy is in your
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
school district but in in many school
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
districts that's used to reduce
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
operating cost offset other unrelated
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
operating costs and or pay down Capital
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
cost on the original
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
investment now if if that Revenue isn't
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
coming in it has to be either they have
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
to reduce costs through other means or
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh they have to uh replace that Revenue
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
with with taxpayer dollars or some other
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue thank
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee please make it
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
quick thank you Mr chair I will so on
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
line 17 of the bill where they're
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
listing uh classes uh in the RPS and uh
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
under class three on line 17 it
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
basically says 2025 and thereafter we're
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to go from an 8% a lot that's been
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
there since 2015 to 1% can you speak to
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
what that change would do to people who
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
are participating now because I'm not
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
sure everyone here is clear on that that
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of drop from 8 to 1% well
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's class three is the existing
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
biomass and landfill gas projects uh
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
there are probably others
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
here more uh able to speak to the impact
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
of that change on supply and demand d
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
dyamics and wreck prices
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
but in general if you lower the purchase
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
obligation and the amount of Supply
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
remains constant the value of those
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
crash okay seeing no more questions I'm
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
going to invite next up to the U well
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
before I invite the next
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
speaker I'm gonna have to say you have
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
forced my hand we still have 12 cards
 
00:59:55.559 --> 00:59:57.230 align:start position:0%
forced my hand we still have 12 cards
left

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
left
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're already two hours into a public
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill so I'm going to
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
have to limit testimony from this point
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
forward to two and a half minutes per
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
person and if we don't finish by 10:30
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to have to suspend or
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
recess this public hearing yet
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
again which I think is totally
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but like I say you force my
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
hand so next up jod grimas please give
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
us uh your perspective as quickly as
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
possible I am going to talk so fast two
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
and a half minutes keep
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
my name is jod Grimble ASM lobbyist here
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
in conquered my client is Bridgewater
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
power company Michael Larry was here
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
last week he could not be here today I'm
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
passing around his testimony I think a
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
lot of what I would have said has
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
already been said by by Mr stock and Mr
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
nebling so I'll be very brief to tell
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
you two couple a couple quick
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
things yes the issue in the build itself
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
for us an existing biomass power plant
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
is on line 17 in the bill which is class
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
three where it goes from 8% to 1% and
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
then also on page two section four it
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
says class three and it strikes out
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
existing biomass so that is where the
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
independent biomass producers that are
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
currently have been existed since 2000
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
well in this program since 2007 would be
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
wiped out you would only have methane as
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
part of class three that is the part
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
that we're very concerned about because
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would impact um those benefits that
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about today so um
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
that is specifically to the existing
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
biomass plants again I think about the
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
biomass plant benefits is three energy
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
economy environment I think you've heard
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
a lot about energy their Basel load 247
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
probably 360 to out of 365 days a year
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
they produce energy electricity um
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
economy they have payroll they're
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
usually the biggest tax players in their
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
area and that supply chain of wood which
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard all about very important to
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
the um local and Statewide economy and
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
then environment you've heard about
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
sustaining forestry um weeding the
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
thinning the forest weeding the garden
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
decreasing fire risk and you also
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
learned about the byproduct of wood ash
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot of farmers in the state
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so those are the reason
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
we oppose it um the only thing I would
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
add and Charlie touched on it briefly is
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative history this same exact
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill has been to this legislature twice
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
before uh 2022 it was House Bill 213 and
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
it was sent to interim study by a vote
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
of 21 to Z from this committee um House
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 166 which actually came out in
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
2024 um was voted 19 to1 inexpedient to
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'll leave you with this
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would have eliminated biomass
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
wood from receiv receiving Rex the wood
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
industry remains extremely important to
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
the state for many jobs and the health
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
of our forests elimination of this class
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
would only further damage an already
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
struggling industry not only in the
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
North country but Statewide for this
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
reason the majority of the committee
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
felt this bdy was not ready to be
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
enacted and recommends inexpedient to
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
legislate that was 2024 so I'm hoping
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
you'll find this bill in expedient to
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
legislate the blurb is already written
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
and um thank you very much for your
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you seeing no questions I'll
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
invite the next person up which is
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
Conservancy does not appear to be here
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on and H have Sam Evans
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
Brown give us whoops gave you the wrong
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
card Sam Evans Brown up
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
next two and a half minutes Sam
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh cleaners and Hampshire
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
similarly is in opposition to this bill
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to reiterate something
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
that Charlie nebling did mention but
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
just to just to call it out since
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie said a lot of really valuable
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
things uh just two years ago in 202
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
three this this body unanimously passed
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
HB 233 which created uh the possibility
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
for creating new metering standards that
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
should solve the supply constraint of
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
thermal renewable energy credits and
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
make available the production and
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
consumption of of T-Rex to residential
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
customers which I think is a uh positive
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
step forward uh unfortunately due to uh
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
statutory concerns about the creation of
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy they felt they
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't proceed with that Ru making
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
until they had been given additional
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
authority to to uh to make decisions by
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
rule or order so there was a second bill
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
that was required last year before that
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
rule making could commence it is now
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
underway and so as soon as it's
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
completed there's I think a lot of us
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
are quite hopeful that there will be
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
more thermal wrecks that are flooding
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
into the market and dealing with the the
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
cost of compliance issue that has been
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
flagged by by a couple of folks um the
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
second thing as I would I would just uh
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
say I do think there is a strong Nexus
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
between electricity
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
rates uh and the the thermal sector
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
right so anytime we have a a source that
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
is producing heat during New England's
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
particular particularly challenging
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
times which is the the cold dark days of
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
winter which is when our natural gas
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
pipelines are constrained any source
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is that is taking that strain off
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the natural gas pipeline network is
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
going to result in lower electricity
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
bills so in so far as we have uh thermal
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
sources supplementing electric heating
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
or natural gas heating it's going to
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
result in in lower electric rates so I
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
think there is a strong argument for
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
this program being attached to electric
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
rates uh and with that I'll close my
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
testimony okay see no okay seeing no
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Sam Evans Brown thank
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
you sir for your testimony and next
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
meis thank you chairman thank you
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
committee my my name is Jared Muller I'm
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
here representing misus we are a
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
residential um wood pellet borderer
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and also a distributor of
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
wood pets we distribute about 12 to
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
15,000 tons
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
annually and I wanted to talk about kind
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the unclear messaging we were excited
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
about Bill 233 to include residential
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
things at a easier
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
rate uh to be part of this and now we're
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
seeing this in opposition of that and
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
quite concerning we have decided not to
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
do business in the state of New
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on two occasions because of
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
kind of the inconsistent messaging
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
regarding biomass and have built a Depot
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts instead and we'll
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
proceed forth probably building one in
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont in the next couple of years and
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
have skipped that's been a problem
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
couple of things I wanted to bring up as
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
well that does need to be the Rex
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh we were excited about the being made
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
easier for the residential Market the
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
unclear messaging uh for the State of
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and repeatedly bringing
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
this up year after year or a couple
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
years in between and a couple things I
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
also wanted to touch upon in 2018 when
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
the us. Environmental Protection Agency
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
under the Trump
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
administr trump Administration
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
officially declared biomass to be carbon
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
neutral I'll allow representative Mr
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
Harrington to debate that with his
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic colleagues because they're
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that have challenged that and
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
also two that uh if you do refer to the
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
Wood pet heating database of the EPA
 
01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:37.190 align:start position:0%
Wood pet heating database of the EPA
certified

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
equipment they are upwards of 90%
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
efficient and then some uh thank you for
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
consideration okay thank you seeing no
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
chair hi nice to see you again um thank
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
you for being here today so uh it it
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
sounds like you you've been following
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing here because you
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
you were planning to maybe be doing
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire and then you
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
thought better of it from your statement
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
so my question is you said that you you
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned twice that you thought that we
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
were providing unclear messaging like to
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing but is it unclear
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
messaging or is it unclear policy uh uh
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
unclear policy unclear yeah yeah okay
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
thanks okay seeing no further questions
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
froling representative Wendy Thomas has
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair um you
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you've stopped doing um
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
deliveries in New Hampshire or work in
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can you um specifically
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
give me the impact of how
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
much chips you have not provided and and
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
what that would equal in in terms of
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
energy well I I don't have the numbers
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
in front of me as far as how many you
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
know but you have quite a few people
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
that have taken advantage of some of
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
your rebates and have installed
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
residential systems that
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
are kind of waiting for these wrecks to
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
be easier like we talked about in the
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
previous Bill and this obviously would
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
squash that which I think this whole
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
committee thought would be a good idea
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
to make it um instead of net metering to
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
do it based on actual weight of what was
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
delivered uh which is programs that
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
other states have modeled your program
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
but have made it a little easier and
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
have been highly beneficial and
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
successful in particular in Maine um so
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to qualify it totally
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
but um certainly an impact and has
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
certainly steered us clear of here to
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
invest further thank you very much okay
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no more further
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions I'll ask Mark froling to come
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
up and give us his perspective in two
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
minutes that's perfect for me I'm a man
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
of few words but thank you so much um
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative Vose for holding this
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
discussion um obviously this um wreck
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
incentive is really important for our
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
company uh but more so than our company
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
because we're just a very small company
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
um it is actually really important for
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
our customers um who are their wreck
 
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.510 align:start position:0%
our customers um who are their wreck
recipients

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
and so these Rec of our of all of our
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
clients is actually uh the rec
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
recipients are mostly of public um
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
Schools public um counties and things
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
like that so it's about um most of our
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
Recs about um 80% go to um back back to
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
the state and so they would be the
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
losers of that and so um how does that
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
money where does that money come from
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
when the rec goes away it would actually
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
come from the taxpayers so for instance
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
um in Jaffrey New Hampshire I I believe
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
you you live in Jeffrey or close by
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
anyway so represented Jeffrey and um so
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
in that school and I can't do the
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
physical calculations for that if they
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
are getting you know they're using 300
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
tons right now and so they're getting 90
 
01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:18.110 align:start position:0%
tons right now and so they're getting 90
90

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
90
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
wrecks um uh no sorry 900 recks in a
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
year right now it's about $188,000 worth
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
that money would have to then come from
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers clearly because that money
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
is now no long longer available same for
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
Treasure County they're getting a little
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
bit over 2 and a half thousand wrecks
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
that money would have to come from the
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
state itself so 80% of the rec that our
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
company has installed and we're sort of
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you know a larger installer for sure
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
for this technology um um goes directly
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
back to the state or to municipalities
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
and to to individual towns so that money
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
will have to come from the taxpayers in
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the future I don't see any way around it
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
so it's really just shifting it from the
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
rate payers to the taxpayers but it it's
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
not coming from other places so I just
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
want people to be aware about who who
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
who they're levying the tax or the
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
incentive to in the
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
future um as far as um represent
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative Harrington um
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the combustion efficiency um as
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned by you in the 40% is about 99%
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
combustion efficiency the overall
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
thermal efficiency of a boiler maybe
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's what you were targeting at is
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
between you know on a steam boiler in
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
the 70s all the way up into the 92% on a
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
pallet boiler with drier fuel so um and
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
as per um the EPA we are carbon neutral
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
in our technology um I typically use the
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
word near carbon neutral because um I
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
feel like it represents that a little
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
bit better because we make deliveries
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
with diesel trucks and we go into the
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
forest with chainsaws and things like
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
that and even though the carbon cycle is
 
01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
quite neutral in its Behavior I like to
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
also kind of own up to it there's use of
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
um of fossil fuel technology in our
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
industry and so I like to really be very
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
transparent about that and typically use
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
the term near carbon neutral
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a fair
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
representation okay thank you for your
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
testimony one quick question when you
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
talked about the efficiency of the
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
boilers was that using green wood or
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
dried wood yeah the efficiency is it's a
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
great question um clearly maybe an
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
engineer or something like that but um
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
the deficiency is mostly related to the
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
um water content in in in the fuel so um
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you have 50% moisture in the fuel and
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
in your wood that comes from the tree
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
and you put it into the um boiler the
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
usable energy that you get out um is
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
only a portion of that because it takes
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of energy to actually burn off the
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
water in there first so then you have
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
the remaining energy that you that you
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
can use in your radiators and things
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
like that and so that energy is sort of
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
the um you
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
know that efficiency um is basically
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
calculates how how
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
much the the useful versus the nonuseful
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
energy is kind of calculates how
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
efficient your overall boiler thermal
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency is so and so typically we you
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
know on a on a steam boiler it can't be
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
quite as efficient because of the higher
 
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
temperatures and the conversion to steam
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
we have some losses there and so um hot
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
water boilers tend to be a little bit
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
more efficient but it really mostly
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
depends on the moisture cont off the
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
fuel so your answer is that drier fuel
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
burns more efficiently much more yes do
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
any because you're in this business do
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
you have any data about the cost of
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
drying the fuel the and the amount of
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
energy that's needed to dry the fuel how
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
does that compare to
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the resulting efficiency of the fuel
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
once it's burned in a boiler cost versus
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency see H but physics of physics
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically takes the same amount of
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
energy no matter where you are if you
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
are drying it in your boiler versus in
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
um so if we're drying Fuel and it taks a
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
certain amount of energy and of course
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
related cost um it takes the same amount
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
of energy to dry it in somebody else's
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
boiler on site at a school the reason
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
why we do that is just like refining
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
fuel oil for instance um you refine it
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
so a car can run very efficient is same
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
reason why you actually season your wood
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
in your cordwood boiler um if you don't
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
season it then you have a lot of other
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
um tars in your chimney and things like
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
that that makes it very undesirable so
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's really just a refining process and
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
it takes a certain amount of energy and
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
it just makes it more useful um one more
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
quick thing that I wanted to say even
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
though we are receiving this incentive
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
is quite clear to me um and um a lot of
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
people seem like it's maybe it's not
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
quite fair to receive this incentive and
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
things like that I believe Mr Harrington
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
was saying something that we shouldn't
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
be getting this but you know there's uh
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
the oil and gas industry and I have a
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
couple Pages I'm I'm super limited on
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
time here so I can't really read these
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
all but there's two two pages of oil and
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
gas incentives um that are actually in
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
our federal tax code and so we don't
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
have any of these tax incentives from a
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
federal standpoint and so we're just
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
literally getting this tiny little slice
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the pie here and it is really
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
beneficial for our state as I mentioned
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
our primary beneficiary of this wreck is
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
actually directly back into the state I
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't really see why that is so
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
important for Mr Harrington to sort of
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate that incentive okay no
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
debating here we're just trying to find
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
answers to questions anyways there's
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
other going to debate me I want a chance
 
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
other going to debate me I want a chance
to

01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
respond no because we're not going to
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
have a debate
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative L relle has a question
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah thank you Mr chair it's a
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
very simple question do any of these
 
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
very simple question do any of these
boil

01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
boil
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
designs allow for condensing
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
boilers yes you can um you can make a
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
wood boiler condensing boiler
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
correct thank you all right no further
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
questions we'll move along to Mr Kevin
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
everyone I'll try and be quick as I said
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Kevin Porter here and conquered our
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
family owns and operates Timberlands
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
throughout Marram County uh largely to
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
provide a source of thermal energy
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like you've already gotten a
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
primer on forestry so I'll try and stick
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
to energy economics here um now more
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
than ever thermal energy and electricity
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
are intertwined and that's only going to
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
increase with heat pump adoption and
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
heat pumps are great uh but they do add
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
to those wintertime peaks in demand
 
01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
which is becoming more of an issue here
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh by supplementing
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
those with wood energy it's a great way
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
to smooth out those demands and provide
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
a another way to generate heat for
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial and
 
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.750 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial and
Industrial

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
Industrial
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
customers um secondly related to that uh
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
going forward our Energy System is
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
moving from one of a small number of
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
large Institution power plants to where
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have a larger number of small
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
distributed generation uh and wood
 
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
energy is a a prime example of that uh
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
for those that may study our electric
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
bills you may have noticed that the
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
largest reason we've seen increase is
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
because of transmission and distribution
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
so by having smaller projects like wood
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
projects we can help mitigate those
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
costs um that have been hitting all of
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
us in the in the pocketbook last thing
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'll say um re are really about uh
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
sending price signal sign to the market
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
and they're really about monetizing
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
externalities for every gallon of fossil
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel Fuel Oil propane that's
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
purchased in New Hampshire most of that
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
leaves the state and we never see it
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
again um if it's in the winter time it
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
probably leaves the country and we never
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
see it again uh but if we're talking
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
about wood energy you have a whole
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
ecosystem of land owners loggers
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
truckers Mill Operators um help recycle
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
that money and and keep it
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
local um
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
with that I urge you to oppose this Bill
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
much okay seeing no questions we want to
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to talk to us and
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Matt Ley of the forest
 
01:20:05.719 --> 01:20:11.229 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Matt Ley of the forest
Society

01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
next good morning thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Matt Ley I'm the
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
public policy director for the society
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
for the protection of New Hampshire
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
Forest um I'll be brief uh we oppose the
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill and it's really you know when we
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
look at the purpose for the RPS that's
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
where our opposition comes from you know
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
that purpose talks about local renewable
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
fuels and resources you know further
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
talks about you know how these types of
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
sources can um lower our dependence on
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
other fossil fuel sources and it you
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
know again talks about you know how the
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
RPS keeps energy investment dollars in
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire those are all valid goals
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
they were valid when the RPS was
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
established and they still are so again
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
um we oppose the bill but I'll take any
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions want to
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and give
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
the last word here to John Gage from
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
minutes and please make this about the
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
bill and thermal energy and nothing else
 
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
bill and thermal energy and nothing else
please

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and committee for
 
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I oppose this bill
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Harington I'm a rate
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
payer so you can ask me um reducing
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
demand for gas heating will lower the
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
demand um will lower the prices uh and
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
so this is just a sensible thermal and
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
electricity um energy are mixed as we
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
heard um I think we need it's important
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
to diversify our state's energy
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
resources um
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to talk about why this
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee seems to be stumbling on a lot
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
of these things um there seems to be a
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
disrespect for science in particular
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
climate science I'm going to have to
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
stop you there that's not the subject
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
this public hearing you like to discuss
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
this bill we'd be happy to hear it but
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh you're dismissed I do so
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the external costs
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
of the pollution that were mentioned
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
before from fossil fuels not being
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
reflected in their prices is going to
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
end soon and the state should be aware
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
of that and the reason that it's not is
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
the influence of the fossil fuel
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
industry through money funding front
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
groups that have a strong influence in
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
our energy policy mix they're confusing
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
you they're tricking you and this is
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
causing a problem in decisions like for
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um okay you're not addressing
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
the subject of the bill so I'm going to
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
cut off your testimony there and thank
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
you very much for being here and close
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill HB 567
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
FN and I will now open a public heing on
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 674
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
FN relative to non wires or nonwire
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
Alternatives time of use tariffs and
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
multi-year rate settings and call on
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislation morning Mr chair and good
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
morning fellow committee
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
members I'm going to be brief about HB
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
674 FN this is a a bill that is intended
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle for utility reform and as
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
you're all aware uh utility reform is a
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
heavy lift and um so this bill really is
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
a work in
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
progress and I would love to see nothing
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
better than to have this bill retained
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
in committee and to uh undertake a study
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
on utility reform on a bipartisan basis
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
because I think that we are you know
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
from the 30,000 foot view that people
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
like to reference I think we are largely
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
in agreement on the aims of utility
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
regulation and what we want the
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
utilities to do better at namely bring
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
on more generation keep costs low and
 
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
enhance uh Marketplace competition while
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time uh maintaining a viable
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
utility business for their shareholders
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
so you know it's a it's a hybrid
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
structure uh it always needs to be
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
looked at and uh pushed forward um I
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
think the utility on their own aren't
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
going to do that they're quite happy to
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know go through pu docket after pu
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
docket and then come to us retroactively
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
and say can you please fix this in
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
statute I think that's not our duty as a
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
legislature we ought to be looking at
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
how to frame utility structure to best
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
serve our constituents and uh so
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully this bill might be a vehicle
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
to start that kind of conversation
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise um I think that's all I've got
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
to say on it I'm happy to answer
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
questions or defer to people coming
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you representative Kaplan
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one yeah
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to clarify this so I
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
understand um when it talks about
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
required default service providers to
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
establish fear and reasonable time of
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
use tariffs so you're referring there
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
just to the energy portion of the
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
electric bill not the transmission and
 
01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
electric bill not the transmission and
distribution

01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that I mean time of
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
use tariffs come from the demand side
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
right so that would have to that entails
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
some sort of distribution of the
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
electricity I'm follow up follow up yeah
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not maybe um maybe my question
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't very clear I'm just trying to
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
figure what you're saying here I think
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to say that
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
the utility shall provide fear and
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable time abuse tariff for
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
seasonal daily Peak and off peak usage
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
for everybody and the electric bill is
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
broken into multiple parts and the two
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
major ones are transmission and
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
distribution and then um energy uh which
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
is you know somewhere around 45% so
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
would this apply just to the default
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
service energy and I bring this up
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
because let's say I was buying from a um
 
01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
a third party rather than from the
 
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
utility I was getting my energy from a
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
third party would I also pay higher
 
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
transmission or would that affect my
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution cost or
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
would those be unaffected by this bill
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure I'm able to
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
answer that I mean I know that there are
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know questions about third party
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
providers and and whether they're paying
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
their fair share of transmission and
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
distribution so that's a very
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
complicated question I'm not able to
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
answer that thank
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%

Department of energy um the department
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
does have a number of concerns with this
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill but um I think given Mr or excuse
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
me representative kaplan's testimony um
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%

01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
we're happy to yield our time um and uh
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%

representative Kaplan did you say you
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
didn't want this bill to go
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
forward I'm going to leave that in the
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
hands of the committee I I would love
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%

all right then you don't have to go
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
through your point by point if we're um
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
going to be considering this at a later
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
time so we can move on so thank
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
you last up on this bill is Alexander
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
spidel of the New Hampshire Public
 
01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.310 align:start position:0%
spidel of the New Hampshire Public
Utilities

01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
Commission good morning uh Mr chairman
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh the
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission wanted to
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
indicate that we don't necessarily have
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
a set position on a number of these
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
Provisions but the position that we do
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
have that we'd like to put forward
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
before the committee is that we had
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding subpart Roman
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
3C and the issue we have with this is
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
for starters it says if you look at
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 line 18 on page one of the bill
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
it says that the department of energy
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
and Public Utilities Commission and then
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
when you go to part C uh line one of
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill it says set rate
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
cases in accordance with RSA 3787 so we
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag to the committee
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy does not
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
set rate cases the Public Utilities
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
Commission adjudicates rate cases um
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
furthermore the commission wanted to put
 
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
in a plug and uh last year I had given
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony in this general area as well
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the favorability of the
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
six-month default service rate setting
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
cycle uh it's been established for our
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
regulated utility since the early 2000s
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the case of Liberty and also
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
Unitil and definitely uh for PSNH right
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
away when they went into divesture mode
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
their six rate uh six-month rate cycle
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
started uh for the procurements in
 
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.709 align:start position:0%
started uh for the procurements in
around

01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
2018 so uh the benefit of that six-month
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
rate cycle versus a fiveyear cycle is
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
that there can be responsiveness to
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
market conditions as they develop and
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
that often means upside benefit for
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
consumers when prices go down and I
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
would also throw out to the committee to
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
as a point of uh consideration is
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
imagine if we were sitting here in
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
February of 2020 uh what would our
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
crystal ball tell us about the World
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
Market and uh political events of the
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
next 5 years I I don't know if we would
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily guess exactly what would be
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
happening over the next 5 years in
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
February of 2020
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
um so that would be the substance of my
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
remarks thank you any questions for Mr
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
spidal representative Harrington has
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
one yeah so I'm a little confused with
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
with that what that has to do with this
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
bill you are saying that a
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
fiveyear but this bill talks about a
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
fiveyear average I would guess this
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
talks about time of use tariff which I'm
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
assuming would be uh instantaneous based
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
on the LMP or the the real time time
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
either that or day ahead uh no
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington we're not
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
addressing the time of view segment of
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill that we're looking
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
segment that we're looking at is part C
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
of Roman 3 which says that rates for
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
State Electric default service customers
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
are established every 5 years that's a
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
five-year rate setting cycle for the
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
default service energy rates okay
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
followup followup that's but that's what
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about how can you have time
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
of use rates and have a fiveyear rate it
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
seems like you can't have one or the
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
other but you can't have both that's an
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
excellent question I uh I would think I
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
would defer to representative kaplan's
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh characterization of this being a work
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
in progress but it seems like the two uh
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
things are in tension great tension
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct thank
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none let's get the
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
utilities perspective on this bill and
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
eversource and by the way that is the
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh chairman uh
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Michael AATA on
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
behalf of eversource uh I'll be
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
exceptionally brief uh we do have a
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
number of concerns with the bill uh
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate representative
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
Kaplan uh reaching out having a a
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about this the other day
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
walking through those concerns and his
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
receptiveness to uh you know put some
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
more work into this the the only other
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
thing I'd say aside from from our
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
appreciation uh is we do think that
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
there has been some progress made uh
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
recently in fact last year on the
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution planning bill
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
that you all passed and is now law on
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
the uh non wires alternative section
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
where utilities have to file um these
 
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
distribution planning documents every I
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
think it's five years and include an
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
assessment that they have done of
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
non-wire alternative so there was some
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
some activity and progress made on that
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
but really just uh we do have uh
 
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
concerns no need to go through them uh
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
Point by point and really do appreciate
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's uh willingness
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:41.669 align:start position:0%
 
feedback

01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
01:33:41.679 --> 01:33:44.030 align:start position:0%
feedback
okay

01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's it no further pink
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
cards no further questions we'll close
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.270 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill
674

01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
674
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
FN and representative Kaplan I'd remind
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
you that we need a pink card from you
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
about uh for introducing the bill and I
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
would also remind
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee that we need a pink
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
bill which would be House Bill
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
681 establishing a Statewide online

of the statute which was passed in um B
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry SB 284 back in
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
2019 and that language basically pushed
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward um a docket at the Public
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
parties and interveners including myself
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%

technical issues of this software
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
project were approved by the Commission

in an order on March 2nd 2022 that order
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
found that both the technical approach

working together since the bill passed
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
in 2019 were consistent with the

and operation of the
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
platform I was in the conversations
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
around how this project moved forward
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
and we were meeting we had 158 hour
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
technical session
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
um during 2020 during
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
Co um with the it professionals from all
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the utilities as well as it
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
professionals who intervened on the
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
project from around the country because
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
they had been party to other efforts of
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
this type in other states around the
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
country if we had had the slides set up
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
this morning I had just three simple
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
slides that showed um the other states
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
in the country that have already that
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
have individual utility platforms
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
available for their customers and also
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
the ones that have attempted to do a
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
multi-utility data platform because I
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
understand that for many of you this is
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
the first time you're hearing anything
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
about this project but it has been
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing for the full full time and the
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
governance Council as it is currently
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
constituted under the leadership of the
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
chief technology officer and it
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
development manager at
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
Unitil they they meet weekly so they
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
have a a 4 p.m. Wednesday
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
meeting uh to discuss all of the issues
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
around um where they're at right now is
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
they're ready to submit an RFP to find
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
out the cost to actually build the
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
project it's been speculative up to this
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
point and um once that RFP is returned
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
then the cost benefit analysis that is
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
also pending can be completed because
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
they can't do that until they have an
 
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
actual cost uh to build it but um
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
so let's see the bill is needing because
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
the initial hurdles have all been met in
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
the design of the requirements as
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
established and we need new language
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
that will guide um the effort
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
forward the process um allows for
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
objections from any member of the
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
governance Council the technical
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
expertise utility expertise Department
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
Consumer Advocates legal expertise
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
provide a sufficiently broad knowledge
 
01:40:24.669 --> 01:40:24.679 align:start position:0%
base to approve proove project decisions
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
and to file rate reimbursement requests
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
to the Pu as with any other utility
 
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
investment to be submitted once the RFP
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
and cost benefit analysis are completed
 
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
and approved by the Pu the RFP is ready
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to the Pu as I had
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned and uh my understanding is it
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
only lacks sign off from the Department
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
of energy or it would have been
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
delivered today they can probably speak
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
to that the language that will be put
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
into state law uh that no util is that
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
no utility shall recover costs that are
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
not prudently incurred nor shall there
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
be any recovery of or on investments
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
that are not useful are not used and
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
useful that's the term used and
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
useful that language means that the
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
utilities who are charged with managing
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and developing the maintenance of the
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of this project cannot
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
recover monies they cannot justify
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
lens what this bill seeks to do is set
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
up the technical and administrative path
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
for the energy data Hub once a
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
successful RFP response is in hand and
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
the pending cost benefit analysis is
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
completed later this year it's expected
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
fall I should say that I cannot fathom
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
any reason that this bill would have a
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note as passing it will have no
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact the project itself has a
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
cost and we can talk about that later uh
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
when HB 723 comes up I don't want to mix
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the two uh
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
topics um this bill merely seeks to
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
update statutory language so that the
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
governance Council can continue to
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
manage the technical and administrative
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
decision-making um because they have the
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
it expertise to do so it's a software
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
project um that was the original intent
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
284 and if the RFP and cost benefit
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
analysis proves the energy data hub's
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
value and that the cost is just and
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable then these statutory changes
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
to define the governance of this
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
software project should move forward in
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
the hands of the governance Council that
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
was defined in the original statute to
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
provide the leadership and Technical
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
expertise to manage the tool once the
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
original statutory specifications were
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
met I thought this year was the right
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
time uh for a transition from the public
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
utility commission's oversight to the
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
utilities um Department of energy
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and other energy
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who make up the governance
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
Council as they have been working on
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
this project since
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
2019 there is no reason for technical
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
oversight from the Public Utilities
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
Commission because the project
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
management is being done by uni Till's
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
professional it department and I'm happy
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative McGee
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
for introducing this
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
legislation so I have a quick question
 
01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:19.870 align:start position:0%
legislation so I have a quick question
for

01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
you they've been working on this you
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
testified since 2019 that's six years
 
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.149 align:start position:0%
testified since 2019 that's six years
yes

01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
and I personally have kind of lost
 
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
track uh so could you explain to us why
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
we need to mandate the use of an online
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
data platform if it's something that
 
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
utilities would find useful wouldn't
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
they just do it on their
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
own thank you for the question
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
um the util ities in in some cases
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually have applications that they've
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
designed and um that allow people to
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
access their energy
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
data uh in some cases and in some states
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
they also have front-end apps that
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
people can download on their phones that
 
01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:13.639 align:start position:0%
kind of thing uh what the brainchild for
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
the data platform was that I thought was
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
really interesting is the idea of having
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
all the utilities data so if you're
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
if your town skirts multiple utility
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
districts um or if you are trying to
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
look at your energy usage in general it
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
includes electricity and gas so it is is
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
basically a data Hub it's a place where
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
all of uh the energy from all the
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
participating utilities and uh their
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries in gas as well as electric
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
would would reside so what it does is it
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
enables people to slice and dice their
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
data into information in whatever kinds
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
of slices that they want so it it
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
broadens the ability to do planning
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
create grid
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
resiliency uh uh realize energy
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and savings because you can
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
actually manage what you can now measure
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I I uh was in charge of metrics years
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
ago and when I was in the uh Technical
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
Training Center at John Hancock
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
Financial when I first started working
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
there they said you're in charge of
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
metrics and I was like okay um but what
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that basically is is taking data and
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
turning it into information that's
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
actually useful to people so um you know
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
managers and others will be able to
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
understand what they're looking at what
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
kind of gaps they're trying to fill and
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh what happened with this project one
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
of the reasons it took so long I mean we
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
were in covid when it first started I
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
was on the call for the hearing um on
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
March 2nd
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
2022 uh all of the stakeholders doe
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
included you know we were unanimous uh
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
in our presentation to the then
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um and what what happened
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
was my understanding is I'm not on the
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
go well I'm still I still get the
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
notices for the governance Council
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
meetings but I only go if I know of
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
something that I want to hear about so
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
they are very gracious to still keep me
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
as a member of the pack but um there was
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
a opportunity to secure a grip Grant um
 
01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:35.719 align:start position:0%
and uh like a grid
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
resiliency I don't know what the acronym
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
stands for but um there was a call for
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
proposals and it was a um a competitive
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
Grant and those proposals were favoring
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
efforts that
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
were um Regional
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
grid resiliency kind of thing
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
so Unitil took the initiative and went
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
forward and asked um some of the other
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
states that they're already functioning
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
in and the other states basically in New
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
England if they wanted to participate
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
and I think everybody signed on except
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
maybe Vermont but anyway they they put
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
in a joint Grant so that took the that
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
sidp them for well over a year um 2023
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
to 2024 and they got the answer back
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
last year that it was a competitive uh
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
Grant and there were five times the
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
number of submissions and they didn't
 
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
get it so um yeah so that's that's what
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
happened it it we would have been uh
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
turning it around sooner than this but
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
what what we have and I do have handouts
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
that are being created upstairs which
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
I'll present I I want to speak on 723
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
obviously too because I have knowledge
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
about the thing um is that we have a
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
sort of a full set of who benefits how
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
they benefit user stories
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
and also the original legislative
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
objectives that we were trying to
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
satisfy when we were trying to develop
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for this tool um and there
 
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.750 align:start position:0%
requirements for this tool um and there
is

01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
currently a highlevel estimate from
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
dunsky based on other states that have
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
tools like this as to the amount of
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
savings that we can expect and I have
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
information on that to to pass out to
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
but we won't have the actual cost
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis to make a decision
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
until the fall so we we really don't
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
have um what it'll cost to build it
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of projections out there
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say to you I was a program
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
manager in a software engineering shop
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
at skillsoft and when the software
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
engineers and people who had dealt in
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
software on this project began
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussing how it would move forward it
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
was very difficult because we didn't
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a department of energy then there
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
was no point person which is why I
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
stayed with the project I I was like
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be able to articulate
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on here and so what was
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
interesting to me is that
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
um uh there was not anybody or there
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
were very few people in the state agency
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure who had uh technical or
 
01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
infrastructure who had uh technical or
software

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
software
 
01:49:14.109 --> 01:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
background and so um there was no one to
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
have sort of ownership for the
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
project and what we tried to do was
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
satisfy the legislative language that
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
said that the utilities would be in
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
charge of building it and operating it
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
without a goldplated price tag from the
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
utilities and so we we worked on the
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
software side of it to say it should be
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
done through agile practices it should
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
maybe be outsourced to utility
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
API um companies that do this do this
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
all around the country right there are
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
several and so the RFP will be going out
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
to those people to sort of build the
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
specs um and we will know what they are
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to charge us before before that
 
01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:03.639 align:start position:0%
happens so we actually think it's going
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
to be lower uh than the stuff that's
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
been projected um and I have a back of
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
the napkin on what it would actually
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
result in on people's bills because we
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have you know some information also
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
about how it would be charged back as a
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
capital expense but I don't want to go
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
into all that now um um and I don't even
 
01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:25.590 align:start position:0%
know if I answered your question at this
 
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:27.669 align:start position:0%
know if I answered your question at this
[Laughter]

01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
point I don't know
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
either no I do do appreciate your your
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
your answer thank you any additional
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Harrington
 
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
has one yeah thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question just a
 
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
clarification uh on a couple of parts of
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
the bill on line 25 on page one it says
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
the uh governance Council operates under
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
a con consensus decisionmaking model
 
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
does that mean majority rules no it
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
means if you don't have consensus it
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't go okay that means unanimous yes
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay and followup yes followup okay if
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
if that means unanimous then when you go
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
over to um the second page where it
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
talks about um decisions of the
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
governance Council line uh let's just
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
start with line
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
22 uh when it's sented to by blah blah
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and it shall be deemed to
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
be prudent and lawful nothing in this
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall preclude a person AG
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
grieved by a non-unanimous decision of
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
the governance Council so it sounds like
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
one point you're saying the decisions
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
have to be unanimous and another Point
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying if they're not unanimous
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
this is an outcome that you can pursue
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
so what happens if it's not unanimous
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
let's say it's 5 to one uh does that
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
then have is it been prudent and
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
lawful well I think you can probably
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the consumer Advocate who's a
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
member of the governance Council to talk
 
01:51:58.830 --> 01:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
about uh how that would work in reality
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
I think what what the verbiage is trying
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
to do here is say that if someone is
 
01:52:07.709 --> 01:52:07.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to any of these decisions that
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
are going through then they have the
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
option of seeking relief uh through the
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
commission to try and adjudicate that
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
followup lack of unan unanimity I could
 
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
say that okay follow up but I'm that's
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
why I'm confused because you said that
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
their consensus decision- making which
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
means the only decisions they can come
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
to is unanimously then you say if it's
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
not unanimous any grieved person who I
 
01:52:32.109 --> 01:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
don't actually who who that is I guess
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
it could be any rate payer I guess um
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
can be agreed by a non-unanimous
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
decision can appeal to the to to the
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
commission so I it just seems like
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
something's not something doesn't work
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
right there understand and understand
 
01:52:48.669 --> 01:52:48.679 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um well I think that
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
the consensus decision-making model is
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
one that was adopted by the governance
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
Council in order to work through the
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
issues that they have if they have
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
disagreement they try and get it to a
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
point where everybody can live with
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the decision is but again I'm
 
01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
not on the council so somebody else can
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably speak to that better and I know
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
that um Clifton Belo will be here for
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
the two two o'clock event representative
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
question sure i' actually like to follow
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
up on on chairman V's question because
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
he was asking about uh why haven't the
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
utilities just gone ahead and and and
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
done this um are there beneficiaries
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
other than the utilities if this thing
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
was really up and running I mean could
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
could a just a a residential consumer
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
use this could could uh a third party
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
provider use it could Community power
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
use it to help make decisions and there
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore it would be Beyond just
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
utilities well I can speak to when this
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
when this went to subcommittee this is
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
the first official act that I had as a
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative was I got tapped to take
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
this Senate bill that was coming over uh
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
on this you know Statewide energy data
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
platform that nobody really understood
 
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
and they asked me if I wanted to run the
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I ran with that
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I mean I went over to the
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
person whose idea this was he was
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
working at the time in the consumer
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
Advocates office but he was a former CTO
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
and he had been tracking Texas basically
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
um and there was some other states uh at
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
that time trying to do the same thing
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
which is pull all the energy data
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
together in order to use it for benefit
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
and benefit of everybody it's it they
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
referred to it as democratizing the data
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
and of course the resistance initially
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
was the utilities own the data so they
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to give up the
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
control of the data so that people would
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
be able to make better decisions without
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to them for that data um so that
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
process would be facilit ated and to
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
your specific question yes it would be
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
available uh to individuals and third
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
parties to municipalities to building
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
owners private businesses um facilities
 
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
like hospitals and University
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
installations so anybody that owns a
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
grouping of buildings or a compound
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to slice the data so that
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
they could see all of their energy usage
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
and they could make better decisions
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
about how to improve their Energy
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh in in whatever complex
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
they were managing so it's something you
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
can't do today it's very hard to do
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
today because of the lack of uh access
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
data representative reyolds has a
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee for
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
spearheading this project for all these
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
years um is the is the is the big idea
 
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
years um is the is the is the big idea
behind

01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.629 align:start position:0%
behind
this

01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
project and the vision for this shared
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh universally accessible
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
database that good Pol good public
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
policy and good business
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
decisions are based on
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
good data and shared understanding and
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
right now you
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
know we don't have that for the State of
 
01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have all all this
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's energy usage data is sort of
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
private and Sil
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know by
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
utility it's nobody can nobody can get
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
the big picture is is the idea that by
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
having this system we could all have
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
shared more a better shared
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of energy usage energy
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
usage patterns Trends so that we could
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
have a more informed uh debate uh
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about what we're trying to do
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
here before you answer that question I
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
was goingon to say thank you for the
 
01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
layup and it's a good question it is a
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
good good
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
question but I want to point out
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
that it's a time- wasting question in
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
the sense that you asked it three
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
times you you asked the question then
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
you sort of paraphrased your question
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
and then you asked it again and so what
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like all members of the committee
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I don't mean to single you
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
out representative re but what I'd like
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee to do is
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
think care about the question you want
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
to ask and then when I recognize you ask
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
that question and not repeat it
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
endlessly thank you Mr that's not a
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
criticism of you I'm I'm just just a
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
reminder to everybody that we need to we
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
need to get to the nub of what's
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
important about these bills and the way
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
we do that is asking good precise
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
questions that can elicit a good answer
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
and you probably forgot the question by
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
now but if you didn't you can answer it
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
I was going to say are you going to
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
paraphrase it no U thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the clarification and thank you uh
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative reels for the question um
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
I actually was speaking with uh Clifton
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
Belo recently uh about the sort of um
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
the opaqueness of understanding our
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
energy we can't really see it uh and and
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't have access to
 
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:22.709 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't have access to
understanding

01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
the totality of something you're trying
 
01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
to manage it's very difficult so yes
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
Clarity would come from that and I told
 
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
him that the way I like to describe it
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
is you can't manage what you can't
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
measure and he said that's good so maybe
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
he'll use that today because he was
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a way to say it
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
simply but
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
um data is information and at this point
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have a mechanism to be able to
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
translate our energy data into useful
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
information and uh we have assessments
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
that show that if people have the
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
availability of that information they
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
will learn how to use it um and one
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
additional thing that I was going to
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
save again for this afternoon's um
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
hearing but I thought I should mention
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
it is the last time I spoke with Unitil
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
who's managing the project at this point
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
and they're managing the RFP and all
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
that so they're they're sort of the
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
primary utility in terms of the uh
 
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.030 align:start position:0%
primary utility in terms of the uh
technology

01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
project they said that they are planning
 
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
to hire an intern who's dedicated to
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
writing apps once the database is
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
available so that there will be
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
userfriendly simple apps um that all the
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
different constituents uh and I will
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
provide a document that shows all the
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
different user stories for you know from
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
Individual up to government and P I mean
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
the Pu grid resilience and grid
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
modernization would really benefit from
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
this tool as well because again
 
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have any insights into some of
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
the things we're trying to resolve and
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
the data can help us get
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
there okay seeing no more questions for
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee whoops there's one
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
more representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair um this this bill appears to be
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
best practices for managing a heck of a
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
lot of data um but my question is
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the fiscal note uh Financial
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
costs seem to be misre presented on the
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
floor so I'd like you to confirm that
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note to this bill and
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
that you as the prime sponsor have said
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
that there is no fiscal impact yeah
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note on the bill but
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how or why it got there
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
because the bill itself is about how the
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
governance Council would assume
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh for the platform which
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
has already achieved all of the things
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
that were in the original language and
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
so they would be they have been the
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
decisionmaker body they are the most
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about what's going on with
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
the RFP and all that stuff um so while
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're still going for approval on the
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
RFP to the Pu and they're also going to
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
be going back to show that there's a
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis that would warrant
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
us doing it um those are steps that were
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
defined again in the original
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and everything else that's
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
in there has already been completed so
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's a full set of requirements now
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
that meet all the standards for security
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
and privacy and governance and all that
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's just a transition
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
Point that's what the bill is doing so
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't have anything to do
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
with whether the platform gets built it
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
just updates the language which is
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
currently describing a project that
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
we've already fulfilled we've already
 
02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
completed all of those things so they
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to be in language anymore
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
welcome okay so you no further questions
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
Let's uh find out what the consumer
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
Advocate has to say about
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 681 Don CH welcome back good
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
sir uh thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
record I am Donald Cree the consumer
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
advocate of course my job is to Advocate
 
02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the interests of
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers and uh
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking seriously the Chairman's
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
admonition not to be repetitive I'm
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to try and not repeat all of the
 
02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh very informative testimony that the
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative McGee just
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
offered to you uh I I do want to take
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
everybody back to the good old days of
 
02:02:34.270 --> 02:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
2019 when uh Senate Bill 284 was uh
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately signed into law by Governor
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
cunu that was one of two energy related
 
02:02:43.149 --> 02:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
bills that year that Governor cunu did
 
02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:45.639 align:start position:0%
not veto and while I obviously don't
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
speak for governor sonunu uh I I think
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
the reason he didn't veto that
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
particular bill was because he perceived
 
02:02:57.149 --> 02:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
the potential of a Statewide utility
 
02:03:00.030 --> 02:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
customer data platform as one that could
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
Advance the policy objectives in the
 
02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
state's 10-year energy plan which is to
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
say uh be technology neutral and
 
02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:09.950 align:start position:0%
say uh be technology neutral and
consumer

02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
empowering uh to representative corman's
 
02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
question the whole point of a Statewide
 
02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:17.719 align:start position:0%
utility customer data platform like this
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
is to allow individual customers to
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
share their usage data as it's acquired
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
by the utilities with third parties that
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
can help them do cool stuff with their
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
energy usage and you know the experts
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you all that cool stuff it has
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
to do with everything that you can
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
imagine so uh the bill uh originated
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
with a Cooperative effort between Folks
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
at Unitil and folks in my office and we
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
proposed it at the time because I
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
thought that the utilities would
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
actually try to thwart something like
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
this as antithetical to the kind of
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
hegemony that they were trying to
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
perpetuate but we got the bill through
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature again for the reasons I
 
02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
think uh I stated Governor cunu signed
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
the bill into law and then the utilities
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh actually surprised me by being
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us to try to
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
develop this thing and lo and behold uh
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
I would say two of the three uh major
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
Utilities in this state have been quite
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
proactive in terms of lending their
 
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
technical uh and operational expertise
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
to the process of answering the question
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
how would you build something like this
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities were very protective of
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
the back end of their data management
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
systems and so they wanted to make sure
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
that none of this would kind of sneak
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
into the back end of their systems and
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
wreak havoc with it so we were able to
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
satisfy the utilities and develop a sort
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
of programmatic concept for how to build
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
something like this that would protect
 
02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
the utilities but still allow something
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
like this to develop and as a result of
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
the uh contested administrative
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding before the
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
puc that the original Bill mandated we
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
got there and we filed a settlement
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
agreement that the Pu ultimately
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
approved so why do we need this bill
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
well I I I think that the way it is
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
evolved and from my perspective the
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
reason that it has taken us five and a
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
half years to get even to where we are
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
today which is to say still not having
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
built this thing is that the Public
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission has sort of cast
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
itself in the role of a I don't know a
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a project manager or overseer or
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
maybe board of directors or something
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
like that and I I do not mean to trash
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
or even criticize the Pu for having done
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
that the Pu has a lot of expertise that
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
it could contribute to that kind of
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
project oversight unfortunately though
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
that is not the reason we have a Public
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and it is very hard
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
to work with a project overseer that you
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
can't just call up and talk about the
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
project with right because we're in the
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
context of the contested case procedures
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
of the administrative procedure act
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
whenever we're communicating with the
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission about the
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
data platform that's a form of
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
litigation and it is a very slow and
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
stilted and inefficient way of being
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
accountable to whoever your ultimate uh
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
substantive decider is so what this bill
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
does in my opinion is it restores the Pu
 
02:06:40.990 --> 02:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
to its rightful role as the ultimate
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
decider when it comes to the prudence
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
and used and usefulness of utility
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
Investments and this will be a utility
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
investment if it gets built so uh when
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
we proposed a similar idea in the last
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh the Pu was very
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
critical of this idea saying that we
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
were trying to strip it of its Authority
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
that is not what this bill is
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
endeavoring to do this bill is
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
endeavoring to assure that the Pu does
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
exactly what the general court has
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
created it to do become the ultimate
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
watch dog when it comes to prudence and
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
used and usefulness of utility
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
Investments those three Concepts those
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
two concepts prudent used and useful are
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
the traditional F focuses of Public
 
02:07:32.669 --> 02:07:32.679 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission oversight uh
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose asked a really uh
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
perceptive question which is why
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the utilities do this on their
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
own and you know I found myself thinking
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
as I was listening to representative
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
McGee testify that if I had known they
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
might do it on their own I might not
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
have proposed this bill to begin with
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't have taken me five
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
and a half years to get even to where we
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
are which is on the brink of being able
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
to put out a request for proposals I
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know in 20 I I thought the
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
opposite in 2019 that the utilities
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
would not do this on their own I think
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
the benefit of having a statutory
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
framework for moving forward with a
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
project like this is that it kind of
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
forced everybody to the table and it
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
forced the utilities not just to
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
collaborate with stakeholders but also
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
with each other that I've learned
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't come naturally to the U ities
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's not because they're uh obstinate or
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
not inherently Cooperative as people or
 
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
organizations it just doesn't come
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
naturally to them and it helped to have
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
a legislatively mandated encouragement
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
to have everybody come to the table the
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
governance Council has worked really
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
well and it offers I think potentially a
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
model for how to do other things like
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
this that involve collaboration among
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
the state's investor utilities and
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
others who have an interest in what the
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
utilities do uh and then I guess the
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
last thing I want to address is the
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
question that representative Harrington
 
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
asked about uh the sentence that begins
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
on line 25 on page two of the bill that
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this paragraph shall
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
preclude a person Agri by a
 
02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
non-unanimous decision of the governance
 
02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
Council from seeking relief from the
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
commission as otherwise provided for
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
under this title and of course
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question is
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute I thought you said
 
02:09:20.549 --> 02:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
everything the governance Council has to
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
do has to to be unanimous and that is
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
true the governance Council operates by
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
consensus so no decision of the
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
governance council is effective unless
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees to it so what the
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
sentence in the bill that I just read uh
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
deals with is the situation where there
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
isn't a decision of the governance
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
Council but some member of the
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
governance Council who is unhappy with
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
the lack of consensus can then turn
 
02:09:51.549 --> 02:09:51.559 align:start position:0%
around and go to the Pu and say well
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
wait you know the governance Council
 
02:09:56.549 --> 02:09:56.559 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with my suggestion that uh
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
all of the um all that that the website
 
02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh or the web portal of the data
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
platform should only have uh the colors
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
red white and blue on it I'd like to see
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
green well if you don't like that
 
02:10:10.549 --> 02:10:10.559 align:start position:0%
decision then you can go to the Pu and
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
file a petition with the Pu and then the
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
Pu can basically overrule the governance
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
Council in that instance so it's a bit
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
of a safety valve for people who are
 
02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.559 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the result of uh consensus
 
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
decision-making that said the consensus
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
decision-making model and the governance
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
Council model has overall worked really
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
well so this bill simply uh clarifies
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
and uh rewrites much of what was
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
originally enacted in Senate Bill 284 in
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
light of what has been essentially
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
positive experience in the five and a
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
half years since uh Governor cunu signed
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
the bill into law uh I could go on and
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
on this has been an important aspect of
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
our work over these last five and a half
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
years but uh again taking representative
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
or chairman V's admonition seriously I
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
think I'll stop talking there and say
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
that I hope you uh consider this bill as
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
a useful vehicle for ex for advancing
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the public policy of the
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you very much
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
now you Amplified representative
 
02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
corman's question about
 
02:11:22.199 --> 02:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
corman's question about
customer

02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
benefits and I asked a question of
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
Representative McGee along the same
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
lines so my question for you now is if
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
there is customer demand for access
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
to a Statewide energy data platform can
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
you point us to surveys or uh letters or
 
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
requests that have been received
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
from customers asking for this kind
 
02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
from customers asking for this kind
of

02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
functionality uh the governance Council
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
actually has submitted I believe to the
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
puc a uh public survey that was
 
02:12:09.629 --> 02:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
conducted in the province of of Ontario
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I I know that maybe Canada isn't
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
that popular these days in some quarters
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the reason that became Germain is
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you know in order to really
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether there's customer
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
demand for something like this customers
 
02:12:26.189 --> 02:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
have to kind of know what's possible and
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
what a a program like this could
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
actually enable so if you surveyed
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
customers in New Hampshire and said hey
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know if there were a Statewide
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
utility data C if there were a utility
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
customer data platform available to you
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
would you use it I would imagine that
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
99.9% of customers in New Hampshire
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
would say huh like what is that I I I
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't even know what is so how can I
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
tell you that I would use it so in other
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
words this is an example from a customer
 
02:12:59.790 --> 02:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
perspective of unknown unknowns right so
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
you know you looked it appeared I
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
believe that there was significant
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
customer interest in something like this
 
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
in a place like Ontario where a program
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
like this has been made available to
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
people so you know it all depends on how
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
you phrase the survey questions like if
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
I were to ask you all as individual
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
customers if I told you that there were
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
a utility program that could be
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
available to you that would allow you to
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
hire a third party that would manage
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
your electricity usage for you in a
 
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
manner that would cut your electricity
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill in half like if I asked that
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
question I dare say you would all I
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
certainly would answer that question yes
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
would that prove irrefutably that the
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
data platform is going to be a success
 
02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
probably not but I I hope that was at
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
least somewhat respons responsive to
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
your question well yes my followup would
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
be has anybody asked that question that
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know of well we have not asked that
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
question here in New Hampshire for the
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
reason that I
 
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
stated okay good additional questions
 
02:14:03.629 --> 02:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Cree for
 
02:14:08.549 --> 02:14:08.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to putting out an
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
RFP uh do you can you give us any more
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
information on the timeline for when it
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
might go out and when proposals would we
 
02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
would be coming in and then uh decided
 
02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
on uh if I'm remembering correctly uh
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
and as representative McGee
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
characterized this we're still waiting
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
on governance Council consensus around
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the language in the
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
RFP uh and then I think that that goes
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the puc for them to approve before we
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
put it out so it's a near-term item but
 
02:14:46.510 --> 02:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the RFP is not going to go out
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow representative Harrington has a
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
question yeah just referring to what you
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
said there with regard to page two line
 
02:14:59.229 --> 02:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
item 25 you said that a member of the uh
 
02:15:02.109 --> 02:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
Council if they were aggrieved could uh
 
02:15:04.589 --> 02:15:04.599 align:start position:0%
challenge a non-unanimous decision to
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
the commission but in the in the writing
 
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
it says shall preclude shall not
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
preclude a person AG grieve so is this
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
person have to be a member of the
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
council or can any any person is it
 
02:15:23.069 --> 02:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the any person can seek relief
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
from the Public Utilities Commission as
 
02:15:32.589 --> 02:15:32.599 align:start position:0%
provided for under title 33 of the
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
state's revised statutes annotated which
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
is the pu's enabling statute so what
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
that sentence just means is that by
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
virtue of being a member of the
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
governance Council and participating in
 
02:15:45.629 --> 02:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
the consensus decision-making process
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
you don't relinquish your right as a
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
person generally would have to ask the
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
pu by petition to either do something to
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
do something that's that's the import of
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
that language and if if there's a better
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
way of saying that representative
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
Harrington because it seems to be making
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
you uh uh itchy I guess I'm happy to
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
improve I'm I'm happy to I'm happy to
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
have you improve that sentence or make
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
another run at it follow up just quick
 
02:16:11.950 --> 02:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it just seems to me that it needs
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
to be clarified because you're using
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying the the word say person
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying a member of the council so
 
02:16:20.189 --> 02:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
somehow we have to yeah you could
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
substitute M of the governance Council
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
for person in that sentence and I think
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
it would maybe be more precise from your
 
02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't think it would
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
change the meaning representative Wendy
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for being here um Mr C
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
can you um please estimate the number of
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
person hours that has been invested in
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
this um data
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
platform project since
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
2019 uh that's very difficult to do
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
because I don't work at the utilities so
 
02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how many person
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
hours each of them has invested I will
 
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
say it would be interesting to hear what
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
Unitil might say about that because they
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
have in particular invested a great deal
 
02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:06.519 align:start position:0%
of time and and as soon as I said that I
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
think uh my friends at eversource also
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
deserve a lot of Praise so I it's in the
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds for sure uh as among all of the
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
utilities our office the department of
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
energy and uh as representative McGee
 
02:17:22.830 --> 02:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
noted you know stakeholders in the
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
industry meaning representatives of
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
innovative companies and few of them
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
frankly are based here in New Hampshire
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
uh that would be willing or eager to
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
come in and provide services to
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
customers uh of the sort that would be
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
facilitated by the data platform and and
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
by the way uh just to kind of and again
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
at the risk of annoying the
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
chairman some of it has to do with
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency right like if you can
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
you energy usage data is very helpful to
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
the determination of what Energy
 
02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
Efficiency measures at a particular home
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
or business are going to be cost
 
02:18:02.190 --> 02:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
effective and which are not and as I'm
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
sure the community power Coalition of
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and other people in the
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation business
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
will tell you it's also very helpful for
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
aggregation programs to be able to Ping
 
02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of information as to their
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual uh residents and customers so
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
that they can be Innovative in terms of
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
the service that they
 
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
provide followup followup so is it safe
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
to say that um if we didn't pursue this
 
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
data platform that we would be throwing
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
away a lot of work that has already been
 
02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
done very much so yes thank
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr CH for testifying thank
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity and invite next
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms and Dan faen from the
 
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give us their
 
02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
perspective on this
 
02:18:53.430 --> 02:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
perspective on this
[Music]

02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning yeah good
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh Deputy
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Chris Elms of the New
 
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy and I'm
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
joined by our regional policy director
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
Dan faen we are uh the department of
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
energy is neutral on House Bill 681 but
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of concerns uh House
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 681 represents a a significant
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
change away from the existing statutory
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
framework for the Statewide multiuse
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
data platform existing statute provides
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the Pu determines whether the cost
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the platform to be recovered by
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
customers is unreasonable and not in the
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
public interest and then statute by
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
Statute would be able to direct the
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
department of energy to defer
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
implementation of the platform should
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
the Pu make that
 
02:19:47.549 --> 02:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
determination uh this bill removes that
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
ability it shifts approval away from the
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
Pu and gives fiscal authority to the
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
data platform governance Council if this
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
bill were adopted the governance Council
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
which is a non-public entity by their
 
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
own bylaws would approve its own
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures deeming them prudent this
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
would presumably be a conclusion that
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
the Pu could not reverse upon review
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
this bill approves by Statute decisions
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the governance Council that would
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise be considered by the Pu at
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
hearing following independent review and
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
comment by the doe and with the
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
potential for public participation and
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
comment this bill completely removes the
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
transparency and process associated with
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
that approval in its bylaws the
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
governance Council has defined itself as
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
a private entity that is not subject to
 
02:20:36.910 --> 02:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
public meeting requirements under RSA
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
91a at present there is no ability for
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
non-members of the governance Council to
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
learn about offer comment on or object
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
to any matter that comes before the
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
governance Council and is decided by
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
them indeed governance Council decisions
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
are not public at this time until they
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
are filed for review by the
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
Pu we uh at the department of energy
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the idea that
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
anything ascented to by the governance
 
02:21:04.830 --> 02:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
council members is prudent we find this
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
extremely problematic because deeming
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
something prudent is up to Regulators
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
empowering the governance Council to
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
deem something prudent effectively gives
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
them a blank check and uh exempts
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures from regulatory review in a
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
pu proceeding the doe makes
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations on prudency under the
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
consensus model which we would we would
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh characterize as awkward uh this bill
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
codifies the only uh you know that this
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill would codify uh the only option
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy has had uh
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know to would to to stop you know or
 
02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
to consider something we disagree with
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
would be to fully object and grind
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
everything to a halt by bringing it to
 
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.510 align:start position:0%
everything to a halt by bringing it to
the

02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of pressure from
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
members of the governance Council to
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that that things didn't get
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
slowed down and uh you know folks have
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
brought up things like when we were
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
applying for federal funding uh you know
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
how how devastating it would be for the
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
ability to apply for those federal funds
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
if the department of Energy's
 
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
concerns uh or or possible objections
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
were raised and and we missed a federal
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
deadline uh we have been comfortable
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
letting some of these decisions move
 
02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
forward because we knew we would later
 
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability to review them at a pu
 
02:22:28.349 --> 02:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
hearing that pressure uh you know
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't that pressure doesn't stop us
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
from doing our job regardless of how
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's been and and I'm not to
 
02:22:35.710 --> 02:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
say that all governance council members
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
have been you know inappropriate but we
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
certainly have had people you know make
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
statements like if you don't you know uh
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't go along with this we're
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
going to go to the media and say that
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
the governor is trying to turn down
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
Federal funding right and so so doesn't
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
stop us from doing our jobs but knowing
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we had the ability to come back
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
later um has has made it possible for us
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
to not simply just grind everything to a
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
halt uh at every step taking that from
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
the doe and the Pu now would be Ain to
 
02:23:08.349 --> 02:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature simply allowing a group
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
of non-governmental organizations
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
including for-profit
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
companies uh from taking on the
 
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of regulating and
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
approving their very own
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
project for us I you know I think you
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
know knowing that we've been tried tried
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
to be collaborative to let things move
 
02:23:27.269 --> 02:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
forward uh it's it's hard now to see
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that sort of rug could be pulled
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
from us with a the legislature coming in
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
and just deeming everything approved
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that there is
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
a multitude of information that's
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
considered confidential that goes into
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
this that this legislature hasn't yet
 
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
reviewed so uh approving this bill would
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of law codify all those
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
decisions you have have two data
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
platform bills in front of you uh it's
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
really up to the legislature to
 
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
determine what direction you want to
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
take if any uh but we do have concerns
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh I think you know if
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
you do pass this bill there's a real
 
02:24:05.389 --> 02:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
risk that you saddle our rate payers
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
with a costly Endeavor and you know uh
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
it it might be unlikely that we see
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
broad-based benefits for a long time
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
governance council members have
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
financial and ideological incentives to
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
get this across the line this bill would
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
strip any sort of reasonable regulatory
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
review and uh sort of I guess as a
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
threshold matter I think this bill is a
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
move away from transparency it's away
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
from accountability and it uh tries to
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
empower unelected bureaucrats and
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
financially interested special interests
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
to advance their agendas at repair
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions so we do have questions um my
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
first question
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
is there is a fiscal note attached to
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and the department was charged
 
02:25:01.469 --> 02:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
with coming up with um a response to the
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note request has the department
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
done so yet and is there anything you
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
could share with us sure and and what I
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
saw online uh so you know the way the
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal Pro note process works is the LBA
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
will send a questionnaire on bills that
 
02:25:17.309 --> 02:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
they think might have a fiscal note we
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
fill out the questionnaire answer the
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
question so uh that that should be
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
online I don't have it in front of me oh
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
it has been completed though yeah yes I
 
02:25:29.550 --> 02:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
do and I do have that in front of me um
 
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
and it it has an an estimated upfront
 
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
cost of between 4.6 million and 7
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
million with ongoing costs of 272,000 to
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
416,000 that's our estimate of how much
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
the data platform will take to get up
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
and continue to
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
operate well that's a significant chunk
 
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
of money so I guess we need to see that
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I will um talk to the uh the
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to see if we can get a
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
copy do you know when that fiscal note
 
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.309 align:start position:0%
copy do you know when that fiscal note
was

02:26:02.309 --> 02:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
completed uh I can find out for you Mr
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
chairman okay thank you all right uh
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative Vice chair
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question uh thank you Mr
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
question very simple question since you
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of your concerns was
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
given today are you absolutely sure that
 
02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
you would be receiving Federal funding
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh Dan can correct me if I say anything
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
wrong but thank you that's a good
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
question uh there were two two
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
applications for federal funding uh that
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
have come in on this process um under
 
02:26:43.269 --> 02:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
one of the iig or IRA funding sources uh
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the feedback from the Department of
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
energy both both applications were
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
rejected the feedback is public in the
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
do it uh there was significant
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties associated with it so no we
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
we have not been awarded any federal
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
funding and I'll let Dan add to that
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct it was uh the grid
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
res grid resiliency and Innovation
 
02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
program uh opport funding opportunity um
 
02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.910 align:start position:0%
program uh opport funding opportunity um
and

02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes additional questions representative
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
schneller has
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
Mr RS for your testimony
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
um you had said and this will require
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
quick followup the department is neutral
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill I think you it
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
said yes we're neutral uh quick followup
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you uh it sounds like
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
the department would be relinquishing
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
where this to go forward a fair amount
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
of regulatory Authority and I'm just
 
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
wondering how that uh ties out with the
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh the position of neutrality the New
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature is perfectly at
 
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
will to dictate uh how how these things
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
would proceed so you know we want to you
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
know know you to know you can you can do
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
this if you want to we would have
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
concerns associated with some of the
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory review but um that's that's
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
within the legislature's perview thank
 
02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just a clarification of a
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
question that already happened it it
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
says on the top of whoops I made a
 
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
mistake you uced you introduced this
 
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill I did but it's it's regarding the
 
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact because it says right here
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
the bill does not have provide funding
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
nor does it authorized new POS there is
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact to this bill because
 
02:28:33.389 --> 02:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
this is not initiating we haven't seen
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so this there's a fiscal
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
note on 681 as I have it printed and
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's the same fiscal note that's on the
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming up later okay well
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
when the rest of us have access to the
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
same information you do we can discuss
 
02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
same information you do we can discuss
that

02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a question on the
 
02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
delegation of authority it it it says
 
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
that the um the council uh decision
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed by the department of
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
commission to be prudent and lawful so
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to figure out how this
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
works so because Senate turns around and
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
says you can you can appeal to the to
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
the uh commission so is that mean that
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners have to then sign this
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
as an order or they just don't do
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
anything anything I'm I'm kind of
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
confused here this thing it seems like
 
02:29:25.710 --> 02:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
this non-elected group is going to have
 
02:29:27.309 --> 02:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
at least some of the authority we now
 
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
give to the commission so I would I
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
would uh defer to attorneys just on the
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
on the just to be 100% sure but uh you
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
know my reading of that would be that if
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
the governance Council ascents to a
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
decision unanimously that decision will
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
have the force of being determined to be
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
prudent uh you know by the Public
 
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission when the utilities
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
go in for a rate recovery
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow up so the Commissioners then
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
would be forced to accept that whether
 
02:29:57.870 --> 02:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
they agreed with it or not that's my
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
understanding okay thank you
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:30:05.309 --> 02:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I am very
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
confused about your fiscal uh uh notes
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
and your your estimations so we're
 
02:30:13.269 --> 02:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
looking at two bills and you're saying
 
02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
if we keep the data platform it's 4.6
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
million as a cost and then in House Bill
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
723 if we get rid of it it's 4.6 million
 
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
to 7 million to get rid of it so what
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
are you saying if we keep it or if we
 
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
don't keep it it's going to cost New
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 4.6 million minimum that
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me at all
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh I'll let Dan answer that
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
I uh I don't have the other bills fiscal
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
note in front of me uh either um but
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
again we fill out questionnaires uh that
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
are well we don't need discuss to
 
02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
discuss the other Bill's fiscal note
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
because that's not the subject of this
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah so I have I have before me
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
listing between uh the initial cost
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
estimate listing between 4.6 and 7
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
million and that's just a portion of the
 
02:31:06.309 --> 02:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
total costs related to the data platform
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
um that's where we believe the initial
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
backend upgrades will uh will will come
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
to after that there's going to be
 
02:31:16.750 --> 02:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
additional cost to build and operate the
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
platform itself because there are
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
different pieces here there's the the
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
data platform which talks to the utility
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
backend systems they all have to be made
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
to speak the same language um those are
 
02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
our cost estimates for for those pieces
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
at this time followup followup so does
 
02:31:37.389 --> 02:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm talking about 681 does
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
this bill have a
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
cost we've provided the cost estimate of
 
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
a prudently of of something that would
 
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
be determined as prudent by the the by
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
the governance Council that's our
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
our the danger we see and and to add to
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
that you know this bill would would take
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
away the ability for the Pu to determine
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not those costs were
 
02:32:05.269 --> 02:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
unreasonable uh and then instruct you
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
know that would they would have then
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
ability to instruct us to defer the
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of the
 
02:32:14.429 --> 02:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
platform representative bney has a
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman and thank
 
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the 4.6
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
million to 7 million is that uh the
 
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
total for all the utilities or is that
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
each individual utility and then the
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
same question with the uh maintening M
 
02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance and operation costs uh and
 
02:32:35.269 --> 02:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
then last question so this is just the
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
utility portion it doesn't include
 
02:32:38.429 --> 02:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
anything related to the actual data
 
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
platform that's separate that is correct
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is the estimated cost for all three
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
utilities together um so not not
 
02:32:49.389 --> 02:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
individually 7 million each but up to um
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
and this does not include cost for the
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
data platform
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
itself representative Swanson has a
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
for being here apart from the Govern
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
governance issue and the cost would you
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
agree that the basic concept here is a
 
02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.190 align:start position:0%
agree that the basic concept here is a
good

02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
one the the basic concept of the data
 
02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:15.309 align:start position:0%
one the the basic concept of the data
platform

02:33:15.309 --> 02:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
platform
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
affirmative I don't think it's my place
 
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you whether or not it's a good
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
thing it's been directed by the
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and so we are here to you
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
know implement the statute thank you for
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
your answer thank you Mr chair
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh in terms of the governance
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
and role of the puc on page two
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
line four I'm reading for purposes of
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
rate regulation the department and the
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
commission should treat Investments
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
approved by the governance Council no
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
differently than other Investments for
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the utility rate base
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
does that not give the puc and the
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
department oversight over the just and
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of any investment
 
02:33:59.469 --> 02:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
incurred by a you know data a data
 
02:34:01.389 --> 02:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
platform thank you for the question and
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good one uh it's in the
 
02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
legislative findings and should is a
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
word that says it would you know we we
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
should do that um if you look further
 
02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
down page two starting on line 22
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
through lines 25 decisions of the
 
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
governance Council when ascented to by
 
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
the members of the governance Council
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed by by the department and
 
02:34:22.830 --> 02:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
the commission to be prudent and lawful
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
so uh the reading of that is that
 
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
anything that's ascented to by the
 
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
governance Council would would de facto
 
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
make the the Pu consider it
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
prudent thank
 
02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:37.950 align:start position:0%
prudent thank
you

02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative reels has a question
 
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
chairman since
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
the governance Council was established
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a sounds like extensive pu
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
proceeding and Order and since the
 
02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:56.389 align:start position:0%
proceeding and Order and since the
council

02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
operates you know established itself and
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and decisions must be made by 100%
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
consensus isn't that a pretty high bar I
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
mean isn't that a pretty
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
um give folks assurance that the
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
decisions that they make are going to be
 
02:35:17.070 --> 02:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
good and in the interest I mean sounds
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
like we're guarding against
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just leave it there thank you
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
ask it once so I I do appreciate the
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
question and and it's a good one you
 
02:35:29.269 --> 02:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
know the the the model and it's not to
 
02:35:31.469 --> 02:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
say that the model is is imperfect or
 
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
perfect or anything like that but the
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
model was built in light of the statute
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
including that pu review at the end to
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that reasonableness so removing
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that Safeguard in that was this
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
whole thing was built in the context of
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
concern all right I don't think I think
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard the last word on this
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
subject because the first bill we're
 
02:35:57.269 --> 02:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
going to discuss after uh this afternoon
 
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
is another bill related to the data
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
energy platform but I think we're fun
 
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
done for this morning so I want to thank
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%

681 and I'm going ask everyone in the

okay good afternoon everybody time to
 
04:01:57.429 --> 04:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
resume activity for science technology
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
and energy for Monday the 10th of
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
February for those of you who are
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for public hearings on three
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
bills we will start those public
 
04:02:15.870 --> 04:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
hearings at 2:00 not
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
1:00 from now until 2:00 we will be
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
conducting executive sessions on bills
 
04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
conducting executive sessions on bills

04:02:27.630 --> 04:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
previously so if you need to go make a
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
phone call or something Now's the Time
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
it all right so let's begin by opening a
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
an executive session on House Bill
 
04:02:38.159 --> 04:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
an executive session on House Bill
575

04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
575
 
04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:42.110 align:start position:0%
575
FN

04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
FN
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
which prohibits offshore wind energy
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and I'm going to move itl
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
on this legislation and I recognize
 
04:02:51.920 --> 04:02:54.189 align:start position:0%
on this legislation and I recognize
representative

04:02:54.189 --> 04:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
bery I second
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
that so the reason we're going to move
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill is
 
04:03:06.670 --> 04:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
we endorse the concept of restricting
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development until all the
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
scientific and other questions or
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
economic questions are answered
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
answered but we don't feel this
 
04:03:22.110 --> 04:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
bill passes muster for doing that
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
correctly this bill prohibits legitimate
 
04:03:25.560 --> 04:03:27.429 align:start position:0%
correctly this bill prohibits legitimate
business

04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:03:30.030 --> 04:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
activity this bill could have serious
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions as it and
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
federalism questions because it
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
interferes with furk and with bom and
 
04:03:40.830 --> 04:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
possibly other federal
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
agencies this bill is kind of redundant
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
to a bill that we pre uh passed
 
04:03:48.429 --> 04:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
previously or two two bills that we
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
passed previously
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
actually and we we believe that this
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
bill will lead to a lot of potential
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuits States like Massachusetts and
 
04:04:01.990 --> 04:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Rhode Island suing New
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for being obstructionist when
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to Offshore wind so as a result
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
of all that we believe that itl is the
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
best solution for this legislation
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
future com further comments Vice chair
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I concur with the chair's
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
analysis although I am a firm believer
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we should not have any offshore
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
wind here uh in in this state or in our
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
fishing territory until questions are
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
answered and answerers
 
04:04:40.990 --> 04:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
satisfact I uh support wholeheartedly
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire Fisherman's
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that there are issues out there
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
that are unanswered there are
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns coming from
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
potential cooling stations uh seabed uh
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
disturbances um marine life there are a
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
lot of questions to be answered before
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
we allow offshore wind however this bill
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
as the chairman has said is written in
 
04:05:07.870 --> 04:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
such a way that there's a
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh issue there there's
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the the restrictions mentioned uh
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is worded in many ways that can
 
04:05:18.429 --> 04:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
cause us a lot of problems the intent of
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is great if it had just said we
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
ban it but it goes on to to produce a
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
lot more information and also eliminates
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh a few um departments that maybe we
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't want eliminated so unfortunately
 
04:05:35.309 --> 04:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is not ready and so therefore
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
I I have to support
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
itl further
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative nder thank you
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I agree with everything
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
you said um I am going to be voting
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
against the itl but not um to be a pain
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
I just the fisherman came out and their
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
story really resonated with me and so my
 
04:06:01.710 --> 04:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl is for
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%

itl representative
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
Swanson just question Mr chair
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh still a bit new to the process but
 
04:07:48.189 --> 04:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
I'm curious were there are any uh blue
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
sheets or online voting regarding this
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
record I do not know uh I'm sure there
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
probably were but they're irrelevant to
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
an executive session at this point all
 
04:08:01.000 --> 04:08:02.309 align:start position:0%
an executive session at this point all
right

04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
so with no further discussion of this
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
bill needed we'll close the executive
 
04:08:09.309 --> 04:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill did it go on
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
consent yeah yes there was no objection
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
so it's on consent
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
so we've closed that public that
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
executive session and now we will open
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
an executive session on House Bill
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%

bernardy thank you Mr chair yes uh itl I
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
believe is appropriate because this sets
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
up potential double dipping on net
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
metering and we had both the doe and the
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
Pu to comment on that and oppose the
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill so with that I'm
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's makes sense to move
 
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
on further discussion representative
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman uh as we
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
know I was the Prime sponsor on the bill
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh and I was unable to participate
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
because of illness um I know there was
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
some question about the intent of the
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill and the intent was that somebody
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
who would have say some panels on their
 
04:09:41.469 --> 04:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
house would also be able to be uh in a
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
nit metering group as one of the people
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits from an off-site um
 
04:09:47.880 --> 04:09:48.750 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits from an off-site um
uh

04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
installation uh I heard a lot about the
 
04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
double dipping I don't quite understand
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
how that's double dipping that said I'm
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
not going to die on this hill and um
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'll vote against the motion but I I
 
04:10:02.880 --> 04:10:04.189 align:start position:0%
I'll vote against the motion but I I
understand

04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.830 --> 04:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson just on
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
the just a comment as far as the double
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
dipping I don't see where that's an
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
issue I don't understand how it could be
 
04:10:28.510 --> 04:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished I use net metering myself
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
so it it that argument doesn't make
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%

to Mr chairman uh this bill as proposed
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
represents a broad and lofty goal to say
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
the least and all by November 1st of
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
2025 five Mr LC from eversource uh
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing uh said that while the
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative McFarland
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
was certainly eloquent in his
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
presentation eversource has established
 
04:13:27.469 --> 04:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
an active efforts ongoing in not less
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
than eight state and federal agencies
 
04:13:32.550 --> 04:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
each charged individually with what this
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill is proposing they're charged uh
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
with reviewing and executing varying
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
plans for energy infrastructure to
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
ensure survivability and resilience
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
as this bill would have it direct Mr
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
Lata also suggested that the same
 
04:13:51.309 --> 04:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
activity is happening with the within
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the executive branch he spoke of
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
hardened and soft redundancies ongoing
 
04:13:58.830 --> 04:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
cyber security policies and procedures
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to protect and resuscitate critical
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
systems in the event of partial or total
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
failure given the above the committee
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
whose formation is contemplated in HB
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
541 would have such abroad and nebulous
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
task before it that I suspect the only
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
resulting report would consist of inac
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
in actionable vagaries on subject and
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
issue matters that are in great detail
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
already being
 
04:14:29.070 --> 04:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
addressed so while well intended I
 
04:14:31.229 --> 04:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
recommend that the members vote to itl
 
04:14:31.239 --> 04:14:32.910 align:start position:0%
recommend that the members vote to itl
HB

04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
HB
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
541 further
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee I'll
 
04:14:41.070 --> 04:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
just say I can concur with all of those
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
points I think we kind of felt the same
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
way about about it further discussion
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you yeah I
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
think representative schneller uh said
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
it quite articulately um my notes uh say
 
04:14:56.349 --> 04:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr Lata mentioned several
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
departments uh dealing with security
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
meters operations Data Systems
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
communications supply chains and I
 
04:15:04.030 --> 04:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
forget what else but there was a lot
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
going on already at
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
eversource further
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
Summers well I was in favor of this and
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm really interested in cyber security
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
and where it's going for the state I did
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
feel that this was too broad myself and
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
I look forward to hopefully another bill
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
coming up more defined in particular to
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
a particular uh item so I'll be voting
 
04:15:29.560 --> 04:15:30.830 align:start position:0%
a particular uh item so I'll be voting
the

04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
same further discussion Vice chair
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
Thomas just I agree with everyone here
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
the report uh time is too sure for a
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
report that has such vast amounts of
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
data to to collect in agency to work
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
with so I agree with
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
itl further
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%

I recognize uh representative ner to

04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
or introduce an amendment thank you Mr
 
04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.800 --> 04:17:34.070 align:start position:0%

04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think we're all concerned
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
with lowering energy costs and that's
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that we have a
 
04:17:56.590 --> 04:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund I think the
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard during the
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
hearings was um opposing uh the collapse
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
of the fund and we recently received uh
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
all of us received a bulleted list from
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
Heidi crawl um regarding uh some of the
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
key points points in those remarks from
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%

04:18:22.990 --> 04:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
could I inter interrupt you for just a
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
second sure I apparently I forgot to
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
obtain a second for a motion of the
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
adoption of this amendment so I
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
04:18:36.670 --> 04:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
PL I I'll second the amendment okay
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so now it's official you can
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
continue your discussion sorry to
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
interrupt thank you so so on the changes
 
04:18:47.109 --> 04:18:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to understand a little bit
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
the changes in the language uh in the
 
04:18:52.990 --> 04:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
amendment from the original bill because
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
I see the bolded language it's
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
um let's see it says all pay starting on
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
line 12 it says all payments to be made
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
under this section shall be deposited in
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
the fund any remaining monies paid into
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
the fund under paragraph two of this
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
section and then it crosses out excludes
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
Class 2 Monies shall be used by the
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy to support thermal
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
and electric renewable energy
 
04:19:19.229 --> 04:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives and offshore wind
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives including the office of
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development and
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
energy Innovations then it goes on to
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
cross out class two monies shall
 
04:19:30.429 --> 04:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
primarily be used to support Solar
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
Energy Technologies in New Hampshire all
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives supported out of these funds
 
04:19:35.950 --> 04:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to audit by the
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
department of energy as deemed necessary
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
and then it adds language in bold that
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
says that are inaccess of administration
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
costs funding for the office of offshore
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
wind industry development and energy
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
Innovation and incentive payments shall
 
04:19:54.109 --> 04:19:54.119 align:start position:0%
be re rebated to all retail electric
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
rate payers in the state on a per
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour basis in a timely manner
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be determined by the
 
04:20:01.680 --> 04:20:03.189 align:start position:0%
to be determined by the
commission

04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:20:03.199 --> 04:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
commission
so

04:20:04.950 --> 04:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just trying to figure out it it
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
sounds like we are saying that this is
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
going to save people money but we have
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
an RF report that we get each year
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
telling us how much of that funding is
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
going out the door to help us invest in
 
04:20:22.830 --> 04:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
projects that lower rates for everybody
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
so we will no longer have that dedicated
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund um which you know was
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
designed the money was designed not to
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
be moved somewhere else or used for some
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
other purpose right it was a dedicated
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
about the fact that it would be BAS
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
basically uh eliminating a fund that has
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
a specific purpose that is actually
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state of New
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman um I would
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
also like to take issue with the
 
04:21:05.790 --> 04:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors characterization that um
 
04:21:08.830 --> 04:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
changing the renewable energy fund to
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
Simply Be uh passing
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
through Pass ing back most of the money
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
back to rate payers would be saving them
 
04:21:20.109 --> 04:21:20.119 align:start position:0%
money um again referring to my ranking
 
04:21:23.070 --> 04:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
members uh she just mentioned the the
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
report from the Department of energy
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that shows how that money has been spent
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
over the years and how many uh new
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
installations of behind the meter
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
solar that that fund has
 
04:21:41.309 --> 04:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
supported um we all were told here in
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
the first couple of weeks the session we
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
were shown by ISO New
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
England how much of a
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
contribution to lowering Demand on the
 
04:21:54.670 --> 04:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
grid every day of the
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
year uh all the behind the meter solar
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
makes uh sure that varies dayto Day
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
based on the length of the day and the
 
04:22:04.109 --> 04:22:04.119 align:start position:0%
amount of sunshine but all that behind
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
the meter
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
solar the area between the on the duck
 
04:22:12.910 --> 04:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
curve graph if you all remember uh is
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
dramatically reducing Demand on the grid
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
every day and that is reducing electric
 
04:22:22.830 --> 04:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
costs for all rate payers so you know
 
04:22:22.840 --> 04:22:24.510 align:start position:0%
costs for all rate payers so you know
the

04:22:24.510 --> 04:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh the law that we have and the purpose
 
04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
of this fund talks about investing you
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
have to invest to reap benefits and this
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
successful program that has spurred
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
investment and saved rate payers and
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
continues to save rate pays a lot of
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
money if we cut the legs out from under
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
it we're going to be making a foolish
 
04:22:51.790 --> 04:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
decision further discussion
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
chairman we're discussing the amendment
 
04:22:59.149 --> 04:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
now is that correct that is correct okay
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
as I read it the amendment all it's
 
04:23:04.830 --> 04:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
doing is adding in a carve out um for
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
development and energy
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
Innovation um so that their funding from
 
04:23:15.070 --> 04:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
the RF is not cut am I correct about
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
that you are indeed so so even even if I
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep the RF I would also want to
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
keep funding for the office of energy
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
Innovation so I would probably vote for
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment but then against the
 
04:23:30.760 --> 04:23:31.910 align:start position:0%
the amendment but then against the
underlying

04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Kaplan has a qu a
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I mean uh thank you Mr
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
chair I would I would agree with uh
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative corman's assessment of of
 
04:23:44.229 --> 04:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment and it is an improvement
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
however I just want to piggyback on some
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the previous comments and and add
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
that uh you know by by eliminating this
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
fund and and the projects that it has uh
 
04:23:56.189 --> 04:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
that it has helped over the years that
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
that would also be hurting many
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities many towns across the
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
state whose uh whose property taxpayers
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
would definitely appreciate the ability
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
to continue lowering operating cost of
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
things such as high schools and
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings based on these
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative migy thank you
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I went back searching I I
 
04:24:27.630 --> 04:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
like to parenthetically say because I'm
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
crazy over the weekend I went and looked
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
up uh some former RF reports that I had
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
I have the one from October 2023 in
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
front of me and on page 19 there's a
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
table of the cumulative rebate program
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
results through June 30th of
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
2023 and there's also a graph on that
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
page that shows that the RF expenditures
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
are 11% of what goes into some of the
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
Investments that have been made in New
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and 89% of the funding for
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
those projects comes from applicant
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
investment so it is an incentive program
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely but what we're getting in
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
terms of on this chart it says that the
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
rebate funds dispersed were
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
$39,100 this is cumulative rebates to
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
date but the aggregate applicant
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
investment was 325,000 some on dollars
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
so what we're getting is we're getting
 
04:25:30.990 --> 04:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
an outsized benefit for this small
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money that is being made
 
04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
available through the state in order to
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
just incentivize people to make the
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
Investments work and I you know I think
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's a Pennywise pound fool thing to say
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we would take away something that
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
really costs people pennies in order to
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh do away with a program that allows
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
for this type of private investment or
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
encourages this type of private
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
investment because we all benefit from
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
this private investment in uh in local
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy projects on this
 
04:26:08.189 --> 04:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
particular table the RF rebate program
 
04:26:12.670 --> 04:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
here it says it's by um by category and
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
they have residential electric renewable
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
energy with PV and wind residential
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
solar for water heating residential wood
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
pellet boilers and furnaces uh
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial Solar
 
04:26:26.950 --> 04:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies electric and thermal so
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
those are a lot of times roof
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
installations and uh cni wood pellet
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
boiler furnaces these are all
 
04:26:35.710 --> 04:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
Investments we want people to make
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
because it it lowers demand
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
and you know we're trying to eliminate
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
or shap gave Peak because the peak in
 
04:26:48.109 --> 04:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
our Electric System is where the high
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
prices um Peak and uh if we can shave
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
those Peaks we can have uh more stable
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
pricing so there's there's a lot of
 
04:27:00.429 --> 04:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
value in this program that we don't
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
generally discuss in this committee
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
although I do believe the people who
 
04:27:05.950 --> 04:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
came to the hearing for 224 did try to
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
inform us of the value of this program
 
04:27:12.510 --> 04:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
but just the graph that shows that 89 %c
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the money that's being used is
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
private investment right it it says that
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh that we're making really good
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
dollars it would be fascinating to know
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
how much of that 89% of private
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
investment would have been made anyway
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
even if this incentive wasn't available
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
I mean if you offer people money free
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
money they're going to take it whether
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
they need it or not so there's there's
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
no evidence that says that without these
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
incentives that any of that investment
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
Swanson so I I do concur with
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGee on this matter as
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
far as the return on investment and I
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
believe if the citizens of the state or
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
the rate payers of the state knew what
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
this was for and what you that it was
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
actually going to toward investing in
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
Greater resilience in their energy
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
Supply and Electric Supply and that
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
there were actually Investments being
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
made and whether you can draw a straight
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
line between that or argue about whether
 
04:28:28.149 --> 04:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
those would have been made anyway I
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
think that the encouragement to do it is
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
is there and I believe that uh that
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be the case they would support it
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I believe this is itl further
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative par thank you
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
chair um I've been listed to my
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
constituents and I'm looking at economic
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
stability with diverse uh Energy
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
Services that's one of their
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
concerns uh fossil fuels uh are
 
04:28:59.870 --> 04:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
predicted to be is within possibly short
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
as 30 years uh be totally expended we
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
need something that's going to be more
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
reliable than fossil fuels and less
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
volatile and also many of my
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
constituents have uh voiced health
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
concerns over ing fossil fuel and how it
 
04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
decreases our gross national product and
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
with 10 to1 on average opposition to
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
constituents further
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%

04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill representative Vice chair Thomas
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um uh now is the
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to talk about the uh
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
amendment in terms of monies being given
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
back to our Rays all I can say is we
 
04:31:24.670 --> 04:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
have very little control over a lot of
 
04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of our electric bills because
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
we can't control the cost of the actual
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
energy rirs our constituents my
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
constituents expect us to do something
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
to keep some to keep the the uh electric
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
bills low however small that we can
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
contribute I believe we owe it to our
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
constituents to at least show them that
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
we are doing something to to reduce the
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
electric bills because everything as you
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
know is just too high this is just it's
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
a small way of showing it but it is a
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
way of showing that that we are doing
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
something so I support this bill asot
 
04:32:01.109 --> 04:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
paa representative
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and uh I I
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
would just beg to differ with the
 
04:32:08.229 --> 04:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
characterization this as a small bill I
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a it's a large step in
 
04:32:12.429 --> 04:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction in terms of
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
the detriment to our state's economy and
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the businesses that will be
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged by us pulling the rugs out
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
from under them like this U I also think
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be detrimental to our
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
towns and our municipalities that uh
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
whose operating costs have been allowed
 
04:32:28.349 --> 04:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
to go down because of some of these
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
projects uh I think the small savings is
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
is a is a Pennywise pound foolish uh way
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
of approaching uh and it also panders to
 
04:32:40.590 --> 04:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
people as if as if they they can't tell
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
that the wo is being pulled over their
 
04:32:44.189 --> 04:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
eyes by someone telling them oh you're
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to save a couple Pennies on your
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
bill but this is going to destroy your
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know your property taxes are
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
probably going to end up going up that
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
that that's that's clearly a scam so I
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this further
 
04:33:00.030 --> 04:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:33:03.389 --> 04:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair I I mean I'm
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
always a fan of Do no harm and trying to
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're actually doing it
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
may feel good to be able to say to
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
people we're doing something to save you
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
money on your bill but the renewable
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
energy fund as I mentioned earlier is a
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated dedicated
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund that is funded with
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments those
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
payments are the utilities obligation to
 
04:33:30.269 --> 04:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
provide energy that is a certain
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
percentage clean from clean sources uh
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
or from renewable sources um and so my
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
question is if we eliminate this
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that is funded by
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
payments what does it do uh in terms
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
of maintaining the stability of our
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
position on having
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
25% of our energy from clean sources is
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
that going to also be tanking that
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
commitment because that is what's is
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
still in statutory language in terms of
 
04:34:12.990 --> 04:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion I would remind
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
members that even though the
 
04:34:21.150 --> 04:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
utilities make alternative compliance
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
payments those payments actually come
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
out of our pockets because the utilities
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
recover those costs from rate payers
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
chairman um we we have this comment from
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
Heidi croll that says as a general
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
principle dedicated funds should not be
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
used for purposes for which they were
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
not established or intended and I agree
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
with that so call me oldfashioned but I
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
think that the renewable energy fund
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
should be used to support oh I don't
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
know renewable
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%

on House Bill 224 FN so I'll close that
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
executive session and we have one more
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
piece of work to do here so I'll open an
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 46
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
6fn relative to utility investments in
 
04:36:49.789 --> 04:36:49.799 align:start position:0%
distributed distributed energy resources
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.070 --> 04:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington I move itl on this bill I
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Summers I
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
second that motion moved and seconded
 
04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of itl for
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
House Bill 460 FN I recognize
 
04:37:13.390 --> 04:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative herring
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
well I mean it's pretty straightforward
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
I this bill is attempting to do stuff
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's under the purview of the Pu and
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it right now a lot of
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
this so the topics are being reviewed
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
there and we ought to wait until we see
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
what the results are before we start
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
making changes uh they're doing a
 
04:37:30.510 --> 04:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis of it which we really
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the wherewithal to do here so
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
I would suggest the put this it Al for
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
now and if you just satisfied with what
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
the Pu does come back next uh next year
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
with a with a similar bill
 
04:37:42.160 --> 04:37:44.349 align:start position:0%
with a with a similar bill
further

04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yeah I I hear that um that
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
point of view and so it's a chicken of
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
the egg thing I think um the point of
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
the bill is to say these are the items
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
that should be considered at the Public
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and it it is
 
04:38:04.830 --> 04:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
clearly in the purview of the
 
04:38:08.429 --> 04:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to define those things in
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
statute that should come in into
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
consideration um that perhaps are not
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
being discussed um so I I think we had
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
hearings in order to get that input as
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
to whether there was individual push
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
back on aspects of the bill that would
 
04:38:26.349 --> 04:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
be inappropriate for consideration at
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission so I
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
would still argue that the language that
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
was provided in
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
460 is
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
um uh would be relevant and would be
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
helpful and useful to have there it's
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
not um uh it's not a question of who
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
who's defining what it's a question of
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
what needs to be defined and the bill
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
was attempting to bring forth the things
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that are perhaps not getting adequate
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
consideration in some of those pu uh
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
discussions so it was trying to clarify
 
04:39:00.670 --> 04:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
that point that was the whole that was
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
the whole point of it further discussion
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I think in general it's
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
important for us to bear in mind that we
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
are the legislator and all the authority
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
that the Pu has is derived from statute
 
04:39:21.551 --> 04:39:21.561 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature so if we think
 
04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
that it is a good idea for these items
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be included in the pu's deliberations
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I see no harm in saying that
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
explicitly to make sure that that is
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
what they
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none wh representative
 
04:39:45.150 --> 04:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
McGee well the last thing I would say is
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
based on the conversation uh we just had
 
04:39:49.868 --> 04:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
about what the bill is intending to do
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
and where the authority probably should
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
lie uh I would ask that we consider
 
04:39:58.750 --> 04:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
voting against the
 
04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
itl so I might as well say that before
 
04:40:01.000 --> 04:40:01.868 align:start position:0%
itl so I might as well say that before
we

04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%

looking at what I liked about the AI
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
responses is they give a really
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answer on what categories
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know they outline it all what
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
categories uh there would be Savings in
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh and how they would be derived so um

05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
dfn repealing the multi-use data energy
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
platform and I call to uh introduce the
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lex Lex bney of
 
05:01:08.798 --> 05:01:10.830 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lex Lex bney of
Grafton

05:01:10.830 --> 05:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
Grafton
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Lex bney and I
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton District 11 thank you
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to introduce HB 723
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
FN repealing the multi-use energy data
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
platform which is covered in RSA 37850
 
05:01:27.958 --> 05:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
platform which is covered in RSA 37850
through

05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
54 uh so we've had a presentation
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
earlier um but just to kind of give a
 
05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
very high level explanation the
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide multi-use energy data platform
 
05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
is a very complex
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh and large software project with
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
moving with many moving pieces so it
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
envisions a state managed Central
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
database of energ use data and then it
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
requires each of the utilities to
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
develop software that can feed data from
 
05:01:55.390 --> 05:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
their internal system into the state
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
manage Central
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
database since the passage of this law
 
05:02:01.948 --> 05:02:01.958 align:start position:0%
six years ago there has been two
 
05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
attempts to get Federal funding from the
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration both unsuccessful I
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
was not able to get a copy of the
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
rejections but the department of energy
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
shared with me some of the reasons for
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
rejection including uh one does not
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
adequately build a case that the
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
proposed project will lead to proposed
 
05:02:25.708 --> 05:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
benefits the project impact may be
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
unrealistic and does not justify the
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
Project's economic
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
viability and the department of energy
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
able able to provide more details uh
 
05:02:37.230 --> 05:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
when they
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
testify so the issue I see with the
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
project can be broken down into two
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
parts one part is related to ownership
 
05:02:45.150 --> 05:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
and cost and the other part is related
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
to operations and
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
benefits uh on ownership I'd like to
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
read a short exerpt from comments
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
submitted by representative McGee to the
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
puc docket for this project this is in
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
response to a question about
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders quote the fact that there
 
05:03:02.110 --> 05:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
is no owner from the state at this
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
juncture is a huge roadblock and what
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
will be a fairly complex and Technical
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
undertaking without informed technical
 
05:03:11.350 --> 05:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
oversight from the state leading the
 
05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
project it will be unlikely to succeed
 
05:03:16.110 --> 05:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
end quote I totally agree with the
 
05:03:17.548 --> 05:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
sentiment that an owner is needed to
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
sheer this project this makes sense but
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
I disagree with the premise that the
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
state can or should fill this role this
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
kind of complex and ambitious project
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
should really be owned by a software
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
company that can better balance costs
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
versus requirements to meet Market needs
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Department of energy
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
isn't a tech startup it doesn't have the
 
05:03:39.390 --> 05:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
extra Personnel nor the resources to be
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
a tech
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
startup at the previous Bill hearing I
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
heard that unitel is currently taking on
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
this role and if that's the case perhaps
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need this law unitel with other
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
utilities can and should take the lead
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh the project and lead the project as
 
05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
any other capital
 
05:04:00.030 --> 05:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
investment uh as far as cost we still
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't really know what the total cost
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
will be especially the cost to build the
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
data Hub which is separate from the
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
utility portion uh the fiscal notes
 
05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
estimates the cost for for just the
 
05:04:14.430 --> 05:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
utility portion is 4.6 to7 million with
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
then ongoing operational costs of under
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
half a
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
million the federal government twice
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
judged the project to lack economic
 
05:04:26.190 --> 05:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
viability but let's say that department
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
of energy hires new staff to run this
 
05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
project the funding materializes The Hub
 
05:04:32.670 --> 05:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
is built and the project goes live there
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
are still many issues un
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
questioned the entire platform is opt in
 
05:04:39.390 --> 05:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
for the utility customer and it's not
 
05:04:41.470 --> 05:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
clear what incentives folks will have to
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
opt in without clear incentive or
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
benefits most people are not likely to
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
opt in my understanding is that without
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
a large number of customers joining the
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
data will not be as valuable the
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
marketing and user acquisition abilities
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem are the better
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
bread and butter of software startups
 
05:05:00.510 --> 05:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
and where a lot of them end up failing I
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't see how the government would do a
 
05:05:05.350 --> 05:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
better job in this but let's assume that
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
somehow we get enough customers to opt
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
in and we reach our useful critical mass
 
05:05:10.990 --> 05:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
the next is is will be granularity of
 
05:05:14.548 --> 05:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
data the massive massive major majority
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
of customers in New Hampshire have
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
meters that only report monthly usage
 
05:05:20.670 --> 05:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
totals and not the better Ami Smart
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
Meters that provide hourly data so is
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
the limited data still valuable enough
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
to entice participation and thus cover
 
05:05:30.310 --> 05:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of the platform uh that's an
 
05:05:30.320 --> 05:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
the cost of the platform uh that's an
open

05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
open
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
question if there are business customers
 
05:05:35.670 --> 05:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for this level of data
 
05:05:37.868 --> 05:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
then presumably they could just fund the
 
05:05:41.070 --> 05:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
project now uh um as an example from
 
05:05:41.080 --> 05:05:41.948 align:start position:0%
project now uh um as an example from
another

05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
department the Secretary of State office
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
last month put out an RFP for a um a
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
registration system which reads quote
 
05:05:53.070 --> 05:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
the state does not have funds available
 
05:05:55.150 --> 05:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
for this project funds shall be
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
generated through an appropriate
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
registration and annual fee which
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
vendors shall address in their response
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
end quote as a taxpayer this is the best
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
RFP I've ever read and I like this
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
approach if the project is economically
 
05:06:09.910 --> 05:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
viable let the market figure how to
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
build it and fund it the state can
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
oversee it at arms length and endorse it
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
when it's up and running the same could
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
be done for this data
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
platform last point on the data Hub
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
itself before I wrap up I'm a customer
 
05:06:24.910 --> 05:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
customer of New Hampshire co-op and they
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
provide a portal where I can log in to
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
view hourly usage data this all works
 
05:06:31.150 --> 05:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
without a Statewide data Hub and as a
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
customer I don't see why I would opt in
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
to additionally share my data with
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
another database or want to pay to build
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
out such a database it may be reasonable
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
to have rate payers cover the cost to
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
upgrade the utilities internal systems
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
to provide similar experience as New
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op and each utility can
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
make that case to the Pu on the other
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
hand the Statewide data Hub seems
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
primarily geared towards business and
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
organizations and so they should cover
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
that cost not the rate
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
payers I know people have put a lot of
 
05:07:02.590 --> 05:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
effort into this project and I'm sorry
 
05:07:04.350 --> 05:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
to be the bearer of bad news but to
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
quote the fed this project is just not
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
economically viable it's best that we
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
cut our losses now and and concentrate
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
on areas where the department of energy
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
and the utilities are more aligned to
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
make progress on clearer goals such as
 
05:07:17.948 --> 05:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
modernizing their internal software and
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
upgrading to Ami
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
meters once a significant amount of
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
useful data actually exists and enough
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
businesses are willing to pay for it I
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe the market will provide
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
solutions to this problem more
 
05:07:31.230 --> 05:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
efficiently without legislation in
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion if this repeal passes this is
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
where we may go next one last year
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts passed a bill to require
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
the utilities to build out a similar
 
05:07:39.160 --> 05:07:40.270 align:start position:0%
the utilities to build out a similar
project

05:07:40.270 --> 05:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:07:42.190 --> 05:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to have a bigger state
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
with deeper Pockets lead the way on this
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
two before we spend money on more
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
software projects we need to assess the
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
existing software mod modernization
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
efforts at each utility some of you may
 
05:07:55.230 --> 05:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
recall last term there was a buil to
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
change net meeting rebate from annual to
 
05:08:00.070 --> 05:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
semiannual and one of the utilities
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
testified that it could take as much as
 
05:08:03.150 --> 05:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
a million dollars to implement this
 
05:08:05.708 --> 05:08:05.718 align:start position:0%
accounting change why is that I'll be
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
willing to sponsor legislation to dig
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
into this issue and the general issue of
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
software modernization at
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
utilities and lastly we need to have a
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
lot more data to justify the expense of
 
05:08:18.548 --> 05:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
building a data platform how do we
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize utilities to
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
cost-effectively upgrade to Ami metering
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
so that there is data to put on a
 
05:08:26.190 --> 05:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
platform thank you and I will take
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you excellent bill in
 
05:08:34.110 --> 05:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
introduction I appreciate you doing that
 
05:08:36.750 --> 05:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of good work there questions from
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
the committee representative McGee has a
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative bery for taking my
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
question so you um I think you covered a
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
lot of things that one would cover if
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
they were sort of on the outside looking
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
in right so my question is do you have
 
05:08:57.788 --> 05:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
any insights into the uh expertise or
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
Talent levels of the members of the
 
05:09:00.510 --> 05:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
governance Council and the people that
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
have been involved in developing the
 
05:09:04.868 --> 05:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
solution I do
 
05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
not so followup followup I guess the
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
question question would be I you you
 
05:09:12.030 --> 05:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned several things that you
 
05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
thought should be considered and I I
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
guess my question would be do you have
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
any information that they have not been
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
considered in other
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
words how do you reach your conclusions
 
05:09:27.788 --> 05:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
about how the
 
05:09:30.590 --> 05:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
project has been
 
05:09:33.390 --> 05:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
run I don't recall making any
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
conclusions about how the project is run
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
well you may I respond go ahead clarify
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
your question clarify so you mentioned
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you had heard about um the federal
 
05:09:50.670 --> 05:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
government rejecting the the regional
 
05:09:52.590 --> 05:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
plan that was submitted for the grip
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
Grant and you
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
quoted uh a a phrase from the denial and
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
used it to infer that there was
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
something that wouldn't work about the
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
program or that it was non economically
 
05:10:10.990 --> 05:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
viable I think is what what you said um
 
05:10:13.230 --> 05:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
so I just wonder H how much information
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
you have about that in order to make
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
that allegation against the data I'm
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
told so representative can you give us a
 
05:10:29.788 --> 05:10:29.798 align:start position:0%
little uh a bit about your background in
 
05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
software development and uh working for
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
startups Etc so I've been a software
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
developer for 25 years now I worked for
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh for federal government contractor for
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
10 years and then for
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
um private companies for the last 15
 
05:10:52.590 --> 05:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
years okay so you know a lot about
 
05:10:54.548 --> 05:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
software development and developing
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
particularly Government Contracting
 
05:11:00.548 --> 05:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
software excellent additional questions
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question uh
 
05:11:03.280 --> 05:11:04.070 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question uh
Wendy

05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
Wendy
 
05:11:04.080 --> 05:11:06.390 align:start position:0%
Wendy
Thomas

05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
05:11:09.868 --> 05:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
is okay um
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
several times you quoted um the the feds
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
in denying this or saying something uh
 
05:11:19.230 --> 05:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
about this program could you please
 
05:11:21.708 --> 05:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
provide pointers or printouts of those
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
objections so that we can verify them
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
and check the context in which they were
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
made I would love to except I could not
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
get them myself I my understanding is
 
05:11:33.150 --> 05:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
they're confidential so
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
followup followup then how on Earth did
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
you how are you able to quote them if
 
05:11:41.788 --> 05:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
you have wer I was given some excerpts
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
from or or explanations of what was in
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
them in the
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
rejection Department of
 
05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
energy we will be hearing from the
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
Department shortly so you can ask
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:11:58.510 --> 05:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
there representative Swanson has a
 
05:12:01.150 --> 05:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair and
 
05:12:04.350 --> 05:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bry
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh good discussion and uh but it I
 
05:12:12.670 --> 05:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
having trouble are you saying that to
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goal of providing a
 
05:12:16.000 --> 05:12:17.310 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goal of providing a
publicly

05:12:17.310 --> 05:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh uh data capability which
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know data is probably individually
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
managed by the utilities but this would
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
be a comprehensive state level public
 
05:12:31.788 --> 05:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
one but that somehow this would be
 
05:12:34.590 --> 05:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
better done by a software startup why
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
would a St software startup have the
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
initiative or the s of to do this on
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
their own sure so uh just to
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
differentiate um from a customer's
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
perspective let's say Unitil or or New
 
05:12:50.430 --> 05:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op or or ever Source when
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
you log in to your portal you get some
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
information there so that part is done
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
by the utility themselves and in the
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
case of New Hampshire co-op they
 
05:13:01.708 --> 05:13:01.718 align:start position:0%
actually give you your hourly usage data
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
on on their online portal um so that
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
part makes sense for the utilities to
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
make the case to to the Pu and and and
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
build it out or upgrade or whatever um
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
with the the data Hub that's more of a
 
05:13:16.788 --> 05:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
business focused solution because it's
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
taking the data that each utility has
 
05:13:21.390 --> 05:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
and then packaging it or aggregating it
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
or providing it uh more for for
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
businesses and so I think it makes sense
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
that that part is built in a way that's
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
most economical by a com for-profit
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
company that can do it efficiently and
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
and produce just the the data that's
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
needed by the market followup followup
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh you're saying it could be done more
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
efficiently but why would anybody do it
 
05:13:46.480 --> 05:13:48.670 align:start position:0%
efficiently but why would anybody do it
at

05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:51.628 --> 05:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
all so my understanding is that there is
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
a market for this data that there are
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
companies who who want to know um usage
 
05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
in in order for example to make
 
05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
proposals on projects and things like
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's the whole reason for
 
05:14:04.430 --> 05:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
this for this uh project is that there
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
is a uh a market for it it's just the
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
question is how much it cost and who
 
05:14:11.708 --> 05:14:11.718 align:start position:0%
will pay for it thank you thank you Mr
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
chair representative Kaplan has a
 
05:14:16.110 --> 05:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:14:19.470 --> 05:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
you m thank you representative Bry um so
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
I understand that there's a market for
 
05:14:22.910 --> 05:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
this and that perhaps a startup would be
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
a good a good place to start for that
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
but why why do you object to the state
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
acting as an incentivize to bring that
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
on if if such a data Hub such a service
 
05:14:35.110 --> 05:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to the state as well
 
05:14:37.150 --> 05:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
and to all rate
 
05:14:39.070 --> 05:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
paays U thank you for that question
 
05:14:41.788 --> 05:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
question I I think I don't object to the
 
05:14:44.830 --> 05:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
state incentivizing it I would object to
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
um it having unknown cost and then
 
05:14:52.590 --> 05:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.990 --> 05:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
payers representative Corman has a
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative B you familiar with the
 
05:15:03.070 --> 05:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
dunsky study on this that uh says that
 
05:15:05.310 --> 05:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh they estimate uh just under a a
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
mid-case scenario that after 5 years the
 
05:15:10.390 --> 05:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
total benefit s are about
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
18.6 or $8.7 million alog together and
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
after 10 years uh
 
05:15:20.670 --> 05:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
62.2 million alog together that seems
 
05:15:23.948 --> 05:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
like a lot of benefit and um a lot more
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
than the cost of the project I'm not
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
really sure how that who that benefit is
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
to is it to the customers the rate
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
payers themselves or to the businesses
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
or um it it's to everybody together all
 
05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
all the utilities the customers the
 
05:15:42.750 --> 05:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
businesses the um uh third parties
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
aggregators everybody all
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
together and I think I think that that
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
probably combines the the portal that
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
each utility has and the data Hub and so
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
my argument is that the the the portals
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
provided by the utilities is useful and
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
I think utility each utility can make
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
the case just as uh New Hampshire Coop
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
was able to do it on their own um so
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that probably also provides a
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
utility and that's probably included in
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
the percentage so how would you split
 
05:16:13.948 --> 05:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
off what benefit is for the customers
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
and their utility versus the data
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
platform itself is there a split there
 
05:16:21.040 --> 05:16:22.510 align:start position:0%
platform itself is there a split there
representative

05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you yeah I'm just realizing
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
that you know this is the difference
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
between having been involved with this
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
for a really long time where all these
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions have been answered and having
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
somebody come to it new and ask all the
 
05:16:40.270 --> 05:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
questions again um so uh I just wanted
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
to um point out on the dunsky study what
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
we have so far which can't be completed
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the cost back from
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
the rfps to actually do a an accurate
 
05:16:54.788 --> 05:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
quantifiable cost benefit analysis um
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
they do show a graph and they break down
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
all the details and I did provide you
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
guys with a handout on the how the dunky
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
um benefits break out um but the primary
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh residential and Commercial rate
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
payers so um that's the discussions
 
05:17:18.350 --> 05:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
around who benefits from this and what
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
kind of projects would create the value
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to achieve those those
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
have been those have been sort
 
05:17:29.708 --> 05:17:29.718 align:start position:0%
of revolving in this group for a long
 
05:17:30.990 --> 05:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
time they don't want to just build
 
05:17:34.270 --> 05:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
something to build it so um so my
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
question is did you get a chance to look
 
05:17:40.030 --> 05:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
at the handout that I gave you uh on the
 
05:17:40.040 --> 05:17:41.070 align:start position:0%
at the handout that I gave you uh on the
questions

05:17:41.070 --> 05:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:17:43.470 --> 05:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
around uh
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
quantifying how having an entire set of
 
05:17:48.030 --> 05:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
completed technical requirements
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
including user stories refined project
 
05:17:53.590 --> 05:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
scope and standard data model for the
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide energy data Hub prior to going
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
to RFP what kind of an impact that would
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
have on costs and I think because of
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
your area of expertise you might be able
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
to uh comment on that too if you have
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
all those things defined before you go
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
forward so well they were just passed
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
out uh momentarily so I I have not had a
 
05:18:14.310 --> 05:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
chance to look at them that makes
 
05:18:17.830 --> 05:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
perfect sense thank you may I follow up
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
yes follow up okay so um one of the
 
05:18:23.548 --> 05:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
other things you did mention is that you
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be best if a
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
software company was handling um the
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
project and again the the governance
 
05:18:34.470 --> 05:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
Council and the folks that intervened on
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the project came to that conclusion as
 
05:18:38.548 --> 05:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
well so I just wanted to let you know
 
05:18:38.558 --> 05:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
well so I just wanted to let you know
that

05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
um that the way that I mentioned earlier
 
05:18:51.548 --> 05:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.750 --> 05:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
the we didn't want the utilities to be
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
building it and then telling us what
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
they spent because we didn't want to
 
05:19:02.830 --> 05:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
incur goldplated costs and so the way
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's been managed is that the IT staff
 
05:19:08.110 --> 05:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
at one of the utilities has taken on The
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
Lion Share of being the management for
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
pulling together the RFP but they are
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
planning to Outsource to a company that
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
does utility data work to incur the the
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
lowest possible cost for a set of
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that are done so um can you
 
05:19:26.670 --> 05:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
comment on whether that's the least
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
expensive way to go we've also asked
 
05:19:31.548 --> 05:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
that it be run as an agile project to
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
again keep the cost
 
05:19:36.510 --> 05:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
low thank you for that so as I gave the
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
example of the Secretary of State where
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
they put up an RFP uh that's asking
 
05:19:44.430 --> 05:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
software companies to or you know uh
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
businesses to bid and provide both the
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
solution and then how they will fund the
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
solution from the fees and and the
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
entire cycle so in that case um they
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
just have to list what their
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
requirements are and then the business
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
would build the software figure out how
 
05:20:04.030 --> 05:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for it and then the the
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
government at Arms link would manage it
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and endorse it and it's seems like
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a good fit for something
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
like this that's uh mostly targeted at
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
businesses representative Bernardi has a
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so you may have just answered
 
05:20:24.190 --> 05:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
the question but I said this is targeted
 
05:20:26.670 --> 05:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
businesses because I'm listening to all
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
this we're going to build out this
 
05:20:32.830 --> 05:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
big computer software thingy that's
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to provide benefits to us I have
 
05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
no idea what benefits you're going to
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
provide me as a as a retail customer of
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
electricity I I I have no concept of
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about so what are
 
05:20:47.470 --> 05:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
these benefits that I'm going to get out
 
05:20:47.480 --> 05:20:48.750 align:start position:0%
these benefits that I'm going to get out
of

05:20:48.750 --> 05:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:20:50.948 --> 05:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
this thank you for that question so just
 
05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
as an example if uh if you are a New
 
05:20:56.190 --> 05:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op member uh when you log
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
into the portal one of the things it'll
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
show you is actually your hourly usage
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that might be useful if if your bill
 
05:21:04.030 --> 05:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
went up for some reason and you don't
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
know why it went up knowing what time
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
you know the little the little graph
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
shoots up right you can think oh maybe I
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
ran some some specific device or
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
something so it's useful to kind of
 
05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
backtrack and figure out where your your
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
usage went um but New Hampshire co-op
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
does this without any Statewide data
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
platform so that that's the point I'm
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make thank
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
question this should be an easy one so
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the co-op has time of use
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
rates uh they don't have time of use
 
05:21:38.110 --> 05:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
rates but they do have Ami meter so they
 
05:21:42.270 --> 05:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
can show your hourly usage followup
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
followup but without time of use I mean
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
okay so I know I'm using power at 4
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon as compared to
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the morning I'm getting
 
05:21:52.270 --> 05:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
charged the same regardless of where I
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
use it what's going to push me towards
 
05:21:57.230 --> 05:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
saying well I won't use it at Peak time
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
or I'll use it at this time and not some
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
other time so yeah thank you for that so
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
the it's not about using in general or
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
not using it's maybe you have a device
 
05:22:08.190 --> 05:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
that you used that you weren't aware
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
that use so much electricity right let's
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
say you have a dishwasher running or
 
05:22:14.430 --> 05:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
something and and every time it runs it
 
05:22:16.590 --> 05:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
spikes up so much and you just didn't
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
expect it to spike up that much so that
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
that would be one thing you can learn
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
data okay representative McGee has
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
another question thank you Mr chairman
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bney um so when
 
05:22:34.830 --> 05:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
you put in this bill were you aware that
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
we that the project was about to go to
 
05:22:39.788 --> 05:22:39.798 align:start position:0%
RFP and didn't have a cost an actual
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
cost yet or that it had uh not secured
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis that would
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
allow us to understand uh of what
 
05:22:49.628 --> 05:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
benefit all these years worth of work
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
and even volunteer work from people has
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh has brought
 
05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
together uh I was not aware of those
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
details but I don't think in my
 
05:23:00.270 --> 05:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
testimony they were relevant to the
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
making followup well at this point would
 
05:23:09.670 --> 05:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
you consider the idea that maybe we
 
05:23:11.150 --> 05:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
should have that information after all
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
of this effort before we decide to kill
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
it like maybe retain the
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:21.548 --> 05:23:21.558 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:23:28.868 --> 05:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bry uh relative to the
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
startup it it sounds like uh the rfps
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
being discussed under the current
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
strategy uh are actually tailor made as
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
an oper opportunity for a software
 
05:23:44.230 --> 05:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
startup I mean uh you know even if it
 
05:23:49.270 --> 05:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
goes forward if if uh uh your bill to
 
05:23:52.350 --> 05:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
kill it doesn't go forward and uh it is
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
as it is is there a potential for a
 
05:23:57.910 --> 05:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
software startup to make a proposal
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
against the r fees that are going to be
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
put out yeah thank you for that so I I
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
think the the issue would be that at
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
least the example I gave with the
 
05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State office is that um
 
05:24:10.990 --> 05:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
you if you're if you want the company to
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
figure out how to pay for something and
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
build it at the same time they would
 
05:24:16.708 --> 05:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
have to kind of Whittle down the
 
05:24:18.670 --> 05:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
requirements to something that is
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
buildable for the amount of money they
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
think they can get for it so so in the
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
case of the registry database that the
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is building the the
 
05:24:30.590 --> 05:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
fees for the usage fees will be will be
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
determined by the company that's
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
building the software to figure out you
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
know to balance the the how many
 
05:24:38.350 --> 05:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
features they can provide and how much
 
05:24:40.350 --> 05:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
they have to charge and fees and then
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state would say okay
 
05:24:44.830 --> 05:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
that makes sense um so in the case of
 
05:24:47.548 --> 05:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
the RFP here this is more like just the
 
05:24:49.150 --> 05:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
comp you know company's going to say hey
 
05:24:50.270 --> 05:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is how much it's going to cost us
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
to build these requirements without I
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
think giving them an opportunity maybe
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
to say you know um to do the cost
 
05:25:01.150 --> 05:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
benefit of not necessarily cost benefit
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
but to figure out how much they can
 
05:25:04.390 --> 05:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually get for it right like who are
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
the customers that are going to pay this
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
the money to fund this project
 
05:25:12.350 --> 05:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair okay seeing no
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
further questions I want to thank you
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and let's hear next from the
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and ask Dan failen
 
05:25:35.788 --> 05:25:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.788 --> 05:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Representatives
 
05:25:40.110 --> 05:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
glad to be here this afternoon to talk
 
05:25:42.030 --> 05:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
about HB
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
723 uh so I'm not going to rehash too
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
much ground this bill clearly removes
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement for New Hampshire's
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
utilities to develop a data platform uh
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on the bill as
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
introduced um you've heard this morning
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the challenges that the
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
governance Council process has how it
 
05:26:04.670 --> 05:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
limits the Department's oversight role
 
05:26:07.030 --> 05:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
and makes regulation a little bit harder
 
05:26:09.470 --> 05:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
for us um the process has been
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and frequently boxes Us in
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
repealing this requirement would relieve
 
05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
that pressure and give both the
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
department and commission uh latitude to
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
perform their jobs and I'm going to head
 
05:26:22.750 --> 05:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
on a little bit of a tangent here
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
because it's something that has come up
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that and it sort of illustrates the
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
difficulties of the governance Council
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
process um one of the big things we've
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
dealt with is having confidential
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
materials and having things that are not
 
05:26:40.270 --> 05:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
meant for public discussion because they
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been approved by the GC they
 
05:26:44.990 --> 05:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through a full process um
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
the rejection form that the US doe
 
05:26:51.310 --> 05:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
provided for the grip Grant is public
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
information and has been entered into
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
the Pu docket um so that's available for
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
everyone to peruse on your own um
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
however the dunsky cost benefit report
 
05:27:04.628 --> 05:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
has not been made public and is still a
 
05:27:06.750 --> 05:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
confidential work document of the
 
05:27:10.270 --> 05:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
governance Council um so I I'm limited
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
in what I can respond to on that subject
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I did want to raise
 
05:27:19.590 --> 05:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
was that repealing the requirement for
 
05:27:21.310 --> 05:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
the data platform does not stop the
 
05:27:23.548 --> 05:27:23.558 align:start position:0%
utilities from going about this project
 
05:27:26.430 --> 05:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
and developing one on their own um if
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
the utilities can make a real business
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
case for this and say who will benefit
 
05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
and and how much they will benefit for
 
05:27:36.510 --> 05:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
it uh they're free to make that claim in
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
front of the Pu and and even undergo
 
05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
this project with the spills passage um
 
05:27:46.390 --> 05:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
but they will have to make sure that
 
05:27:48.190 --> 05:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
they make the benefits clear when they
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
do that and there's real concern that
 
05:27:52.990 --> 05:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to you know the the
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
data platform has to talk to the
 
05:27:56.670 --> 05:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
utilities backend systems which means
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities need to spend Millions on
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
upgrades they need to then spend more on
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
the data platform itself um even after
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
all these Investments there's concern
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
that the utilities lack metering
 
05:28:09.430 --> 05:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities to provide useful data to
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
the platform itself um so what benefit
 
05:28:16.830 --> 05:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
then do customers actually see for
 
05:28:19.548 --> 05:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
something as infrequent as monthly data
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
uh when higher quality data is held back
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
by years and possibly hundreds of
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for advanced
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
metering infrastructure uh it's an open
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
question and something that we are
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about as we guide the data
 
05:28:34.830 --> 05:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
platform through the process um whether
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
or not this bill moves forward the
 
05:28:38.190 --> 05:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
department is uh taking its role
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
seriously in safeguarding rate payers um
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and safeguarding rate payers uh
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're going to ensure that
 
05:28:46.350 --> 05:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
utility dollars are being spent in a way
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
that has tangible benefits to rate
 
05:28:50.350 --> 05:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
payers and I think this bill would
 
05:28:53.230 --> 05:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
enhance that ability uh thank you for
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify I'm glad to
 
05:28:54.638 --> 05:28:56.190 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify I'm glad to
take

05:28:56.190 --> 05:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
questions could you give us the docket
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
number uh absolutely that is docket
 
05:29:01.440 --> 05:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
number uh absolutely that is docket
number

05:29:03.030 --> 05:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:29:03.040 --> 05:29:06.670 align:start position:0%
number
d191

05:29:06.670 --> 05:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
197 thank you
 
05:29:12.270 --> 05:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr faen representative
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah there was a lot of talk
 
05:29:16.750 --> 05:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
with previous um speakers on cost
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
benefit who benefits uh in specifically
 
05:29:22.390 --> 05:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
looking at residential rate payers would
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
they need a time of use meter in time of
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
use rates in order to get any benefit
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
from this information it's an open
 
05:29:33.390 --> 05:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
question um and I think that uh the the
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
benefits are in in some cases unclear
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we saw in the
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
in the response to the grip application
 
05:29:42.670 --> 05:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
that you know us doe didn't think that
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
the benefits necessarily were going to
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
hash out um and it's something we are in
 
05:29:50.030 --> 05:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
the department are very concerned about
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
and want to make sure we would get a
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
real sense of what the benefits are
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
before moving forward with these
 
05:29:58.548 --> 05:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
Investments followup followup yeah I'm
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure you know if
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
someone gets this information so they
 
05:30:03.390 --> 05:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
can go in and look at a plot whatever it
 
05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
shows when they use electricity if
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're paying the same the electricity
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
24 seven then first of all there going
 
05:30:12.270 --> 05:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
to be not much incentive to do it and uh
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to be able to save
 
05:30:15.190 --> 05:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
money so I would think if you want to
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
encourage people to say okay between you
 
05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
know 4 and 7 o'clock in the in the
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
winter you're going to be using power
 
05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
prices are going to be higher so I'm
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to try to cut down on my usage
 
05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
during that time that would be a benefit
 
05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
but without that time of use rates I
 
05:30:29.948 --> 05:30:29.958 align:start position:0%
don't see how you're going to
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
residential customers going to get
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
it I agree with your
 
05:30:39.070 --> 05:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
perspective further discussion or
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative Corman thank
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr ban um
 
05:30:46.948 --> 05:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we have a little bit of
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
a chicken and egg problem here right
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
there's without Ami meters you can't get
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
time of use and why would you want time
 
05:30:57.150 --> 05:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
of use if you don't have an Ami meter
 
05:31:00.030 --> 05:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering does the department have a
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion as to how to break this Log
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
Jam well it's a slightly different
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
question than the having to do with the
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
data platform um Ami rollout plans are
 
05:31:12.910 --> 05:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
being developed by the the state's
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
utilities but they are early um I know
 
05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
unil has has extensive Ami deployment
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
but the other utilities uh not as much
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
and have not made public their plans to
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:31.788 --> 05:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
time followup so so in other words the
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
department does not have a suggestion
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
about that I'm just verifying uh we do
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
not I don't think I don't have a
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
position on Ami roll out for the
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
department at this
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
time representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
05:31:50.670 --> 05:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um you didn't you didn't
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
State directly but I'm going to go out
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
on a limb and say that the doe is
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
neutral on this
 
05:32:00.270 --> 05:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
bill um but my question is um again I'm
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note and you have
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
put 4.6 million to 7 million for
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't even exist right
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
now so I'm going to ask the department
 
05:32:15.788 --> 05:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
of educa of um energy to please provide
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
us with documentation that breaks that
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
down so that we can understand where you
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
got those numbers because it kind of
 
05:32:23.230 --> 05:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
feels like you pulled them
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that you came up with them
 
05:32:28.470 --> 05:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
spontaneously thank
 
05:32:31.750 --> 05:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
you I will follow up on
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
that additional questions representative
 
05:32:37.948 --> 05:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair I have so so
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
many I've been scribbling um the first
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
one I'd like to ask you is is you
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you thought that this
 
05:32:48.030 --> 05:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
bill would go a long way to providing
 
05:32:50.190 --> 05:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
benefit for customers as part of your
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
closing statement and what I'm trying to
 
05:32:55.390 --> 05:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
figure out is how it makes sense for us
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
to wait five and a half years of of work
 
05:33:01.868 --> 05:33:01.878 align:start position:0%
and not get a cost benefit analysis
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
before we make this kind of you know
 
05:33:06.670 --> 05:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
drastic change so H how can it be
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
beneficial to people if we don't yet
 
05:33:10.110 --> 05:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
know what the benefits are we and we're
 
05:33:11.788 --> 05:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
just about to get
 
05:33:14.070 --> 05:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
those well I I think the department has
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about what those benefits may
 
05:33:20.270 --> 05:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
be and and
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
the I I I can't sit here and justify
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that were were made in the
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
past but I I think right now I I look at
 
05:33:33.548 --> 05:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
taking away the uh need for it and sort
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the legislative need for for the data
 
05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
platform and restoring the
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory roles of of traditional
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
Prudence review um as as something that
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial from the
 
05:33:46.798 --> 05:33:49.310 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial from the
Department's

05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
perspective followup and the followup
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be are you familiar with the user
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
stories for residential customers and
 
05:33:57.150 --> 05:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
third parties and CPAs and
 
05:33:58.990 --> 05:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Regulators like the
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
Pu and how this tool would allow us to
 
05:34:03.390 --> 05:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
use the data in a way that we could
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
answer questions around things that
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to solve for a long
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
time like grid modernization
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
and uh even net metering tariffs I'm
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
familiar with the purported benefits of
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the data platform um and the department
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
is committed to analyzing them in a fome
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
manner thank you representative
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
Mr failen
 
05:34:32.350 --> 05:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
um just to be sure I believe RFP has
 
05:34:33.990 --> 05:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
been mentioned a bunch of times that
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's request for
 
05:34:40.030 --> 05:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
proposal and having been involved in
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
generating requests for proposals myself
 
05:34:45.670 --> 05:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that uh they always
 
05:34:47.990 --> 05:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
include a list of requirements and to
 
05:34:50.470 --> 05:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's concern what
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
is going to be in the list of those
 
05:34:55.590 --> 05:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for that data platform you
 
05:34:58.628 --> 05:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
mention that you don't care but uh I
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
guess if if it's left to the utilities
 
05:35:04.948 --> 05:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
will they have a consistent set of
 
05:35:06.910 --> 05:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that they would work to for
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
a data plat form so that if I say switch
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
providers I would be able to see the
 
05:35:15.030 --> 05:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
same kind of information say time of use
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
or is it you know better to have uh you
 
05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
know a state provided list of
 
05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities or requirements that mean a
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
concept of
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
operations so I'm uncomfortable talking
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
about the details of the RFP because I'm
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
not sure what is in isn't available for
 
05:35:37.390 --> 05:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
public uh discussion on that um so I I
 
05:35:41.070 --> 05:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
just would say that I I
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
think there's been an effort within the
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
governance Council to create
 
05:35:48.910 --> 05:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for the data platform that
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
would result in an effective product I'm
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't answer your question
 
05:35:53.430 --> 05:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
better thank you for your answer thank
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
chair further questions representative
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
05:36:06.190 --> 05:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
um so we heard from the bill sponsor I'm
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
sorry we heard from the bill sponsor
 
05:36:11.548 --> 05:36:11.558 align:start position:0%
that um they he thought it would be good
 
05:36:14.830 --> 05:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
to privatize this you know get away from
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
government have a smaller government
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
priv privatize everything If This Were
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
privatized what would be the Doe's role
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
in it would you work with them would you
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
oversee them would you have anything to
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
do with this project if it were
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
privatized um hard to speculate um but I
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
think I wouldn't I
 
05:36:39.788 --> 05:36:39.798 align:start position:0%
the word privatized I'm I'm struggling
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
with a little bit because what I see is
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
more of traditional utility ownership
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
and in that case you know the the Pu
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
overseas Prudence review We At Doe weigh
 
05:36:56.470 --> 05:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
in during proceedings and uh generally
 
05:37:00.430 --> 05:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to uh have a say
 
05:37:02.510 --> 05:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
through that process so that's that's
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
Envision okay okay seeing no further
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
failen I'm sorry did somebody else need
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
to speak representative McGee
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
clarification so I heard this um
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
expressed earlier in testimony on 681
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
which you were here for with um Deputy
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Elms um and you uh talked
 
05:37:33.520 --> 05:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Elms um and you uh talked
about

05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
the the purview of the Pu being removed
 
05:37:40.030 --> 05:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
by that bill and that bill doesn't seek
 
05:37:42.430 --> 05:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
to do that what the bill is seeking to
 
05:37:46.110 --> 05:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
do is say that there it's time to
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
transition to the governance Council
 
05:37:52.390 --> 05:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
having the ability to make the sort of
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day decisions on how the project
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
moves forward without having to go back
 
05:37:59.948 --> 05:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
be to the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
for everything they would have to uh
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
still go in front of them um when the
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
RFP is received and and when the um when
 
05:38:12.868 --> 05:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis comes in
 
05:38:15.548 --> 05:38:15.558 align:start position:0%
because those are pieces that speak to
 
05:38:19.390 --> 05:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
the just and reasonable the uh the used
 
05:38:22.510 --> 05:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
and what's it what is used and useful
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
right so so the the Public Utilities
 
05:38:26.350 --> 05:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
Commission would still play its
 
05:38:30.548 --> 05:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
traditional role um
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
and the fact is that the the technical
 
05:38:36.150 --> 05:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
part of the project coming back to the
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
Pu for approval all the time is more
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
like micromanagement
 
05:38:42.990 --> 05:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
because that that's not their that's not
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
their role and that's not their
 
05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
expertise it might have made sense
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
earlier in the project but at this point
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the project I think that's the whole
 
05:38:52.270 --> 05:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
point of that bill is there a question
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
here well that's I I I'm I'm just
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
wondering why you're relaying it as
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
though there would not be any input um
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
since you're on the governance
 
05:39:05.670 --> 05:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
Council uh that that is our
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of of that Bill and that
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
it would remove that Authority from the
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
Pu okay seeing no further questions for
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
Mr failen I want to thank you for giving
 
05:39:21.310 --> 05:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
your giving us your perspective and next
 
05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
call on Don Cree of the oper Office of
 
05:39:23.680 --> 05:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
call on Don Cree of the oper Office of
Consumer

05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
Consumer
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate to tell us what he thinks of
 
05:39:27.760 --> 05:39:30.830 align:start position:0%
Advocate to tell us what he thinks of
this

05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill welcome back thank you Mr chairman
 
05:39:35.788 --> 05:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh I'm still Don Cree I'm still the
 
05:39:38.350 --> 05:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate um
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
I I I uh at this point I I guess I have
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
too much respect for this committee and
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
too much affection for those of you who
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
I've worked with in the past on this uh
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
committee to really spend much more time
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
on this subject because it sounds to me
 
05:39:54.548 --> 05:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
to be candid that minds are pretty well
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
made up about where the committee is
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
about this particular project and it's
 
05:40:02.468 --> 05:40:02.478 align:start position:0%
something that uh I alongside a lot of
 
05:40:04.110 --> 05:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
other people have invested a great deal
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
of time and effort on over the last 5
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
and a half years but it doesn't seem to
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
enjoy the uh support of a majority of
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
this committee or the department of
 
05:40:18.030 --> 05:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
energy and uh that is a condition that I
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
personally have no choice other than to
 
05:40:23.110 --> 05:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
decide to uh live with you know choices
 
05:40:27.270 --> 05:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
get made all the time uh I uh just want
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
to maybe make three things clear just
 
05:40:34.270 --> 05:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
because I I think there's some confusion
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
proliferating uh there's a difference
 
05:40:36.600 --> 05:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
proliferating uh there's a difference
between

05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:40:41.070 --> 05:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
downloading data and sharing data so if
 
05:40:42.270 --> 05:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're a member of the New Hampshire
 
05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op the New Hampshire
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op uses the green button
 
05:40:48.788 --> 05:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
download my data standard so if you're
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
you can go onto the co-op's website
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
enter your uh member number or account
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
number and it will give you your data uh
 
05:41:00.030 --> 05:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
in the form of a spreadsheet that you
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
can then have for whatever use you want
 
05:41:05.310 --> 05:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
to make of it uh what the data platform
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
would do is go One Step Beyond that into
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
a share my data mode and make it
 
05:41:14.590 --> 05:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
possible for third parties that you
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
authorize as the customer to receive
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
that data and then act on it so that's
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty big difference and uh
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
much as I'm sure it's great for the
 
05:41:24.510 --> 05:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
members of the co-op to be able to
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
download their data we're talking about
 
05:41:28.590 --> 05:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
taking another step here with this
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide data platform the other uh
 
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
point I would make that's related to
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
that is that there is value in a state
 
05:41:40.510 --> 05:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
wide data platform so even if each
 
05:41:44.270 --> 05:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
utility uh goes and does something like
 
05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
this on its own
 
05:41:48.868 --> 05:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
independently uh that does have benefits
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
to each individual customer of each
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
individual utility But ultimately what
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
we're trying to facilitate here is the
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
provision we want to attract businesses
 
05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
that are going to provide Innovative
 
05:42:02.830 --> 05:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
services to customers and so if you're a
 
05:42:05.070 --> 05:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
business whether an instate business or
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
an out of state business that might be
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
in a position to do that you are going
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be way more likely to do that if
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
there is one place that you need to go
 
05:42:16.350 --> 05:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
to get all the data you need about all
 
05:42:19.230 --> 05:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
of your uh potential customers that are
 
05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
going to use your service that is the
 
05:42:24.310 --> 05:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental reason for a Statewide data
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
platform now I I I I guess at the risk
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
of saying things that some people might
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
not appreciate I just want to say that
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
it has been obvious to me since the
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
get-go as somebody who was part of
 
05:42:38.670 --> 05:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
docket number 19
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
1997 uh from the day it was opened by
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
the Pu that the support of what used to
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
be the staff of the Pu and what is now
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
the department of Energy Regulatory
 
05:42:52.628 --> 05:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
support division is critical to the
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
success of this project that is why we
 
05:42:58.110 --> 05:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
made the department of energy a party a
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
member of the governance Council they
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
exercise a veto they clearly do not
 
05:43:05.310 --> 05:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
support this project they have the
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
authority under the settlement agreement
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the Pu has approved to say no more
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
the project doesn't work for us we no
 
05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
longer support it it should not go
 
05:43:18.548 --> 05:43:18.558 align:start position:0%
forward I am totally perplexed and I say
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
this in all earnestness why they haven't
 
05:43:22.948 --> 05:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
done that given what you have heard them
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
now testify to twice they do not support
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
this project I I have asked them any
 
05:43:32.350 --> 05:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
number of times over the last five and a
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
half years to indicate that to me
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
because if that is their position that
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
will also be my position because I do
 
05:43:44.110 --> 05:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
not want to waste tons and tons of time
 
05:43:47.230 --> 05:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
and rate payer money on something that
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
the state's energy policymaking agency
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
does not support I don't understand why
 
05:43:56.910 --> 05:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
we are in this situation after all this
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
time but there we are so my card says
 
05:44:02.590 --> 05:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
that I oppose the bill which I do but it
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
appears destined to be reported out of
 
05:44:06.670 --> 05:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
this committee ought to pass I think
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
repres resentative McGee's idea of uh
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
consigning it to either interm study or
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill excuse me uh is a
 
05:44:17.548 --> 05:44:17.558 align:start position:0%
good idea uh because I do do think it
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense to wait and see what happens
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
in response to the RFP but
 
05:44:25.990 --> 05:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh it it seems again like mines are made
 
05:44:27.230 --> 05:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
up and I'm prepared to live with
 
05:44:29.468 --> 05:44:29.478 align:start position:0%
whatever the uh Collective wisdom of
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
this committee is so I think that's all
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
say okay thanks for sharing that with us
 
05:44:36.840 --> 05:44:37.708 align:start position:0%
say okay thanks for sharing that with us
thank

05:44:37.708 --> 05:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
we'll get a a different point of view
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
maybe from um another member of the
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh forgotten the name of the governance
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
Unitil we heard that Unitil has been
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in this process so
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.230 --> 05:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
you see I push the button to turn it on
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
but I actually turned it off for the
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is Alec Oma I'm here
 
05:45:13.320 --> 05:45:14.468 align:start position:0%
record my name is Alec Oma I'm here
representing

05:45:14.468 --> 05:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
representing
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
Unitil uh Unitil has no formal position
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh that said we wanted to
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
be here today to uh go over and outline
 
05:45:26.310 --> 05:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
what our role has been on the governance
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
Council which makes sense we've been
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
talked about quite a bit throughout this
 
05:45:32.468 --> 05:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
process um as well as kind of go through
 
05:45:35.548 --> 05:45:35.558 align:start position:0%
what we see as um important steps many
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
of which have already been discussed in
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the value of the data platform
 
05:45:41.788 --> 05:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
itself and uh the fact that there is
 
05:45:43.468 --> 05:45:43.478 align:start position:0%
going to be this additional data that's
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
going to be made available uh through
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
the typical process uh before the Pu um
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
I think the best way to qualify or to
 
05:45:54.750 --> 05:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
quantify rather our role on the
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
governance Council has been to be uh
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
good faith facilitators for what the
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
governance council is aiming to
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish in terms of its RFP uh we
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
have had members of our it Department
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
including the head of Our IT department
 
05:46:11.788 --> 05:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
uh regularly attend governance Council
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
meetings uh he has provided his insight
 
05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
and expertise into what we believe would
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
make a uh quality RFP that's going to
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh this project is
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
successful and successful by uni Till's
 
05:46:27.708 --> 05:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
definition and I've talked about this in
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
previous times when I've been here
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
before is a successful project for our
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
customers is one that ultimately
 
05:46:36.670 --> 05:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
generates cost benefit for our customers
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh Unitil supports projects that we
 
05:46:41.310 --> 05:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
believe ultimately lower energy costs
 
05:46:43.430 --> 05:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
for our customers while also providing
 
05:46:46.590 --> 05:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
them value uh the core concept of an
 
05:46:49.468 --> 05:46:49.478 align:start position:0%
energy data platform is that uh we
 
05:46:52.110 --> 05:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
believe that informed customers make
 
05:46:54.670 --> 05:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
good decisions with their energy usage
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh a customer that has better
 
05:46:58.670 --> 05:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
information about how they use their
 
05:47:01.390 --> 05:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
energy will be able to work with third
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
parties and make those good decisions on
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
behalf of their family or their home or
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
their business uh that's part of what
 
05:47:12.270 --> 05:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
this whole concept is about being able
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
to empower our customers with services
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
that will allow them to make those
 
05:47:18.788 --> 05:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
decisions and by and large save money on
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
their energy usage to that end uh some
 
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the preliminary D some of the
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary data that is out there in
 
05:47:29.948 --> 05:47:29.958 align:start position:0%
regards to this project is promising uh
 
05:47:32.430 --> 05:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
that's why this project has continued to
 
05:47:34.390 --> 05:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
move forward our voice in the committee
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
has been to say this project needs to to
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
go forward in a manner that ensures that
 
05:47:41.070 --> 05:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
that cost benefit analysis checks out
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
and that is the role of the Public
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission in this particular
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
situation they are going to ultimately
 
05:47:49.868 --> 05:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
review whatever is presented and
 
05:47:52.270 --> 05:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
determine that this project is in fact
 
05:47:54.190 --> 05:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
in the public interest of all of our
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
customers so to that end uh my
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion or recommendation would have
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
been if cost is the primary concern for
 
05:48:03.868 --> 05:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
this committee than tabling this bill
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
until that cost benefit analysis is
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
complete seems wise uh I wanted to share
 
05:48:11.110 --> 05:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
that perspective and answer any
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have in regards
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
to our role in this
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
project thank you appreciate your
 
05:48:23.310 --> 05:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
testimony so as a representative of a
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
utility can you help us understand if
 
05:48:29.390 --> 05:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are quoted in the
 
05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal note of this bill that this could
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
cost $4.6 to7 million
 
05:48:40.750 --> 05:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
to get up and running and with 272,000
 
05:48:44.430 --> 05:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
to 416,000 a year in operating costs are
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
those numbers reasonable are those
 
05:48:52.590 --> 05:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in the ballpark well I recognize
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
that those numbers were provided by the
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy in regards to the
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
cost of the project and I'm in no
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
position here to refute those costs in
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
terms of their overall estimates only I
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
would add that the governance Council
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
has not completed its work in terms of
 
05:49:08.430 --> 05:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
determin what the cost or benefit
 
05:49:11.150 --> 05:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
analysis should be for example I know
 
05:49:12.990 --> 05:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
that as part of the Federal grant that
 
05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
has been discussed here uh presentation
 
05:49:17.350 --> 05:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
was made to the Public Utilities
 
05:49:19.948 --> 05:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
Commission in terms of that application
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
and that document did include estimates
 
05:49:24.430 --> 05:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the potential savings
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
would be those savings are in line with
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
the dunsky report that was talked about
 
05:49:29.708 --> 05:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
here as well although that presentation
 
05:49:31.750 --> 05:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
before the Pu is in fact a public
 
05:49:33.948 --> 05:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
document uh that would suggest there are
 
05:49:36.390 --> 05:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
Savings in the neighborhood of 10 to 25
 
05:49:36.400 --> 05:49:37.590 align:start position:0%
Savings in the neighborhood of 10 to 25
million

05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:49:40.310 --> 05:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
or there are BS in the first five years
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
um and again so when I say preliminary
 
05:49:45.190 --> 05:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
data is promising we have some cost data
 
05:49:46.590 --> 05:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
and we have some benefit data that's
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
available that says that yes there will
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
be a rapid payback and potential savings
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
for our customers the point I really
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
want to make in this hearing though is
 
05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
that promising isn't a promise I believe
 
05:50:00.310 --> 05:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
that it's important for that project to
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
that process to complete itself so that
 
05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
we have clear data that shows a cost
 
05:50:08.070 --> 05:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
benefit and not cost benefit analysis
 
05:50:11.430 --> 05:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
before any decision is
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
made so I didn't hear an answer to my
 
05:50:17.150 --> 05:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
question as a representative of a
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
utility do those cost numbers of 4.6 to7
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
million seem realistic to
 
05:50:26.190 --> 05:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
you I'm not going to contradict the
 
05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy regarding the cost
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
05:50:33.310 --> 05:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:50:36.990 --> 05:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
chairman nice to see you again Mr Oma um
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
my question was around I had heard that
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
Unitil was considering hiring an intern
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
to create applications that would make
 
05:50:46.958 --> 05:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
to create applications that would make
the

05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:50.590 --> 05:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
data more easily accessible to people in
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
terms of what they might try to do with
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
it do you have any more information
 
05:50:55.750 --> 05:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
about that that you could share with the
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee in terms of you know it has a
 
05:50:59.830 --> 05:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
lot to do with adoption right whether
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
people are going to use the tool know
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
about the tool um so I'm just wondering
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
what the thoughts were at Unitil around
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
that because I had I didn't hear any
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
details just that you were considering
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
it I'm not aware of any specific plan
 
05:51:16.708 --> 05:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
involving a specific intern for this
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
particular project I know that Unitil
 
05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
has in the past used interns
 
05:51:22.910 --> 05:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
specifically through the University of
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to work with us on various
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
projects especially those that tie to
 
05:51:31.230 --> 05:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
sustainability um when we've seen
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for projects like that we
 
05:51:35.788 --> 05:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
have uh found interns that have sort of
 
05:51:38.150 --> 05:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
do that kind of data crunch for us to
 
05:51:41.070 --> 05:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
maybe potentially find Opportunities I'm
 
05:51:42.750 --> 05:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm not familiar with any
 
05:51:44.670 --> 05:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
specific resources that we were going to
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
bring forward here only just in general
 
05:51:48.750 --> 05:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's fair to say that we have
 
05:51:50.670 --> 05:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
been pretty involved with the governance
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
Council in trying to make sure that uh
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're any kind of RFP is presenting good
 
05:51:59.910 --> 05:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
data follow up okay my follow-up
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
question would be I I don't know about
 
05:52:04.350 --> 05:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
your involvement I don't know what you
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
know but I wonder if you you would be
 
05:52:09.390 --> 05:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
able to illuminate for the committee
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
many of whom are hearing about this
 
05:52:13.510 --> 05:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
platform for the very first time today
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
um the benefits as you see them based on
 
05:52:19.150 --> 05:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
the different groups in the user stories
 
05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
in other words could you give some
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
examples of um of how a consumer would
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
use this in order to save money maybe in
 
05:52:27.760 --> 05:52:28.990 align:start position:0%
use this in order to save money maybe in
different

05:52:28.990 --> 05:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:52:29.000 --> 05:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
different
categories

05:52:31.510 --> 05:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
categories
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
so there are probably folks that could
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
do a a more eloquent job talking about
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the costs or overall individual
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
stories in terms of the value are I
 
05:52:43.830 --> 05:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
think of it in terms of uh information
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
is power we live in the information age
 
05:52:49.190 --> 05:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
I personally am an information person
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a data person I like getting
 
05:52:53.548 --> 05:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
information I like when my phone tells
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
me how many steps I've taken I find that
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's helpful information for me when I
 
05:53:01.310 --> 05:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
make good decisions about how I live my
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
life or how I operate my home budget uh
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
this kind of data is on that same idea
 
05:53:09.750 --> 05:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of being able to drill down and
 
05:53:11.948 --> 05:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
providing standardized data that can
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
then be used across a variety of uses
 
05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
and having third-party vendors be able
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
to have that standardized software that
 
05:53:21.628 --> 05:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
will then help them make good
 
05:53:23.948 --> 05:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
comparisons help individual customers
 
05:53:25.070 --> 05:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
whether they're a business whether
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're a homeowner understand their
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
energy usage on a more granual level and
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
then that's going to help them save
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
money my jeep has a fun tool I like to
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
use it I run the little thing on it it
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
says how many miles what my average
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
mileage is as I'm driving at going along
 
05:53:42.390 --> 05:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
so I can look at that and as I'm driving
 
05:53:43.910 --> 05:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm a little heavy on the gas I
 
05:53:45.270 --> 05:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
notice that number comes down a little
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
bit so I'm probably spending a little
 
05:53:48.830 --> 05:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
more than I want to be at that time
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's how we use information the more
 
05:53:52.270 --> 05:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
data we have the more we can make good
 
05:53:54.548 --> 05:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
decisions about our everyday usage this
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
data platform is about that and I just
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize at the end of the day
 
05:54:00.270 --> 05:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens with this
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislation Unitil will continue to look
 
05:54:06.190 --> 05:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
for uh solutions for our customers that
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
will help them get good information
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
regarding their energy usage so long as
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
those are done in a cost beneficial way
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we're committed
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
to on behalf of our customers uh in any
 
05:54:20.310 --> 05:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
event in any project including
 
05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
this representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um this project has been
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
going on for about five years um can you
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
tell me um how has it been generally
 
05:54:35.468 --> 05:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
received to date and has there been an
 
05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
now I personally am not familiar with
 
05:54:46.270 --> 05:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
any internal workings within the
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
governance Council and I don't think it
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate even if I had that
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
information to talk about those
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
particular conversations as they were
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
occurring within the council followup
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
followup would you like to speculate on
 
05:55:01.590 --> 05:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
why there appears to be opposition now
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
nope thank you very much representative
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:55:10.270 --> 05:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned that uh
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's preliminary data that is
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
promising and you mentioned the dunsky
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
report is there anything beyond the
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
dunsky report uh in terms of promising
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary data uh only the the only
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
data that I would cite is um again the
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
report that was sort of used uh as a uh
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
comparative tool in terms of looking at
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
what uh the potential benefits are for
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
our region as well as uh the numbers
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
that are provided and again preliminary
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
is preliminary my primary point that I'm
 
05:55:43.990 --> 05:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
here to make is that we should wait
 
05:55:46.270 --> 05:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
until we have real data and then make a
 
05:55:48.468 --> 05:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
decision at that
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
time representative Kaplan thank you Mr
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr om uh you
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you are committed to
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing work to provide your customers
 
05:55:59.310 --> 05:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
with the necessary information to to
 
05:56:00.750 --> 05:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
benefit them in their in their energy
 
05:56:03.510 --> 05:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
usage uh so that implies to me that you
 
05:56:05.350 --> 05:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
agree that maybe this is a tool that
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
that you know that you would develop on
 
05:56:08.910 --> 05:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
your own but what I want to ask you is
 
05:56:11.390 --> 05:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
how would you compare a tool that Unitil
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
might develop on its own as a result of
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation to something that is
 
05:56:18.350 --> 05:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
like a Statewide you know multiutility
 
05:56:21.390 --> 05:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh data Hub which you know how do those
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
two things compare well not to be too
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
literal but a tool that was specific to
 
05:56:29.468 --> 05:56:29.478 align:start position:0%
Unitil would benefit Unitil customers
 
05:56:31.628 --> 05:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
specifically whereas a Statewide tool
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
would benefit I I recognize customers
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the entirety of the State uh
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
ultimately what a Unitil specific tool
 
05:56:40.270 --> 05:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
might ultimately look like I wouldn't
 
05:56:42.910 --> 05:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
want to speculate here um only to say
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we would continue to look for what
 
05:56:47.110 --> 05:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
those Solutions might look like whether
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
they would be similar to or dramatically
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
different from I I couldn't say at this
 
05:56:56.910 --> 05:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
time representative rolds has a question
 
05:56:58.868 --> 05:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that he will ask
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
once yes I will isn't isn't a
 
05:57:07.230 --> 05:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
major goal of
 
05:57:12.468 --> 05:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
having a Statewide data platform like
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
this um to be able to attract to the
 
05:57:21.628 --> 05:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
state third parties providers of
 
05:57:26.350 --> 05:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:31.628 --> 05:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
um help customers of all the utilities
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the information and
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know just one utility a
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
smaller one Unitil uh do you think you
 
05:57:44.190 --> 05:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
would attract the same level of third
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
state just on your own generally
 
05:57:54.270 --> 05:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
speculation is a world I try to avoid uh
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think I would go down that
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
particular Road I can only say that
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
Unitil is confident that we can find
 
05:58:04.708 --> 05:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
customers okay see see no further
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for being
 
05:58:10.910 --> 05:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
here thank you next we'll call on The
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
Honorable Clifton Belo from Lebanon
 
05:58:16.350 --> 05:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
representing Community power cor
 
05:58:18.990 --> 05:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire welcome back
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Belo hasn't seen you in a while nice
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
to see you again good afternoon nice to
 
05:58:25.590 --> 05:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
be back
 
05:58:29.590 --> 05:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to uh support what uh Unitil
 
05:58:31.750 --> 05:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
just just testified to which is a
 
05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation that you retain this bill
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
and allow the RF p uh for uh The Hub to
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
go forward so that we can actually have
 
05:58:45.390 --> 05:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
cost uh good cost uh more than estimates
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
potential contracted cost uh by the end
 
05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the summer um I first got involved
 
05:58:55.230 --> 05:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
with this uh in the docket in late uh
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
2019 when the commission opened the
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
docket to consider uh implementing the
 
05:59:03.150 --> 05:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um I was part that was on
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
behalf of the city of Lebanon it was
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
before the committee power coalition
 
05:59:10.948 --> 05:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
existed um and uh was part of the
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
settlement that was approved less than
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
2022 and have been a member of the
 
05:59:23.788 --> 05:59:23.798 align:start position:0%
governance Council since and I just I
 
05:59:25.150 --> 05:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I think the
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
governance Council has been uh somewhat
 
05:59:32.430 --> 05:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
um remarkable uh collaboration between
 
05:59:34.910 --> 05:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders and the utilities
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
and because it was designed to work by
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
consensus um we've had to work through a
 
05:59:43.150 --> 05:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
lot of differences of opinions and come
 
05:59:45.788 --> 05:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
to Common Ground um and that was part of
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
the settlement in the docket as well
 
05:59:50.708 --> 05:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
which was an agreement uh to design this
 
05:59:52.750 --> 05:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
to be what was called at the time the
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
minimum viable product but designed it
 
05:59:57.788 --> 05:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
to be extensible so some of the use
 
06:00:02.750 --> 06:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
cases would develop over time um and uh
 
06:00:04.510 --> 06:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
what I can say is all three of the
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
investor own utilities that have been
 
06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
very active in the governance Council uh
 
06:00:12.350 --> 06:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'll bring to the table a lot of it
 
06:00:15.070 --> 06:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
expertise as well as a particular focus
 
06:00:18.430 --> 06:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
on uh security of individual customer
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
data and that's very much built into the
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
design of the uh proposed platform it's
 
06:00:28.548 --> 06:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
not a central database it's rather an
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
API of apis um an API is an application
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
program interface it's a sort of a
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
modern way to be able to stream data in
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
a potentially in a one-way Direction so
 
06:00:41.628 --> 06:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
that it you know you can get data but
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily get into the database um
 
06:00:45.760 --> 06:00:47.310 align:start position:0%
not necessarily get into the database um
so

06:00:47.310 --> 06:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of we we did get sort of
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
sidetracked if you will with the federal
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity we only made one
 
06:00:57.628 --> 06:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
application the first year of the
 
06:01:00.510 --> 06:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal funding uh for grid resilience
 
06:01:05.310 --> 06:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure CP Grant um uh we only
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
went as far as is a preliminary proposal
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
and we were invited by DOA to make a
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
full proposal because they thought it
 
06:01:13.990 --> 06:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
had a lot of Merit um as previously
 
06:01:16.430 --> 06:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Doe's response is
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
available it's at tab 183 it's not
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
obvious but if you go to that docket
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
book tab 183 has that uh the full
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
content of the doe uh response to the
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
proposal um just of note there were five
 
06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
times more proposals than they funded
 
06:01:33.948 --> 06:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
and they didn't fund any software or
 
06:01:36.390 --> 06:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
data related even though in their own
 
06:01:37.948 --> 06:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
comments they recognize the potential
 
06:01:41.910 --> 06:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
value of this approach um and I I just
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention a couple of the um a
 
06:01:47.788 --> 06:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
few of the user cases that this that
 
06:01:51.390 --> 06:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
this offers um but but I should say you
 
06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
know we're we're right at the very end
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
of three years of developing all the
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
technical specifications for the RFP um
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's I think very well thought
 
06:02:09.190 --> 06:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
through um and we're expect to file um a
 
06:02:12.030 --> 06:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
a a report a status report to the Pu
 
06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
which should um assuming we achieve
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
consensus on on Wednesday and I might
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
mention the governance Council has been
 
06:02:21.990 --> 06:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
meeting for one hour Wednesday
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
afternoons pretty much consistently for
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the past three years with you know
 
06:02:28.468 --> 06:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
occasionally uh taking time off but not
 
06:02:30.990 --> 06:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
much as well as sometimes an extra hour
 
06:02:34.390 --> 06:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
on Fridays for the technical work group
 
06:02:36.590 --> 06:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh particular Ally Drew upon the
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
expertise of the utilities uh but the
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
result of that is that the RFP is
 
06:02:44.590 --> 06:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
basically done uh there was a final you
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
know doe wanted a chance to do a final
 
06:02:49.270 --> 06:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
review of that uh so we didn't approve
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
it last week hopefully we will uh
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or or Wednesday um and uh and
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
file that at the Pu along with the dunky
 
06:03:02.670 --> 06:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
report um as along with a dunky market
 
06:03:05.310 --> 06:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh evaluation so that will start to give
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
you a a window into the cost and
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
benefits that have been analyzed but the
 
06:03:11.868 --> 06:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
cost we don't know until we issue the
 
06:03:15.070 --> 06:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
RFP there's very little incremental work
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
uh left for the council to do or the
 
06:03:20.270 --> 06:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
utilities or the Pu or the doe in order
 
06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
to uh uh for the uh pu to approve uh the
 
06:03:28.468 --> 06:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
the RFP text as it's uh as it's ready
 
06:03:30.390 --> 06:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
and for that to be issued and for us to
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
get actual cost figures I I think our
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
timeline for that part of what will be
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
filed uh by the end of this week is an
 
06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
updated timeline for how that's all
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
going to get implemented and I I think
 
06:03:43.110 --> 06:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
the expectations from last week's
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
conversation is we should be able to
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a completed cost benefit uh study
 
06:03:51.548 --> 06:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
um by the end of the summer so that if
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
you retain this bill you can then make
 
06:03:57.868 --> 06:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
an informed decision uh based on uh much
 
06:04:00.468 --> 06:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
much more uh information and something
 
06:04:02.708 --> 06:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
we've been working towards really as the
 
06:04:04.270 --> 06:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
governance Council for the past three
 
06:04:08.230 --> 06:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
years um I I can stop there but I if if
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
if you'd like I can mention three use
 
06:04:12.030 --> 06:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
cases that might be of
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
interest shall I do that yes okay well
 
06:04:18.430 --> 06:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
one um first first of all it is based on
 
06:04:21.468 --> 06:04:21.478 align:start position:0%
green cuton green button uh connect my
 
06:04:24.590 --> 06:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
data uh not just U see my data but be
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
able to share it through an API this is
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
a National Standard that was developed
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
to try to have a standardized format for
 
06:04:33.628 --> 06:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
sharing data um it goes up somewhat
 
06:04:35.708 --> 06:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
beyond that by allowing certain
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
agregation of data and one case in point
 
06:04:43.948 --> 06:04:43.958 align:start position:0%
concerns uh multi-tenant buildings in
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for New Hampshire's
 
06:04:49.868 --> 06:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs or in my case
 
06:04:52.190 --> 06:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just give an example I manage a
 
06:04:54.910 --> 06:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
27,000 foot office building it's got a
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
30e plus old hva hva system and when we
 
06:05:02.830 --> 06:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
went to look at replacing our rooftop
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
units um the the technology is evolved
 
06:05:07.708 --> 06:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and the engineer said well
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the whole building
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
usage uh and for that you you need to
 
06:05:16.110 --> 06:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
obtain from every tenant their usage for
 
06:05:18.670 --> 06:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
at least a year so that we can actually
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
size the new Air Conditioning which
 
06:05:23.390 --> 06:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
which codes require us to size it based
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
on uh the the actual design and building
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
use it took um uh it took the better
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
part of a year just to get every
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
tenant's permission to share their data
 
06:05:37.590 --> 06:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
um but that became essential and what we
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
could see for instance what we saw from
 
06:05:42.190 --> 06:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
that is oh um we still got a lot of
 
06:05:44.110 --> 06:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
fluorescent lighting and we could
 
06:05:46.510 --> 06:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
convert to LED which we did during the
 
06:05:50.270 --> 06:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and uh lower that energy use
 
06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
such that the new equipment we purchased
 
06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
could be smaller in size to accommodate
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that when the building was
 
06:05:58.510 --> 06:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
designed it had more energy use than it
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
has today because of of these increased
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
deficiencies um it's a real problem in
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
multif family housing because of
 
06:06:07.708 --> 06:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
individual tenants don't want to share
 
06:06:09.868 --> 06:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
their data with their landlord and yet
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
for multif family housing to qualify for
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
most of the Energy Efficiency programs
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have to have whole building data
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
one thing this platform would do using
 
06:06:20.030 --> 06:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
standards that have also been developed
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
in other states is allow a building
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
owner to say I don't need individual I
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't need every tenants data but I do
 
06:06:31.030 --> 06:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
need the aggregate Total Building use
 
06:06:33.070 --> 06:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
gas if you have natural gas plus
 
06:06:35.788 --> 06:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
electricity and the standard that was
 
06:06:37.590 --> 06:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
agreed to in the settlement and that the
 
06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
Pu approved was that if you've got at
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
least four tenants and no one of those
 
06:06:46.510 --> 06:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
tenants uses more than 50% of the total
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know energy of all the tenants then
 
06:06:51.670 --> 06:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
they could give you the aggregated uh
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
building usage you don't know how much
 
06:06:55.750 --> 06:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
is by individual tenant but at least you
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
know the total building usage and from
 
06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
there you can make informed decisions
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
about what kind of Investments would
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
make sense to better insulate your
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
multif family family housing or do other
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency measures and to
 
06:07:11.830 --> 06:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually qualify in the program another
 
06:07:15.150 --> 06:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
related use case is trying to move
 
06:07:17.430 --> 06:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency towards a more
 
06:07:21.468 --> 06:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
market-based uh process right now most
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
of the the utility programs mostly use
 
06:07:25.788 --> 06:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
what's called deem savings and they say
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
well if you do this or that we estimate
 
06:07:31.468 --> 06:07:31.478 align:start position:0%
that the savings will be thus and they
 
06:07:34.110 --> 06:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
get approved B on the basis of deem
 
06:07:37.548 --> 06:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
savings there's the trend towards pay
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
for performance which says to the
 
06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
contractor allows the a shifting of the
 
06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to actually produce
 
06:07:48.468 --> 06:07:48.478 align:start position:0%
savings to the contractor to say will'll
 
06:07:50.948 --> 06:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
you'll get compensated but based on the
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
performance that you estimate these
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
measures will uh save the customer this
 
06:07:58.270 --> 06:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
much but we're going to actually track
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
that and compensate you on performance
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
not just on an expectation of savings so
 
06:08:07.708 --> 06:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
those are just a few examples of where
 
06:08:10.110 --> 06:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
this platform uh can be of of
 
06:08:10.120 --> 06:08:11.830 align:start position:0%
this platform uh can be of of
significant

06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
06:08:14.708 --> 06:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
value well thank you I have a couple of
 
06:08:17.468 --> 06:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
quick questions for you I believe I
 
06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
heard one other testifier say that a
 
06:08:22.670 --> 06:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
customer has to agree to share their
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
data is that correct it it to share
 
06:08:29.110 --> 06:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
their individual customer data yes that
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be you know I want to share it
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
with this a contractor or somebody who
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
wants to quote me on a solar system uh
 
06:08:38.468 --> 06:08:38.478 align:start position:0%
You' have to give that individual
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
permission aggregated data you know
 
06:08:43.390 --> 06:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's different standards for that for
 
06:08:46.750 --> 06:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
a building owner uh that what I just
 
06:08:49.468 --> 06:08:49.478 align:start position:0%
described could pull the aggregated data
 
06:08:51.990 --> 06:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
without individual customer permission
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
for other uses it's a a minimum of a
 
06:08:57.590 --> 06:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
hundred customers you know if somebody
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
wanted aggregated data on a community
 
06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
for instance they could get the
 
06:09:06.430 --> 06:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
community's total data um but not not um
 
06:09:08.990 --> 06:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
individual customer data so there's a ex
 
06:09:11.990 --> 06:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the exception of a building owner
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's aund a minimum of a
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
hundred different uh uh uh customers uh
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
in order to get aggregated
 
06:09:23.310 --> 06:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
data okay thanks so a follow-up question
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be in order to derive the benefits
 
06:09:32.030 --> 06:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
aggregation would that require
 
06:09:40.628 --> 06:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:40.638 --> 06:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
customers

06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure well for example we've
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of talk here about time of
 
06:09:53.948 --> 06:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
use rates oh right and uh other thing
 
06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
other benefits that could derive from
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
knowing more about customer data so I'm
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
just I'm just wondering if in order to
 
06:10:05.910 --> 06:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
get people to use and to change their
 
06:10:08.990 --> 06:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
their habits about when they use energy
 
06:10:11.468 --> 06:10:11.478 align:start position:0%
does that going to require them to make
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
modifications in their Lifestyles and is
 
06:10:17.670 --> 06:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
that a realistic hope or expectation um
 
06:10:20.270 --> 06:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I think in in in this day and age
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's an increasing amount of customer
 
06:10:26.510 --> 06:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
loads that are flexible uh that don't
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily require behavioral changes
 
06:10:31.708 --> 06:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
that that could be automated for
 
06:10:34.110 --> 06:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
instance if you've got a hot water
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
heater or heat pump hot water heater
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
when that actually gets charged up um
 
06:10:41.628 --> 06:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
you Pro as long as you got hot water you
 
06:10:42.990 --> 06:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't care that's not a behavioral
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
change but whether it gets charged up uh
 
06:10:48.030 --> 06:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
during lowc cost hour versus high cost
 
06:10:50.548 --> 06:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
hours is is a different question and and
 
06:10:52.230 --> 06:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
certainly this whole data platform
 
06:10:54.910 --> 06:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
becomes a lot more useful with interval
 
06:10:57.628 --> 06:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
data um but they're already across all
 
06:10:58.990 --> 06:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities there's a certain amount
 
06:11:01.110 --> 06:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
of interval data for large customers
 
06:11:05.948 --> 06:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
that's actually hard to access or stream
 
06:11:09.310 --> 06:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of this API of apis
 
06:11:11.070 --> 06:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
where you can potentially stream the
 
06:11:13.750 --> 06:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
data uh to somebody who's monitoring it
 
06:11:15.670 --> 06:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
and a huge case in point is the state of
 
06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which has thousands
 
06:11:20.670 --> 06:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds of accounts across these uh
 
06:11:23.708 --> 06:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
five different utilities and and in
 
06:11:26.190 --> 06:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
order to track all that
 
06:11:28.910 --> 06:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
data from from what I understood when
 
06:11:30.628 --> 06:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
when we had a representative of the
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
state on the governance Council much
 
06:11:34.830 --> 06:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
like the city of Lebanon does we have to
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually manually look at each bill and
 
06:11:39.948 --> 06:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
enter the usage for each month into a
 
06:11:43.230 --> 06:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
database to get the total City's energy
 
06:11:46.390 --> 06:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
usage um and that has is is a
 
06:11:48.430 --> 06:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
significant burden in cost and from what
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
I recall about the state's
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative saying is State doesn't
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
even really try to do that because
 
06:11:55.708 --> 06:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
there's so many accounts it it would
 
06:11:57.670 --> 06:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
take several people full-time just to be
 
06:12:00.150 --> 06:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
entering all the individual data and
 
06:12:01.788 --> 06:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
this data platform would solve that
 
06:12:03.708 --> 06:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
problem you'd be able to say State of
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I want all the data
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
bundled together and I want it every
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
month through this data platform uh for
 
06:12:14.270 --> 06:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
each facility for each utility territory
 
06:12:15.868 --> 06:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
and it would just it would just come to
 
06:12:18.750 --> 06:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
you that way um and then you could look
 
06:12:20.190 --> 06:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
at whether you're making progress on
 
06:12:21.468 --> 06:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
your energy
 
06:12:24.750 --> 06:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
goals representative McGee thank you Mr
 
06:12:26.230 --> 06:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
chairman see now you're digging into the
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
fun stuff um so the other thing I'd like
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
to you to maybe illuminate or discuss is
 
06:12:36.628 --> 06:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
whether the tool can assist with things
 
06:12:40.430 --> 06:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
that the state is trying to accomplish
 
06:12:43.270 --> 06:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of our docket objectives around
 
06:12:43.280 --> 06:12:44.270 align:start position:0%
in terms of our docket objectives around
grib

06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
grib
 
06:12:47.708 --> 06:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
modernization um and uh net metering
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
tariffs you know I was trying to explain
 
06:12:51.830 --> 06:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
this morning in the bill that I
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
testified in that being able to turn the
 
06:12:58.468 --> 06:12:58.478 align:start position:0%
data into information allows us to
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
manage and plan and so could you speak a
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
little bit about that because I think we
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
should understand that as well
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
um well I I thought it was interesting I
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
think in one of the fiscal notes doe
 
06:13:12.750 --> 06:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
said they couldn't provide an accurate
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
estimate because they didn't have access
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the data on state energy use um so so
 
06:13:19.910 --> 06:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that I thought well that's that's
 
06:13:22.468 --> 06:13:22.478 align:start position:0%
that's a case for having the uh the
 
06:13:22.478 --> 06:13:24.670 align:start position:0%
that's a case for having the uh the
platform

06:13:24.670 --> 06:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
platform
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
um we we we have heard in part of the
 
06:13:30.628 --> 06:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
market survey that dunsky did found that
 
06:13:32.948 --> 06:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of businesses in the
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
state that have multiple establishments
 
06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you think about any kind of chain
 
06:13:41.430 --> 06:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
retailer or whatever um and they they
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much all interested in managing
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
their energy or Contracting it out um
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's a fair amount of effort to compile
 
06:13:50.990 --> 06:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
that and to compare and and part of the
 
06:13:53.548 --> 06:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
value of the platform was having highly
 
06:13:56.310 --> 06:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
consistent data so that if you a
 
06:13:58.430 --> 06:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
particular data field you knew would
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
know means the same thing regardless of
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
which utility it's coming from um so I
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
think just just broadly speaking it it
 
06:14:08.270 --> 06:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
it it becomes a very useful planning
 
06:14:10.390 --> 06:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
tool and the notion that you know you
 
06:14:13.468 --> 06:14:13.478 align:start position:0%
can't manage what you don't measure um
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
comes into play here which is energ
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
energy is a big part of our cost of
 
06:14:22.590 --> 06:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
living these days and um there are ways
 
06:14:24.750 --> 06:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
to manage it that can produce savings
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
for everyone and you know I'm haven't
 
06:14:29.070 --> 06:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
gotten into that because that's sort of
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
another story but
 
06:14:35.150 --> 06:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh but but but there are things emerging
 
06:14:37.510 --> 06:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
Gene that this platform could help
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
enable and capture for
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
instance FK has ruled and ISO New
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
England has filed conforming tariffs to
 
06:14:49.510 --> 06:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
enable small distributed energy
 
06:14:52.390 --> 06:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
resources to participate in the iso New
 
06:14:56.150 --> 06:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
England market and to do that FK and ISO
 
06:14:58.270 --> 06:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
New England is requiring utilities
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
whether they like it or not if they're
 
06:15:01.830 --> 06:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
big enough and in New Hampshire's case
 
06:15:04.350 --> 06:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's only eversource to have to provide
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
interval metering for those customers
 
06:15:08.910 --> 06:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
even if it's on top of the metering they
 
06:15:12.030 --> 06:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
already have and that additional
 
06:15:15.628 --> 06:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
metering which will be highly granular
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
they've said it's got to be five minutes
 
06:15:18.670 --> 06:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
got to be capable of five minutes
 
06:15:21.510 --> 06:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
because that's how we uh balance uh
 
06:15:24.750 --> 06:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
generation at 5 Minute intervals prices
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
these distributed energy resources that
 
06:15:29.270 --> 06:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
can be aggregated to participate have to
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
have 5minute interval metering that data
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
could come through the platform and and
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
the customer could look towards other
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
inov Innovative service providers to to
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
help them you know optimize and manage
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
the point of all this is if customers to
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
the extent they have a flexible load are
 
06:15:51.190 --> 06:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
start to be able to respond to the
 
06:15:54.110 --> 06:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
prices that generators make you're going
 
06:15:56.110 --> 06:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
to have better price formation supply
 
06:15:58.510 --> 06:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
and demand responding to similar prices
 
06:16:00.670 --> 06:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
and we have an opportunity to shift load
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
off of peak into the valleys and spread
 
06:16:05.788 --> 06:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
all those fixed cost cost for capacity
 
06:16:08.190 --> 06:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
over more kilowatt hours rather than
 
06:16:11.030 --> 06:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
than fewer if we kep keep getting peier
 
06:16:13.830 --> 06:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
which has been the trend in New
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
England yeah which drives the cost down
 
06:16:19.070 --> 06:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
for everyone okay representative Corman
 
06:16:21.070 --> 06:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman
 
06:16:24.830 --> 06:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Belo good to see you yep um
 
06:16:27.590 --> 06:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
so earlier this morning I asked a
 
06:16:31.230 --> 06:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
question on the uh timing of the RFP and
 
06:16:33.750 --> 06:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't get a really concrete answer
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
but you said that you think that we'd
 
06:16:37.670 --> 06:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
actually have bids by the end of the
 
06:16:41.230 --> 06:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
summer yes so um where where does that
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
come from um that comes from the fact
 
06:16:47.628 --> 06:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
that the uh everybody as of last week
 
06:16:49.830 --> 06:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
everybody essentially but doe had signed
 
06:16:52.628 --> 06:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
off on the RFP text and I believe they
 
06:16:54.110 --> 06:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
were going to try to work through any
 
06:16:56.708 --> 06:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
questions they had u in the past few
 
06:17:00.350 --> 06:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
days um so we're we're expecting to file
 
06:17:02.270 --> 06:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
it we have a deadline of this Friday to
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
file a status update the hope is that we
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
are filing the actual proposed RFP uh
 
06:17:09.310 --> 06:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
that then needs the commission's
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
approval for us to go ahead and issue it
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
um and I think we have a a timetable I
 
06:17:15.990 --> 06:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me but uh
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're hoping they're able to turn that
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
around relatively quickly um because
 
06:17:22.670 --> 06:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's you know the document has had a lot
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
of work go to it it's a consensus
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
document um and um if that's the case
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
the RFP will get issued by the utilities
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
not not the state it's important to
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
realize this is
 
06:17:37.708 --> 06:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh would be owned by the utilities which
 
06:17:40.270 --> 06:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
are private Enterprises not not by the
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
state um uh the state would not be the
 
06:17:45.310 --> 06:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
one doe would not be the one Contracting
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
for this it would be the utilities um
 
06:17:52.110 --> 06:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
and the time frame that is uh would
 
06:17:55.590 --> 06:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
allow us to get uh responses back uh uh
 
06:17:57.190 --> 06:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
by the end of the summer before the end
 
06:18:00.190 --> 06:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
of the summer follow up so you said that
 
06:18:02.390 --> 06:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities would issue the RFP would
 
06:18:05.190 --> 06:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
that be one RFP issued by the joint
 
06:18:07.868 --> 06:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
utilities or separate rfps one one
 
06:18:12.070 --> 06:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
Unitil has um volunteered to to be the
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
um sort of sponsoring agent in different
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
things eversource has been the
 
06:18:19.830 --> 06:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
sponsoring agent it's it's it's been
 
06:18:22.190 --> 06:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed by all three utilities
 
06:18:24.468 --> 06:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
procurement departments to make sure
 
06:18:26.430 --> 06:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
complies and and they you know
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
there there's really no cost for us to
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
get the responses back um uh nothing has
 
06:18:35.030 --> 06:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be expended there would be some
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Review Time involved at the end but my
 
06:18:41.230 --> 06:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
guess would be if this bill's retained
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
um certainly before any Contracting
 
06:18:46.990 --> 06:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
occurred uh the expectation I'm I would
 
06:18:48.990 --> 06:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
expect would be to report to the
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee that this back to this
 
06:18:53.390 --> 06:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh uh to get some indication
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
on whether there's support to move it
 
06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
ahead or
 
06:19:00.310 --> 06:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
not representative Wendy
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:19:07.310 --> 06:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
chair sorry um earlier you mentioned
 
06:19:09.390 --> 06:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
that this platform looks at deemed
 
06:19:12.350 --> 06:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
savings no no just that Energy
 
06:19:14.948 --> 06:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs the New Hampshire
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
saves programs mostly rely on what's
 
06:19:20.990 --> 06:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
called deem savings it's like okay if we
 
06:19:23.350 --> 06:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
replace this fluorescent lamp with the
 
06:19:26.190 --> 06:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
LED lamp that should save this much
 
06:19:26.200 --> 06:19:29.468 align:start position:0%
LED lamp that should save this much
energy

06:19:29.468 --> 06:19:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um followup I guess yeah followup um
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
does that include modeled and measured
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
savings as well okay okay thank you well
 
06:19:41.548 --> 06:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
and there there is some effort to verify
 
06:19:44.590 --> 06:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
even deem savings it's called em andv
 
06:19:47.830 --> 06:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
valuation measurement verification um
 
06:19:50.310 --> 06:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there's a trend and
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
it's been implemented in in California
 
06:19:55.190 --> 06:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
for instance uh and and we have an
 
06:19:56.670 --> 06:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
arrangement where we could use one of
 
06:20:00.430 --> 06:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
these Flex Flex Market uh platforms uh
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
that would have contractors assuming
 
06:20:05.830 --> 06:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to actually uh produce
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
the performance um such that their
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
incentive is stronger if their set of
 
06:20:14.468 --> 06:20:14.478 align:start position:0%
measures actually performs uh as as
 
06:20:15.990 --> 06:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
promised thank
 
06:20:18.910 --> 06:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Swanson has a
 
06:20:21.548 --> 06:20:21.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
06:20:25.708 --> 06:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
Mr Belo uh you mentioned supporting this
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill just to be clear uh Bill discussed
 
06:20:34.070 --> 06:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
this morning had to do with uh uh the
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
establishment of a Statewide online
 
06:20:38.350 --> 06:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
energy data platform the one being
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
discussed right now is House Bill
 
06:20:47.390 --> 06:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
723 which discusses uh uh basically
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
getting repealing the you multi-use data
 
06:20:53.548 --> 06:20:53.558 align:start position:0%
enry platform uh do I understand that
 
06:20:55.390 --> 06:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
you are in favor of the bill that was
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning regarding that
 
06:21:01.590 --> 06:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
data platform and oppose the bill House
 
06:21:01.600 --> 06:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
data platform and oppose the bill House
Bill

06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:21:05.110 --> 06:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
723 correct that's correct
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kaplan thank
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Belo for
 
06:21:11.830 --> 06:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
coming in I think we have a good picture
 
06:21:13.230 --> 06:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
of all the work that's gone into the
 
06:21:15.190 --> 06:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
data Hub platform up to this point to
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
get us to this point and you you paint a
 
06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
very Vivid picture of all the
 
06:21:21.708 --> 06:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist if we choose to
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
not kill this data platform um I'm
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
wondering what I seem to be missing
 
06:21:28.670 --> 06:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
maybe other people in this room also
 
06:21:31.868 --> 06:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
shared that lack is is a sense of what
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be what would we kill like what
 
06:21:36.510 --> 06:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
what are the m opportunities if we pass
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
this bill can you paint a picture of
 
06:21:38.320 --> 06:21:41.350 align:start position:0%
this bill can you paint a picture of
that

06:21:41.350 --> 06:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:44.468 --> 06:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
um well I think obviously the RFP would
 
06:21:48.990 --> 06:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
never go out um um I mean I think the Pu
 
06:21:50.548 --> 06:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
would just put the whole thing on hold
 
06:21:54.670 --> 06:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
until they saw what the Senate did um so
 
06:21:58.830 --> 06:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
we and I guess it question is does it
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
become law or not
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
um uh so I think th this this effort
 
06:22:09.270 --> 06:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
obviously would go by the wayside you
 
06:22:13.110 --> 06:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
know I I have a high degree confidence
 
06:22:15.590 --> 06:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
that Unitil will move ahead uh I think
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's next year that they're planning to
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
start their next Generation Um
 
06:22:24.510 --> 06:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art Ami deployment and uh
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
from what I understand that their intent
 
06:22:30.270 --> 06:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
is to provide green button connect my
 
06:22:33.310 --> 06:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
data a functionality uh uh not just
 
06:22:35.230 --> 06:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
download my data but able to share it
 
06:22:38.990 --> 06:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
with other parties um uh but so but I
 
06:22:41.190 --> 06:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't think the other two utilities are
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
are particularly uh moving ahead with
 
06:22:48.270 --> 06:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
that um at this time um so I think I
 
06:22:51.590 --> 06:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
think what we would miss is sort of
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
knowing what it cost to do this Hub and
 
06:22:58.468 --> 06:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
um what we would s we would never really
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
have a handle on whether the
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh the benefits were commensurate with
 
06:23:06.030 --> 06:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
the cost or out you know clearly
 
06:23:07.750 --> 06:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
outweighed the cost or whether it was
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
dubious and I think the committee if you
 
06:23:12.310 --> 06:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
hold on to the bill could make a
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
decision whether they think that the
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
cost benefit is strong enough to allow
 
06:23:18.548 --> 06:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
this to move forward or whether they're
 
06:23:20.670 --> 06:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
dubious of it and don't think the
 
06:23:23.070 --> 06:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis really supports the
 
06:23:26.430 --> 06:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
cost and deems decides to pull the plug
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
on the policy um I just think it would
 
06:23:30.670 --> 06:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
be a better decision with the
 
06:23:32.910 --> 06:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
information thank you very much seeing
 
06:23:34.750 --> 06:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
no more questions I want to bring bring
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
on the last uh person who wants to
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill and that's Sam
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
Evans do have a
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
question well we have 1 hour 45 minutes
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
to discuss two other bills this
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I'd like to move on if you
 
06:23:50.638 --> 06:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I'd like to move on if you
don't

06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:23:55.350 --> 06:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
mind is this really crucial to our
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill we've been
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
talking about it today now for almost
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
three hours I believe it is all right go
 
06:24:04.110 --> 06:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
ahead please be quick this this is
 
06:24:06.110 --> 06:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
something that I know that that Mr Belo
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
can answer that others could not which
 
06:24:11.270 --> 06:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
is how would the costing for this
 
06:24:14.430 --> 06:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
project um be done because I know I had
 
06:24:16.270 --> 06:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
asked you I was trying to do some back
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the envelope
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
calculations um if we could understand
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
how many customers it would be across
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
because I know it's Gas and Electric and
 
06:24:30.150 --> 06:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
also um what what uh how many years of
 
06:24:32.548 --> 06:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
amortization generally would a project
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
like this be spread over for those
 
06:24:38.948 --> 06:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
customers um if if we were to go forward
 
06:24:41.190 --> 06:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
with it because that that makes the math
 
06:24:42.990 --> 06:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
work right and if we can't so we can't
 
06:24:43.000 --> 06:24:43.910 align:start position:0%
work right and if we can't so we can't
figure

06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
figure
 
06:24:46.590 --> 06:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
out what it would cost people on their
 
06:24:49.590 --> 06:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
06:24:53.230 --> 06:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this type of
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
software would be typically advertised
 
06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
over five years um and I don't have
 
06:25:03.390 --> 06:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
those customer counts in front of me uh
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
but in general Ro the formula is to
 
06:25:08.350 --> 06:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
share it across the five utilities based
 
06:25:10.190 --> 06:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
on customer
 
06:25:14.310 --> 06:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
counts thank you okay now we can move on
 
06:25:16.468 --> 06:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
to Sam Evans Brown to get his
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation and he
 
06:25:22.270 --> 06:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
has the last word on this
 
06:25:25.510 --> 06:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill welcome back Sam thank you uh for
 
06:25:26.910 --> 06:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
the record Sam Evans Brown executive
 
06:25:28.708 --> 06:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
director of clean energy New Hampshire
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we also have a member member uh
 
06:25:33.390 --> 06:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
position on the governance Council
 
06:25:36.150 --> 06:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
although we hire a data expert to fill
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
that role so uh I don't uh I while I
 
06:25:39.750 --> 06:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
attend the meetings I'm not a voting
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
member and I'm not the real expert and
 
06:25:43.628 --> 06:25:43.638 align:start position:0%
if you wanted him I could get him here
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
so uh real granular questions about uh
 
06:25:49.390 --> 06:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
the API of API should be retained for
 
06:25:52.628 --> 06:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
him but going last means that I have not
 
06:25:54.990 --> 06:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
a ton to say that that hasn't been said
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
already but I'll just hit on a few
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
things uh first is the question of the
 
06:26:02.270 --> 06:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis the draft cost
 
06:26:03.990 --> 06:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis was submitted to the
 
06:26:06.390 --> 06:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
new Hampshire pu it is available online
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
I have a citation in the footnote of my
 
06:26:09.670 --> 06:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll hand out if
 
06:26:11.948 --> 06:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
folks want to read that over it does in
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
fact find that there's there were be
 
06:26:16.948 --> 06:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
between 21 uh you know at the midc case
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
$21 million in benefits over the first
 
06:26:21.230 --> 06:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
five years of the after the creation of
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
the of the data platform um and
 
06:26:26.270 --> 06:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
potentially 65 million over the first 10
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
years after the creational platform
 
06:26:30.350 --> 06:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
we've hit on uh really where those
 
06:26:32.230 --> 06:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
benefits would come from and it really
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
is allowing these uh competitive third
 
06:26:38.270 --> 06:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
Market service providers to offer more
 
06:26:40.030 --> 06:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire residents in
 
06:26:42.190 --> 06:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
order to reduce their energy spending um
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
and actually think representative brz's
 
06:26:45.590 --> 06:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
story about being on the New Hampshire
 
06:26:47.468 --> 06:26:47.478 align:start position:0%
Electric coops service is a perfect
 
06:26:48.670 --> 06:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
example because the New Hampshire
 
06:26:50.670 --> 06:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
Electric cop does have time of use rates
 
06:26:52.030 --> 06:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
all of the New Hampshire utilities have
 
06:26:53.788 --> 06:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
time of use rates but customers are
 
06:26:55.868 --> 06:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
often unaware of this because the
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
utilities aren't necessarily
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
aggressively marketing those rates and
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
so customers don't know that they exist
 
06:27:01.868 --> 06:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
don't know that they could save money by
 
06:27:05.230 --> 06:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
using them and so creating a a platform
 
06:27:06.868 --> 06:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
that would allow third-party service
 
06:27:09.390 --> 06:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
providers to get connected to that data
 
06:27:11.990 --> 06:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
would create a market for those third
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
party service providers to come in
 
06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
Market the fact that they can save you
 
06:27:17.788 --> 06:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
money if only you were to connect them
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
with their with your data so that they
 
06:27:21.150 --> 06:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
could run an analysis showing when you
 
06:27:23.350 --> 06:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
could uh you know when you could shift
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
those those uh those uses to those
 
06:27:27.590 --> 06:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
flexible uses to the low low Peak
 
06:27:29.910 --> 06:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
periods you know just looking at the the
 
06:27:32.468 --> 06:27:32.478 align:start position:0%
co-ops uh rate it's 11 cents per
 
06:27:35.310 --> 06:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour off peak 21 cents on Peak
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
um so anything that you can shift to
 
06:27:39.070 --> 06:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
that 11 Cent period um is obviously
 
06:27:41.110 --> 06:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of savings to you as a
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
as a as a you know electricity user and
 
06:27:45.310 --> 06:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
I would just say that this generally is
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
in line with the state's stated position
 
06:27:50.590 --> 06:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
to use market-based mechanisms to try to
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
produce savings for customers um but you
 
06:27:55.310 --> 06:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
can't have a functioning Market without
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
access to good data um which is
 
06:27:58.948 --> 06:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
generally the problem that we find in
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
the in the utility space which is that
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
data is hard to find um customers don't
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
really understand their bill uh and
 
06:28:07.350 --> 06:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand the bill drivers um and
 
06:28:08.990 --> 06:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just flag from the grid
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
modernization docket that made the
 
06:28:12.628 --> 06:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation to create to create this
 
06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
platform that it said you know sharing
 
06:28:17.788 --> 06:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
data with the market in order to harness
 
06:28:20.190 --> 06:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
competition and drive ADV Drive Advanced
 
06:28:22.110 --> 06:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
Energy technology deployment I think
 
06:28:23.150 --> 06:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're talking about
 
06:28:25.150 --> 06:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
here is how we harness Market forces
 
06:28:27.150 --> 06:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
that don't have to come from you know
 
06:28:29.390 --> 06:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
utility programs that that uh ultimately
 
06:28:30.788 --> 06:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
have to be paid for by by the rate
 
06:28:33.270 --> 06:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
payers so uh that's really all I have to
 
06:28:34.990 --> 06:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
say happy to take
 
06:28:35.000 --> 06:28:36.708 align:start position:0%
say happy to take
questions

06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee thank you
 
06:28:42.230 --> 06:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh thank you Mr Evans Brown
 
06:28:44.910 --> 06:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
for being with us again so when you
 
06:28:46.830 --> 06:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
started talking about Market competition
 
06:28:49.150 --> 06:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
it made me think about um other states
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
that have already deployed this do you
 
06:28:52.990 --> 06:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
have any information you can share with
 
06:28:55.708 --> 06:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
us about any other states and their
 
06:28:58.230 --> 06:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
markets and how having access to their
 
06:28:59.830 --> 06:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
data has worked out because I know we're
 
06:29:01.948 --> 06:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
not alone right we're not the first yeah
 
06:29:03.670 --> 06:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
so so actually Texas was the first state
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
to Implement a Statewide utility data
 
06:29:08.548 --> 06:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
platform Texas is uh renowned for having
 
06:29:10.910 --> 06:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
the sort of freest energy markets um and
 
06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
have gone the farthest in terms of
 
06:29:15.390 --> 06:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
energy deregulation but but again uh
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
without access to data it's hard for
 
06:29:19.990 --> 06:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
markets to operate and so I think that's
 
06:29:21.910 --> 06:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
why data access was a fundamental
 
06:29:24.430 --> 06:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
principle that um that led to that
 
06:29:26.948 --> 06:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
adoption New York is the next that was
 
06:29:29.750 --> 06:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is taking that step um and and this
 
06:29:31.590 --> 06:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
all came from our attempt to get
 
06:29:33.390 --> 06:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
together the the grip application the
 
06:29:35.150 --> 06:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
grid resilience and Innovation
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
Partnerships application and I'll just
 
06:29:38.750 --> 06:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
note you know the the document again
 
06:29:40.510 --> 06:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
which is available online that was the
 
06:29:42.310 --> 06:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
response to the group application there
 
06:29:44.110 --> 06:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
it says quite a lot of things uh there's
 
06:29:45.548 --> 06:29:45.558 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and strengths in the
 
06:29:47.548 --> 06:29:47.558 align:start position:0%
application uh if you read just the
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
strengths it sounds really great if you
 
06:29:50.990 --> 06:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
read just the weaknesses uh sounds less
 
06:29:53.948 --> 06:29:53.958 align:start position:0%
great um but but the the the fact that
 
06:29:56.430 --> 06:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
this was going to be a New England wide
 
06:29:59.310 --> 06:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh sort of API that that we were
 
06:30:01.948 --> 06:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
pushing for the whole region to adopt
 
06:30:04.310 --> 06:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
was uh was seen as the greatest strength
 
06:30:06.110 --> 06:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
because then service providers would
 
06:30:08.030 --> 06:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a single platform and they would be
 
06:30:10.070 --> 06:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
able to work across all of the New
 
06:30:12.390 --> 06:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
England states and would have an ease of
 
06:30:13.830 --> 06:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
ease of use that would that would make
 
06:30:15.310 --> 06:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
their life easier would would lower
 
06:30:16.670 --> 06:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
marketing costs would lower their
 
06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
operational costs and allow them to
 
06:30:19.548 --> 06:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
offer their services to to rate payers
 
06:30:22.030 --> 06:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
at lower cost I don't know if I answered
 
06:30:23.310 --> 06:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
your question
 
06:30:26.708 --> 06:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
there representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
06:30:29.230 --> 06:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I don't know if you're
 
06:30:30.350 --> 06:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
going to know the answer to this
 
06:30:31.990 --> 06:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
question but you're the last speaker so
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
you get it um
 
06:30:36.868 --> 06:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
do you know if ISO New England has any
 
06:30:38.990 --> 06:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a position on data platforms
 
06:30:41.590 --> 06:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
like this I I do not believe they do but
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
um but that speculation I I I think
 
06:30:45.628 --> 06:30:45.638 align:start position:0%
generally speaking ISO New England uh
 
06:30:47.708 --> 06:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
really refrains from getting involved in
 
06:30:49.030 --> 06:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
state jurisdictional questions and
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
anything on the distribution grid is
 
06:30:52.350 --> 06:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
really state state jurisdictional thank
 
06:30:56.590 --> 06:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much we'll wrap
 
06:31:00.190 --> 06:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
up the uh public hearing on Senate Bill
 
06:31:04.468 --> 06:31:04.478 align:start position:0%
723 with that and representative Vice
 
06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas will open a public hearing
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
on repres on House Bill 7
 
06:31:46.388 --> 06:31:46.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:37.070 --> 06:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay I open a public hearing for H B 672
 
06:32:40.548 --> 06:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
FN and it is to allow for the off-grid
 
06:32:43.670 --> 06:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
electricity providers in New Hampshire
 
06:32:46.230 --> 06:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor representative chairman
 
06:32:48.948 --> 06:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
Michael Vose the floor is
 
06:32:52.350 --> 06:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Vice chair Thomas and
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again to members of the
 
06:32:56.590 --> 06:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Michael Vose
 
06:32:59.310 --> 06:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 5 the
 
06:33:02.750 --> 06:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
town of eeping and I'm pleased to offer
 
06:33:06.190 --> 06:33:06.200 align:start position:0%

06:33:14.270 --> 06:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:33:18.190 --> 06:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
bill allows for off-grid electricity
 
06:33:22.468 --> 06:33:22.478 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire but I think a
 
06:33:24.788 --> 06:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
better way to describe it is described
 
06:33:27.628 --> 06:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
in a handout I provided to all of
 
06:33:27.638 --> 06:33:29.948 align:start position:0%
in a handout I provided to all of
you

06:33:29.948 --> 06:33:29.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:33:33.310 --> 06:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
called what I call this uh legislation
 
06:33:34.350 --> 06:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
as being
 
06:33:37.310 --> 06:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
the foundation for customer regulated
 
06:33:40.190 --> 06:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
energy or
 
06:33:43.110 --> 06:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
electricity I apologize for the fact
 
06:33:44.830 --> 06:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the slides in this
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
presentation are a little bit hard to
 
06:33:49.430 --> 06:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
read because it was given to me in color
 
06:33:51.150 --> 06:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a color printer so I
 
06:33:54.070 --> 06:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
printed it in black and white but most
 
06:33:57.070 --> 06:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the most of the U information in the
 
06:34:00.230 --> 06:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
readable when I say this is enabling
 
06:34:02.798 --> 06:34:04.430 align:start position:0%
readable when I say this is enabling
legislation

06:34:04.430 --> 06:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:34:07.590 --> 06:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
basically what this legislation does is
 
06:34:11.510 --> 06:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
it allows someone to build an energy
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
facility energy production facility
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what type of facility it
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
is natural gas nuclear Hydro solar
 
06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what type the facility is
 
06:34:29.310 --> 06:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
the idea is that the facility is
 
06:34:32.430 --> 06:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
islanded and not connected to the
 
06:34:35.948 --> 06:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
grid and then the facility can sell its
 
06:34:41.150 --> 06:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:45.150 --> 06:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
buyer so the classic example of how this
 
06:34:47.388 --> 06:34:47.398 align:start position:0%
might be used
 
06:34:50.910 --> 06:34:50.920 align:start position:0%

06:34:58.990 --> 06:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
that uses lots of
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
electricity someone could build a energy

06:35:06.868 --> 06:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:35:11.788 --> 06:35:11.798 align:start position:0%
nearby and sell all their energy to that
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:18.270 --> 06:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
Center and the details of the contract
 
06:35:19.990 --> 06:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
between the producer of the electricity
 
06:35:22.030 --> 06:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
and the buyer of the electricity would
 
06:35:23.190 --> 06:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
be up to
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
them and there would be no regulation
 
06:35:29.788 --> 06:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
necessary by the state with the possible
 
06:35:34.990 --> 06:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
exception of citing regulation RSA 162 H
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the facility if
 
06:35:39.468 --> 06:35:39.478 align:start position:0%
it was less than 30 megawatt it might
 
06:35:42.830 --> 06:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:46.270 --> 06:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
sighting processing or proceeding if it
 
06:35:50.468 --> 06:35:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:52.590 --> 06:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
would now the first question you're
 
06:35:56.070 --> 06:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to ask is well if this energy
 
06:35:58.670 --> 06:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
production facility is islanded and not
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
connected from the grid to the grid How
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
does the energy get from the producer to
 
06:36:06.190 --> 06:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer and the question the answer
 
06:36:08.590 --> 06:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
to that question is it'll be up to the
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
producer and the customer to decide that
 
06:36:14.628 --> 06:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
question obviously they have to build
 
06:36:16.190 --> 06:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of a connection between the
 
06:36:19.110 --> 06:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
producer and the and the customer a
 
06:36:22.708 --> 06:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
distribution line of their
 
06:36:22.718 --> 06:36:24.468 align:start position:0%
distribution line of their
own

06:36:24.468 --> 06:36:24.478 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that's an innovation problem that
 
06:36:30.350 --> 06:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
somebody else will have to solve but we
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get in the way of that so
 
06:36:35.548 --> 06:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
that's why introducing this legislation
 
06:36:40.030 --> 06:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
to allow the concept of an off-grid
 
06:36:43.868 --> 06:36:43.878 align:start position:0%
electricity provider offgrid electricity
 
06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
provider to
 
06:36:48.990 --> 06:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
that even though there may be
 
06:36:54.350 --> 06:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
significant problems to making this work
 
06:36:56.788 --> 06:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
we can at least give the market the
 
06:37:00.388 --> 06:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
opportunity to solve those problems
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
and let this situation work it could be
 
06:37:04.878 --> 06:37:06.590 align:start position:0%
and let this situation work it could be
extremely

06:37:06.590 --> 06:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:37:09.070 --> 06:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
Innovative it could be really important
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
to certain parts of New Hampshire too if
 
06:37:13.548 --> 06:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
someone was willing to build a data
 
06:37:18.110 --> 06:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
center uh in a section of the state that
 
06:37:21.350 --> 06:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:24.468 --> 06:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
populated it could provide jobs it could
 
06:37:28.670 --> 06:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
could provide uh other benefits economic
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
benefits to that area and an energy
 
06:37:34.190 --> 06:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
provider NE nearby would be necessary to
 
06:37:36.468 --> 06:37:36.478 align:start position:0%
make the whole thing
 
06:37:39.468 --> 06:37:39.478 align:start position:0%
work now I'm sure that utilities will
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that um there are some possible
 
06:37:47.070 --> 06:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
issues here for example if I have an AI
 
06:37:51.788 --> 06:37:51.798 align:start position:0%
D Data Center and I'm connected to a
 
06:37:55.990 --> 06:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
local producer what do I use for
 
06:37:59.548 --> 06:37:59.558 align:start position:0%
backup and if that backup is the grid
 
06:38:01.910 --> 06:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
then there has to be some way to make
 
06:38:05.350 --> 06:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
sure that there is no connection between
 
06:38:09.070 --> 06:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
the off-grid electricity provider and
 
06:38:14.190 --> 06:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
the grid itself even if it's in the um
 
06:38:17.110 --> 06:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
the building of a user of a user of
 
06:38:18.670 --> 06:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
electricity there has to be a way to
 
06:38:22.510 --> 06:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
separate the two so that they never uh
 
06:38:24.868 --> 06:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
contaminate each
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
other as it as it might be considered
 
06:38:33.788 --> 06:38:33.798 align:start position:0%
so this
 
06:38:36.510 --> 06:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is enabling but it doesn't
 
06:38:39.990 --> 06:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
solve all the problems that might arise
 
06:38:42.468 --> 06:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
if someone decided to take advantage of
 
06:38:42.478 --> 06:38:44.030 align:start position:0%
if someone decided to take advantage of
this

06:38:44.030 --> 06:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:38:46.750 --> 06:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity but at the same time those
 
06:38:51.030 --> 06:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
are relatively easy problems to solve
 
06:38:53.190 --> 06:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
and I might even be open to some
 
06:38:57.070 --> 06:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment legislation here to uh make
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
sure that utilities are completely 100%
 
06:39:06.190 --> 06:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
protected um by this islanded off-grid
 
06:39:06.200 --> 06:39:08.030 align:start position:0%
protected um by this islanded off-grid
electricity

06:39:08.030 --> 06:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
06:39:10.510 --> 06:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
provider so with that basic introduction
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
 
06:39:17.548 --> 06:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
um explore this idea more fully with the
 
06:39:20.230 --> 06:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you uh r% of those I
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
have a question to start off with is my
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
understanding then this enabling
 
06:39:29.110 --> 06:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislation would basically allow for
 
06:39:31.948 --> 06:39:31.958 align:start position:0%
things such as a smallscale nuclear
 
06:39:33.830 --> 06:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
reactor to power
 
06:39:35.670 --> 06:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
one AI data
 
06:39:39.110 --> 06:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
facility side by side maybe or it would
 
06:39:42.910 --> 06:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
just all it would allow that correct
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and I'll do my follow on
 
06:39:45.760 --> 06:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and I'll do my follow on
which

06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:39:47.040 --> 06:39:48.990 align:start position:0%
which
is

06:39:48.990 --> 06:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:39:52.350 --> 06:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
so what kind of like what prevents it
 
06:39:55.350 --> 06:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
now from from happening um if we're
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
keeping it uh I'm assuming
 
06:40:01.510 --> 06:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
this what I should be saying is does
 
06:40:03.628 --> 06:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
this mean that there the the five think
 
06:40:05.388 --> 06:40:05.398 align:start position:0%
what limit is still there or does it do
 
06:40:06.388 --> 06:40:06.398 align:start position:0%
away with
 
06:40:10.388 --> 06:40:10.398 align:start position:0%
that it imposes No Limit
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so there what keeps it from
 
06:40:15.388 --> 06:40:15.398 align:start position:0%
happening now then so the only thing
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
that keeps this from happening today is
 
06:40:21.948 --> 06:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
that the expectation of most energy
 
06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
producers is is is that they would
 
06:40:27.070 --> 06:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
connect to the grid and Supply their
 
06:40:28.708 --> 06:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
energy to the
 
06:40:32.070 --> 06:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
grid this idea says no you don't have to
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
do that and if you don't do that you're
 
06:40:37.230 --> 06:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
not subject to
 
06:40:39.670 --> 06:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
regulation government regulation so
 
06:40:42.670 --> 06:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's the the sort of
 
06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
twist on the idea of producing energy
 
06:40:49.468 --> 06:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
that this legislation would
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
enable representative
 
06:40:53.948 --> 06:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you and thank for
 
06:40:56.628 --> 06:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm not sure if
 
06:40:58.510 --> 06:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
you uh know the answer to this but you
 
06:41:00.070 --> 06:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
know there is someone that's planning on
 
06:41:01.708 --> 06:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
doing this with the data center now and
 
06:41:04.708 --> 06:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's the restarting of 3M Island plant
 
06:41:08.230 --> 06:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
the nuclear plant and I believe they
 
06:41:09.510 --> 06:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
were going to be using regular
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
transmission to to get the the um
 
06:41:14.948 --> 06:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
electricity from the output of the plant
 
06:41:17.628 --> 06:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
to the data center and FK blocked the
 
06:41:20.388 --> 06:41:20.398 align:start position:0%
original proposal so I'm I'm what I'm
 
06:41:22.750 --> 06:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
reading in your bill is that that's not
 
06:41:24.670 --> 06:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about here it would
 
06:41:27.270 --> 06:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
be a completely autonomous system where
 
06:41:29.110 --> 06:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
the power goes directly from the
 
06:41:31.948 --> 06:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
generator to the user and there's no
 
06:41:34.270 --> 06:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
interchange or connection into the
 
06:41:35.910 --> 06:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
regional transmission Grid or even the
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
distribution system for that matter is
 
06:41:39.910 --> 06:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct that is the
 
06:41:43.150 --> 06:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
definition of off-grid electricity
 
06:41:44.548 --> 06:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
provider it
 
06:41:47.830 --> 06:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
means an entity person private company
 
06:41:50.948 --> 06:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
etc etc that engages in any combination
 
06:41:52.510 --> 06:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
of generating
 
06:41:54.670 --> 06:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
transmitting Distributing or selling
 
06:41:57.590 --> 06:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
electricity at retail to customers not
 
06:42:00.468 --> 06:42:00.478 align:start position:0%
connected to any existing regulated
 
06:42:05.388 --> 06:42:05.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:05.398 --> 06:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:42:07.750 --> 06:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:42:10.350 --> 06:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you Mr Vice
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
chairman are there any um is the impetus
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
for your legislation uh a request or
 
06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
the um existence of any real world
 
06:42:27.310 --> 06:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
private parties that have expressed
 
06:42:30.350 --> 06:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
interest in this type of thing or a
 
06:42:32.910 --> 06:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
precedent in another state does this
 
06:42:36.030 --> 06:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
happen happening somewhere else that
 
06:42:38.350 --> 06:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
you're seeing New Hampshire could you
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
know follow in the footsteps capitalize
 
06:42:44.190 --> 06:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
or is is it is the impetus to sort of
 
06:42:47.030 --> 06:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
theoretical at this point well that
 
06:42:48.708 --> 06:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for those three questions that
 
06:42:51.190 --> 06:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
was not three questions and the answer
 
06:42:55.948 --> 06:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
to your your your query your combination
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
of questions is this is happening today
 
06:42:59.280 --> 06:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
of questions is this is happening today
in

06:43:00.150 --> 06:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:43:03.388 --> 06:43:03.398 align:start position:0%
Texas um a group of people in Texas
 
06:43:06.150 --> 06:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually conceived of this idea and have
 
06:43:09.150 --> 06:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
been uh pushing it in Texas and have
 
06:43:11.230 --> 06:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
implemented legislation in Texas to
 
06:43:16.310 --> 06:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
enable this um activity it's Texas is
 
06:43:18.110 --> 06:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
obviously a much bigger State than New
 
06:43:19.750 --> 06:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
06:43:22.750 --> 06:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
the requirement for data centers down
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is pretty substantial so it's it's
 
06:43:27.430 --> 06:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
much more meaningful down there than it
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
is up here but when I saw this idea I
 
06:43:33.750 --> 06:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
thought well why can't we do this here
 
06:43:36.350 --> 06:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
here there's no reason why we can't do
 
06:43:39.310 --> 06:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
this here and it could drive some
 
06:43:41.670 --> 06:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
significant new economic activity for
 
06:43:44.948 --> 06:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire so I thought
 
06:43:48.030 --> 06:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
well let's give this a try let's uh
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
enable this type of
 
06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
activity maybe nobody will will do it
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
but then again right here uh just south
 
06:43:59.468 --> 06:43:59.478 align:start position:0%
of Us in Manchester is the advanced
 
06:44:03.430 --> 06:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
regenerative medicine Institute
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
and they are attempting
 
06:44:10.910 --> 06:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
to make manufacture living human tissue
 
06:44:12.910 --> 06:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
which is going to require massive
 
06:44:15.310 --> 06:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
amounts of of
 
06:44:20.430 --> 06:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
computer uh data to figure out how to
 
06:44:22.910 --> 06:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
manufacture living human
 
06:44:25.548 --> 06:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
tissue I don't know what their data
 
06:44:28.310 --> 06:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
center PL Center plans look like right
 
06:44:30.868 --> 06:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
now but I can Envision that they might
 
06:44:33.708 --> 06:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
be building a data significant sized
 
06:44:36.590 --> 06:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
data center at some point and finding a
 
06:44:38.468 --> 06:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
way to power that data center is going
 
06:44:40.670 --> 06:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
to going to be important to them right
 
06:44:43.628 --> 06:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
now I don't know that our utilities
 
06:44:46.750 --> 06:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
could uh Supply the energy that such a a
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
data center might require so having
 
06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation like this in place could
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
give them a
 
06:44:56.270 --> 06:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
solution and the legislation itself
 
06:44:57.910 --> 06:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve all the Innovation
 
06:45:00.830 --> 06:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
problems that would occur if such a
 
06:45:05.230 --> 06:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
project were to get off the ground but
 
06:45:08.310 --> 06:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
the people putting together the project
 
06:45:11.548 --> 06:45:11.558 align:start position:0%
themselves would find innovative ways
 
06:45:14.548 --> 06:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sure to solve the problems to make
 
06:45:16.868 --> 06:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
it work if they were given the
 
06:45:20.948 --> 06:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you represent of
 
06:45:23.628 --> 06:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
Stiller thank you Mr
 
06:45:26.270 --> 06:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you chairman Vose for
 
06:45:30.070 --> 06:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh this legislation
 
06:45:32.270 --> 06:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
would it it's effectively enabling
 
06:45:34.990 --> 06:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so it wouldn't preclude new
 
06:45:37.110 --> 06:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
forms of technology say for super
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
capacitors as an energy
 
06:45:42.070 --> 06:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
transmission mechanism which would
 
06:45:46.230 --> 06:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
require R&amp;D Etc but this is entirely
 
06:45:48.150 --> 06:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
enabling there's not there's nothing
 
06:45:50.310 --> 06:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
that would preclude new technologies
 
06:45:54.270 --> 06:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
coming in to satisfy transmission needs
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
Etc No in fact I would argue the
 
06:45:59.468 --> 06:45:59.478 align:start position:0%
opposite is the case that this enabling
 
06:46:02.270 --> 06:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislation would encourage the
 
06:46:04.910 --> 06:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
development of new technologies to
 
06:46:04.920 --> 06:46:06.708 align:start position:0%
development of new technologies to
enable

06:46:06.708 --> 06:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
enable
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
transmission if you're going to build an
 
06:46:11.628 --> 06:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
an energy production facility here and
 
06:46:13.150 --> 06:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
there's a data center here you got to
 
06:46:15.070 --> 06:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get the energy there
 
06:46:18.750 --> 06:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
and who knows what new ideas might
 
06:46:22.230 --> 06:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
evolve to solve that problem indeed
 
06:46:22.240 --> 06:46:23.388 align:start position:0%
evolve to solve that problem indeed
thank

06:46:23.388 --> 06:46:23.398 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:46:26.990 --> 06:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee thank you Mr
 
06:46:28.590 --> 06:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you Mr chairman for
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I was looking at
 
06:46:33.310 --> 06:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
the handout that you provided us and the
 
06:46:35.430 --> 06:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
contrast between Lepa and
 
06:46:39.190 --> 06:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
CR and this is makes it really clear um
 
06:46:42.788 --> 06:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's on like the second to last page um
 
06:46:45.468 --> 06:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to focus on the no
 
06:46:48.030 --> 06:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers which I'm sure we
 
06:46:49.628 --> 06:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
would all love I'm sure the utilities
 
06:46:52.830 --> 06:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
would love that as well but um my
 
06:46:55.910 --> 06:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
question is how we could allow
 
06:46:58.150 --> 06:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who will basically have no
 
06:46:58.160 --> 06:46:59.430 align:start position:0%
individuals who will basically have no
regulatory

06:46:59.430 --> 06:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
06:47:04.030 --> 06:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
oversight um how we can uh
 
06:47:07.070 --> 06:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate regulations that are designed
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
to provide safety so for example with
 
06:47:14.430 --> 06:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
electricity uh and Distribution Systems
 
06:47:16.190 --> 06:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
they have to abide by certain standards
 
06:47:19.310 --> 06:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
and quality of cable and whatever um and
 
06:47:21.868 --> 06:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
for nuclear I believe those are all
 
06:47:24.910 --> 06:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
under the national nuclear Regulatory
 
06:47:27.788 --> 06:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
Commission um nuclear power isn't
 
06:47:29.430 --> 06:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
something individuals or private
 
06:47:31.628 --> 06:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
companies are going to be deploying
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
without I I think Federal oversight just
 
06:47:36.750 --> 06:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
because again of Public Safety So when
 
06:47:39.230 --> 06:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
you say no regulatory barriers how can
 
06:47:41.910 --> 06:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
we just eliminate those we can say we
 
06:47:43.868 --> 06:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
don't want them but how can we eliminate
 
06:47:45.830 --> 06:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
them if people are going to be operating
 
06:47:48.548 --> 06:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
in a space that has required those
 
06:47:50.310 --> 06:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
safety regulations from everyone else
 
06:47:50.320 --> 06:47:51.750 align:start position:0%
safety regulations from everyone else
who

06:47:51.750 --> 06:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:47:53.708 --> 06:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
participates so
 
06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation would only eliminate
 
06:48:00.750 --> 06:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
state regulatory barriers so for example
 
06:48:05.230 --> 06:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
in the case of nuclear uh the NRC would
 
06:48:05.240 --> 06:48:07.628 align:start position:0%
in the case of nuclear uh the NRC would
still

06:48:07.628 --> 06:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
still
 
06:48:11.750 --> 06:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
have regulations that that you know any
 
06:48:14.510 --> 06:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
provider would have to have to adhere to
 
06:48:16.590 --> 06:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
to build a small nuclear reactor for
 
06:48:20.590 --> 06:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
example they'd have to have uh NRC
 
06:48:23.430 --> 06:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
approval but there would be no state
 
06:48:25.670 --> 06:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers that they would they
 
06:48:29.868 --> 06:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
would face as I said if it was over 30
 
06:48:31.708 --> 06:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
megawatt they might have to go before
 
06:48:33.708 --> 06:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee which
 
06:48:36.708 --> 06:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
would envir you know impose
 
06:48:40.350 --> 06:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
environmental reviews on the facility
 
06:48:44.110 --> 06:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
but no other state regulation like pu
 
06:48:47.150 --> 06:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
regulation would be
 
06:48:50.350 --> 06:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
required followup I think currently the
 
06:48:52.910 --> 06:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't have that clause in it and
 
06:48:55.310 --> 06:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
you said you were amendable to
 
06:48:59.388 --> 06:48:59.398 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh you know listing that except
 
06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
for the site evaluation committee is
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
that in here because I yes yes that's on
 
06:49:06.910 --> 06:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
line 14 okay so it is in here okay thank
 
06:49:06.920 --> 06:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
line 14 okay so it is in here okay thank
you

06:49:08.750 --> 06:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:49:08.760 --> 06:49:11.030 align:start position:0%
you
representative

06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:49:14.708 --> 06:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
Swanson uh thank you Mr Vice chair uh Mr
 
06:49:17.150 --> 06:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh this is kind of exciting
 
06:49:19.868 --> 06:49:19.878 align:start position:0%
because I think I might have been an off
 
06:49:21.628 --> 06:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
thee grid energy provider when I was
 
06:49:25.948 --> 06:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
living in Hudson I had set up a uh and I
 
06:49:27.750 --> 06:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
hope it would didn't violate any
 
06:49:30.230 --> 06:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
regulations because I had a generator in
 
06:49:33.150 --> 06:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
the backyard and I had an is your
 
06:49:35.110 --> 06:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
question forthcoming please it's it's
 
06:49:37.030 --> 06:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
coming just a little bit of background
 
06:49:39.708 --> 06:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
here so if
 
06:49:43.628 --> 06:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
I in here you describe how it's uh would
 
06:49:43.638 --> 06:49:45.070 align:start position:0%
I in here you describe how it's uh would
be

06:49:45.070 --> 06:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
sold and uh I provided it to myself
 
06:49:50.670 --> 06:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
through a switching mechanism so it
 
06:49:53.430 --> 06:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't con connected to the grid unless
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
I threw the switches so that I could you
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
know run
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
my uh well pump or from the generator or
 
06:50:05.788 --> 06:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
or get the electricity from the grid but
 
06:50:09.070 --> 06:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh apart from that I think I met all
 
06:50:11.548 --> 06:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
of the uh stipulations here other than
 
06:50:14.030 --> 06:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
selling it to myself obviously I didn't
 
06:50:16.990 --> 06:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
do it in the language here can a
 
06:50:19.628 --> 06:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
company uh actually pay for its own
 
06:50:22.070 --> 06:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
generation system and doesn't need to
 
06:50:24.150 --> 06:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
worry about complying with any
 
06:50:26.708 --> 06:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
regulations if it just installs it
 
06:50:29.868 --> 06:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
itself as opposed to hiring a commercial
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
provider to come in and provide them as
 
06:50:37.350 --> 06:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
Island if it can isolate itself
 
06:50:39.388 --> 06:50:39.398 align:start position:0%
completely from the grid so that it's
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
completely off grid then no it wouldn't
 
06:50:48.270 --> 06:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
regulation thank you whether you sold it
 
06:50:55.030 --> 06:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:55.040 --> 06:50:57.628 align:start position:0%
 
yourselves

06:50:57.628 --> 06:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
06:51:01.190 --> 06:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas please thank you
 
06:51:01.200 --> 06:51:02.868 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas please thank you
um

06:51:02.868 --> 06:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:04.990 --> 06:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for presenting this bill um
 
06:51:07.468 --> 06:51:07.478 align:start position:0%
let's talk a little bit about logistics
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
would an off-grid provider be required
 
06:51:12.030 --> 06:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
to sign a certificate of deregulation
 
06:51:16.350 --> 06:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
comma be overseen by pu comma and how
 
06:51:18.670 --> 06:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
would any members and I'm putting that
 
06:51:21.270 --> 06:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
in quotations be contacted regarding
 
06:51:21.280 --> 06:51:23.150 align:start position:0%
in quotations be contacted regarding
continued

06:51:23.150 --> 06:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
continued
 
06:51:25.468 --> 06:51:25.478 align:start position:0%
deregulation so the answer to all those
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions is or the first two questions
 
06:51:30.270 --> 06:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
anyway is no and the answer to the third
 
06:51:33.430 --> 06:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
question is it's not applicable
 
06:51:36.910 --> 06:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
followup followup um you also mentioned
 
06:51:40.230 --> 06:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
large data centers um that would be off
 
06:51:43.750 --> 06:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
grid until it needed to go on grid so it
 
06:51:48.750 --> 06:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be hooked up to both um so my my
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
you can qualify that but my question is
 
06:51:52.190 --> 06:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
isn't that having your cake and eating
 
06:51:52.200 --> 06:51:54.510 align:start position:0%
isn't that having your cake and eating
it

06:51:54.510 --> 06:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
too no the the definition of off-grid
 
06:52:01.190 --> 06:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
electricity provider is that you are
 
06:52:04.590 --> 06:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
off- grid period all the time you never
 
06:52:08.590 --> 06:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
go on grid you are always off grid you
 
06:52:11.548 --> 06:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
are islanded from the grid that is the
 
06:52:16.110 --> 06:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:19.388 --> 06:52:19.398 align:start position:0%
please uh youve had your followup let's
 
06:52:21.190 --> 06:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
let's go on to representative Bernard
 
06:52:22.910 --> 06:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
for right
 
06:52:26.270 --> 06:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair uh
 
06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
so in discussion of this you've you've
 
06:52:32.070 --> 06:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
spoken about the provider uh and having
 
06:52:35.388 --> 06:52:35.398 align:start position:0%
a customer like a big data center but it
 
06:52:37.510 --> 06:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation doesn't limit it to
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
that kind of an entity one could have a
 
06:52:45.150 --> 06:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
gated community of 35 very well-healed
 
06:52:46.990 --> 06:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that want to create their
 
06:52:49.948 --> 06:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
own little off-scale ey Island and and
 
06:52:52.628 --> 06:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
do this or or something like that or or
 
06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
a business that wants to ensure
 
06:52:57.670 --> 06:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the supply and rely on it
 
06:53:00.510 --> 06:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
totally on their own is that possible
 
06:53:03.628 --> 06:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely some people have com compared
 
06:53:03.638 --> 06:53:04.670 align:start position:0%
absolutely some people have com compared
this

06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:53:08.430 --> 06:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
islanded um off-grid electricity
 
06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
provider to a
 
06:53:13.230 --> 06:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
microgrid a micro grid could be
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
considered similar except that a
 
06:53:18.948 --> 06:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
microgrid is only temporarily or
 
06:53:22.350 --> 06:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes Off the Grid whereas one of
 
06:53:28.388 --> 06:53:28.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
Grid okay we're beginning to ask similar
 
06:53:33.430 --> 06:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions so I'll ask ask representative
 
06:53:36.150 --> 06:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
Corman if he has a new one thank you I
 
06:53:39.788 --> 06:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
do and thank you chairman Vose you
 
06:53:41.948 --> 06:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
always ask us to ask questions about the
 
06:53:44.948 --> 06:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill this is a question about the bill
 
06:53:49.310 --> 06:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh the bill uh adds a section to RSA 374
 
06:53:52.190 --> 06:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
it adds 374 colon
 
06:53:56.388 --> 06:53:56.398 align:start position:0%
3C and then on lines 12 and 13 it says
 
06:53:58.030 --> 06:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
an offgrid electricity provided that
 
06:53:59.628 --> 06:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
begins operations onor after the
 
06:54:01.548 --> 06:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section shall be
 
06:54:03.468 --> 06:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
exempt from RSA
 
06:54:07.430 --> 06:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
374 so the the bill is
 
06:54:11.190 --> 06:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
exempting something from itself is that
 
06:54:13.270 --> 06:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
right that does sound kind of
 
06:54:16.070 --> 06:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
contradictory doesn't it but essentially
 
06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
what that says is that RSA 374 is the
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
section of law that governs governs
 
06:54:28.190 --> 06:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
utilities and uh govern governs the the
 
06:54:32.548 --> 06:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
delivery of electrical energy and so
 
06:54:34.990 --> 06:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
what this Bill is saying is that if
 
06:54:39.190 --> 06:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're an offgrid electricity provider
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:47.948 --> 06:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
uh the effective date of this
 
06:54:50.350 --> 06:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
legislation then that means that you are
 
06:54:52.548 --> 06:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
no longer subject
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
to the provisions of RSA 374 so you're
 
06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
not subject to a utility regulation
 
06:55:02.548 --> 06:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
that's the whole P purpose of the bill
 
06:55:02.558 --> 06:55:03.468 align:start position:0%
that's the whole P purpose of the bill
is

06:55:03.468 --> 06:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
to to make these off-grid electricity
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:17.788 --> 06:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
regulation represent Kaplan thank you Mr
 
06:55:20.388 --> 06:55:20.398 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you chairman Vose
 
06:55:22.670 --> 06:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh for bringing this bill I I am all in
 
06:55:24.468 --> 06:55:24.478 align:start position:0%
favor of Market innovation in in the
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
energy sector I think it's a a powerful
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
force for good uh however I am a little
 
06:55:31.230 --> 06:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
bit concerned about just total
 
06:55:33.948 --> 06:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
deregulation of these uh of these new
 
06:55:35.468 --> 06:55:35.478 align:start position:0%
micro grids or whatever you want to call
 
06:55:37.750 --> 06:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
them the islanded uh grids so my
 
06:55:41.468 --> 06:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
question is don't you agree you know did
 
06:55:43.548 --> 06:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
do you foresee or maybe maybe you can
 
06:55:45.548 --> 06:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
look at the example of Texas and maybe
 
06:55:46.990 --> 06:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
you can find the answer there but AR
 
06:55:48.948 --> 06:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
aren't there environmental regulations
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
such as air emissions water usage Etc
 
06:55:55.388 --> 06:55:55.398 align:start position:0%
that these facilities ought to be
 
06:55:58.708 --> 06:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
subject to outside of their electricity
 
06:56:01.070 --> 06:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
regulation yes I I agree with that
 
06:56:05.750 --> 06:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill unlock line 14 says
 
06:56:09.510 --> 06:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they are or lines 13 and 14 says
 
06:56:11.350 --> 06:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
that an offgrid electricity provider
 
06:56:13.788 --> 06:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
shall remain subject to all other
 
06:56:15.990 --> 06:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
applicable applicable laws and
 
06:56:19.548 --> 06:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
regulations including RSA 162
 
06:56:24.030 --> 06:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
H so the only regulations they're exempt
 
06:56:26.948 --> 06:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
from are RSA
 
06:56:28.788 --> 06:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
374 thank
 
06:56:31.590 --> 06:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll take question from
 
06:56:33.070 --> 06:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Haring
 
06:56:35.230 --> 06:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
and then from representative
 
06:56:37.388 --> 06:56:37.398 align:start position:0%
PL I'll make it very quick I think what
 
06:56:39.708 --> 06:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
you're saying then is that this bill
 
06:56:42.350 --> 06:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
does takes care of economic regulation
 
06:56:44.788 --> 06:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
of the generator is no longer applicable
 
06:56:46.868 --> 06:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
but all the other things like air
 
06:56:49.388 --> 06:56:49.398 align:start position:0%
permits and water discharge permits and
 
06:56:51.230 --> 06:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
anything that comes out of uh those
 
06:56:54.510 --> 06:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
different departments would still apply
 
06:56:58.190 --> 06:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
exactly represent PL do you wave it off
 
06:57:02.270 --> 06:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:04.430 --> 06:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take your question as being the
 
06:57:07.150 --> 06:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
last one before the good representative
 
06:57:08.910 --> 06:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
is over
 
06:57:11.230 --> 06:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
shellshocked with
 
06:57:13.990 --> 06:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions I I'm I'm afraid chairman Bose
 
06:57:15.990 --> 06:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
is not going to be Shell Shocked by my
 
06:57:18.788 --> 06:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
question and I hope not the my question
 
06:57:21.430 --> 06:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
is whether or not um I understand the
 
06:57:24.510 --> 06:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill um whether or not
 
06:57:28.150 --> 06:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
our micro grid law would already allow
 
06:57:31.510 --> 06:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
for most of this except for the extra
 
06:57:31.520 --> 06:57:33.350 align:start position:0%
for most of this except for the extra
regulatory

06:57:33.350 --> 06:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
06:57:36.990 --> 06:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
piece I don't think so because a micro
 
06:57:40.430 --> 06:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
grid as I said earlier can sometimes be
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
connected to the grid it'll only be
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
disconnected under certain conditions
 
06:57:49.590 --> 06:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
whereas these uh islands are always not
 
06:57:52.310 --> 06:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
connected to the grid by
 
06:57:55.350 --> 06:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
definition it's a dedicated power
 
06:57:55.360 --> 06:57:57.070 align:start position:0%
definition it's a dedicated power
circuit

06:57:57.070 --> 06:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
06:57:59.590 --> 06:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay see no other questions thank
 
06:58:01.310 --> 06:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
you representative for an excellent
 
06:58:04.948 --> 06:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and and answer session uh next
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'll call up Mr David shulock from the
 
06:58:12.150 --> 06:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doe Mr shock welcome
 
06:58:19.388 --> 06:58:19.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:21.788 --> 06:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
yours good afternoon for the record my
 
06:58:23.590 --> 06:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
name is David shulock I'm the general
 
06:58:25.350 --> 06:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
counsel at the New Hampshire Department
 
06:58:28.388 --> 06:58:28.398 align:start position:0%
of energy and uh I'd like to start by
 
06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
saying that we are neutral on this bill
 
06:58:33.430 --> 06:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
but immediately after that I'd like to
 
06:58:35.590 --> 06:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
compliment representative Vose uh for
 
06:58:37.990 --> 06:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
being Innovative and for bringing this
 
06:58:40.830 --> 06:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
bill to you right
 
06:58:43.628 --> 06:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
um we we didn't fully understand the
 
06:58:46.150 --> 06:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill before uh
 
06:58:49.670 --> 06:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative V's uh testified uh so
 
06:58:51.910 --> 06:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just give a a couple brief
 
06:58:54.788 --> 06:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
observations if the intent is to fully
 
06:58:57.868 --> 06:58:57.878 align:start position:0%
deregulate everything related to these
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
um these systems the bill language does
 
06:59:03.150 --> 06:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
not go far enough to do that
 
06:59:04.708 --> 06:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
okay these systems would be Public
 
06:59:07.150 --> 06:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities under RSA
 
06:59:10.910 --> 06:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
362 right and and there are many other
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
statutes besides 374 that regulate
 
06:59:17.750 --> 06:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
public utility actions right so you'd
 
06:59:20.510 --> 06:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
have questions of do they contribute to
 
06:59:23.110 --> 06:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund do they
 
06:59:24.948 --> 06:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
contribute to the
 
06:59:31.030 --> 06:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
SBC right um and probably a myriad other
 
06:59:34.510 --> 06:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh buried within there um I'd
 
06:59:38.110 --> 06:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
also like to observe that uh there is no
 
06:59:41.030 --> 06:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
Geographic limitation to these systems
 
06:59:42.430 --> 06:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
they could stretch from one end of the
 
06:59:44.670 --> 06:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
state to the other taking distribution
 
06:59:46.350 --> 06:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
lines transmission lines through all of
 
06:59:48.548 --> 06:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
our neighborhoods and there is no safety
 
06:59:48.558 --> 06:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
our neighborhoods and there is no safety
regulation

06:59:49.910 --> 06:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
06:59:54.310 --> 06:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever right uh RSA 3741 is the
 
06:59:56.350 --> 06:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
fundamental basis for the dep Department
 
06:59:59.110 --> 06:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
of energies uh safety regulation
 
07:00:02.190 --> 07:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
accident reporting is in that uh section
 
07:00:05.070 --> 07:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
as is the Dig Safe program uh these
 
07:00:07.430 --> 07:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
systems could bury
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
conduit uh pretty much anywhere but
 
07:00:12.110 --> 07:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
never have to mark out where it's buried
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
before people dig now they probably they
 
07:00:16.708 --> 07:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
would probably want to so that people
 
07:00:18.430 --> 07:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
didn't disrupt their services but they
 
07:00:22.948 --> 07:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be required to right so um the
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
other thing that I'd like to note is
 
07:00:25.350 --> 07:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
that I
 
07:00:28.990 --> 07:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
think much of what representative o
 
07:00:32.030 --> 07:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
would like to accomplish with this bill
 
07:00:33.868 --> 07:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
you could probably accomplish under
 
07:00:33.878 --> 07:00:35.150 align:start position:0%
you could probably accomplish under
present

07:00:35.150 --> 07:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
present
 
07:00:39.110 --> 07:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
law uh without too much difficulty um
 
07:00:42.590 --> 07:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so what I would suggest um is that
 
07:00:44.830 --> 07:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative o if you'd
 
07:00:47.310 --> 07:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
like to work with our office of energy
 
07:00:50.750 --> 07:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
Innovation to figure out ways to solve
 
07:00:52.468 --> 07:00:52.478 align:start position:0%
all of those problems we'd be more than
 
07:00:55.948 --> 07:00:55.958 align:start position:0%
happy to do that with you
 
07:00:59.590 --> 07:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know a time frame for when
 
07:01:02.310 --> 07:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to help you uh we have uh
 
07:01:04.948 --> 07:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
two people in that office one has been
 
07:01:09.350 --> 07:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
out uh for on an extended leave and the
 
07:01:11.670 --> 07:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
other position is tied up in the uh
 
07:01:14.230 --> 07:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze but more than happy to
 
07:01:15.868 --> 07:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
work with you on on figuring something
 
07:01:18.868 --> 07:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:22.030 --> 07:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
out Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
07:01:23.468 --> 07:01:23.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:01:27.430 --> 07:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question so by virtue of your
 
07:01:31.510 --> 07:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
testimony do you mean that if a company
 
07:01:33.030 --> 07:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
and we do have a company here in the
 
07:01:35.788 --> 07:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
state that does manufacture equipment
 
07:01:38.150 --> 07:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
for this if someone if somebody wanted
 
07:01:40.708 --> 07:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
to come in tomorrow and say I want to
 
07:01:44.110 --> 07:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
put in a smallscale nuclear reactor in
 
07:01:46.750 --> 07:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
coaz County because uh I'm in
 
07:01:48.548 --> 07:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
partnership with a data center that's
 
07:01:51.590 --> 07:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's being built there they would have
 
07:01:53.628 --> 07:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
no restrictions or obstacles whatsoever
 
07:01:56.548 --> 07:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
to do that provided they follow the
 
07:02:00.830 --> 07:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
exact same uh rsas that are on here now
 
07:02:02.868 --> 07:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a little uncomfortable
 
07:02:06.990 --> 07:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
Fielding hypotheticals given how one
 
07:02:11.310 --> 07:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
small fact might change the scenario uh
 
07:02:13.628 --> 07:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
and but our our office would be more
 
07:02:16.350 --> 07:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
than willing to to work on those
 
07:02:20.468 --> 07:02:20.478 align:start position:0%
scenarios with folks follow up follow up
 
07:02:23.990 --> 07:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
um yes um well the entire bill is
 
07:02:27.548 --> 07:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
hypothetical really uh to allow new
 
07:02:30.750 --> 07:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
innovation so I guess I was just asking
 
07:02:32.788 --> 07:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
because you commented that there was uh
 
07:02:35.030 --> 07:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
that it could be done under under prison
 
07:02:38.230 --> 07:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
law I just wanted to find out if if if
 
07:02:40.150 --> 07:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
if that type of scenario would would
 
07:02:41.830 --> 07:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
come under prison law and and all you'd
 
07:02:43.388 --> 07:02:43.398 align:start position:0%
have to do is make sure they file all
 
07:02:45.110 --> 07:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
all of the usual permits and everything
 
07:02:47.788 --> 07:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
well there are different aspects to it
 
07:02:50.310 --> 07:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
so for instance a a nuclear facility
 
07:02:52.230 --> 07:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
would have to go you you said Nuclear So
 
07:02:54.030 --> 07:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear would have to go through Federal
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
sighting um some State sighting right
 
07:03:02.910 --> 07:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
um but they can be Exempted from public
 
07:03:05.708 --> 07:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
utility regulation a number of ways
 
07:03:08.070 --> 07:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in the statute that
 
07:03:10.350 --> 07:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
says when a generation facility is
 
07:03:12.190 --> 07:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
considered a regulated public utility
 
07:03:17.868 --> 07:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
and when it's not um and then um they
 
07:03:20.150 --> 07:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
could there's there's no reason why they
 
07:03:22.110 --> 07:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't sell all of their output put to
 
07:03:24.230 --> 07:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
a competitive supplier competitive
 
07:03:26.868 --> 07:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
suppliers are lightly regulated and
 
07:03:28.388 --> 07:03:28.398 align:start position:0%
those competitive suppliers could sell
 
07:03:28.398 --> 07:03:29.468 align:start position:0%
those competitive suppliers could sell
to

07:03:29.468 --> 07:03:29.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:03:31.948 --> 07:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
anybody and and even be connected you
 
07:03:35.910 --> 07:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:39.670 --> 07:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
grd additional questions for Mr
 
07:03:41.628 --> 07:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
shoock now I'm sorry certain things
 
07:03:43.670 --> 07:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be regulated though like the
 
07:03:46.190 --> 07:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
interconnection right we we regulate the
 
07:03:50.230 --> 07:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:53.388 --> 07:03:53.398 align:start position:0%
side okay see no further questions thank
 
07:03:56.030 --> 07:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
you very much next up is Donald C from
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I'm still
 
07:04:06.830 --> 07:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
Donald Cree I'm still the consumer
 
07:04:08.350 --> 07:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate we represent the interests of
 
07:04:10.868 --> 07:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers uh much as
 
07:04:13.628 --> 07:04:13.638 align:start position:0%
Mr shulu did I'm really here just to
 
07:04:16.388 --> 07:04:16.398 align:start position:0%
compliment the chairman for his openness
 
07:04:19.350 --> 07:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
to Innovation uh I think the same folks
 
07:04:23.230 --> 07:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
who produced that uh set of slides that
 
07:04:24.990 --> 07:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman distributed were kind
 
07:04:26.430 --> 07:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
enough to talk with me a little bit
 
07:04:28.430 --> 07:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
about the idea that they came up with
 
07:04:30.070 --> 07:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
which is based on what happens down in
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
Texas and I was sufficiently intrigued
 
07:04:35.670 --> 07:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
by what they were proposing to suggest
 
07:04:38.468 --> 07:04:38.478 align:start position:0%
that this bill is uh worth perfecting
 
07:04:43.070 --> 07:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
and possibly even adopting I uh I agree
 
07:04:45.750 --> 07:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
with uh Mr shulock that there are some
 
07:04:47.150 --> 07:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
improvements to the bill that could be
 
07:04:49.948 --> 07:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
made so that it really does achieve what
 
07:04:52.708 --> 07:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
I understand the objectives of the bill
 
07:04:56.110 --> 07:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh we do have we do get I do get a
 
07:04:59.270 --> 07:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
little worried about telling big
 
07:05:01.468 --> 07:05:01.478 align:start position:0%
consumers of electricity that they don't
 
07:05:04.310 --> 07:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to contribute to utility the
 
07:05:06.548 --> 07:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
recovery of utility fixed costs and
 
07:05:09.110 --> 07:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
system benefits charges and other things
 
07:05:11.830 --> 07:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
that all other customers would continue
 
07:05:14.388 --> 07:05:14.398 align:start position:0%
to contribute to but offsetting those
 
07:05:17.190 --> 07:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
concerns is the idea that maybe one of
 
07:05:18.948 --> 07:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
these projects could actually happen in
 
07:05:21.230 --> 07:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh that might have
 
07:05:23.990 --> 07:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefits for the economy and
 
07:05:25.788 --> 07:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
the people of the state so I think it
 
07:05:28.430 --> 07:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
deserves your favorable consideration
 
07:05:30.110 --> 07:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
and uh beyond that I don't have too much
 
07:05:32.990 --> 07:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
to add I just wanted to uh add an a note
 
07:05:34.590 --> 07:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
of ascent to the
 
07:05:37.030 --> 07:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
discourse well thank you I appreciate
 
07:05:39.910 --> 07:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
that questions representative McGee has
 
07:05:43.430 --> 07:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
one or no Wendy Thomas I think yes all I
 
07:05:47.070 --> 07:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
can see is an arm um I know it's the
 
07:05:51.388 --> 07:05:51.398 align:start position:0%
black arm um thank you for being here um
 
07:05:54.430 --> 07:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
so you talked about there might be one
 
07:05:56.468 --> 07:05:56.478 align:start position:0%
case of this happening in New Hampshire
 
07:05:59.548 --> 07:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
you know it it it could happen um what
 
07:06:02.670 --> 07:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
if there are many many these off-grid
 
07:06:05.510 --> 07:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
providers set up what could be the
 
07:06:08.070 --> 07:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
impact to New Hampshire's bottom line
 
07:06:11.590 --> 07:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:13.708 --> 07:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
income uh if there were lots of these
 
07:06:16.110 --> 07:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
projects yeah and they're deregulated I
 
07:06:18.948 --> 07:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
mean does that impact our our budget
 
07:06:21.788 --> 07:06:21.798 align:start position:0%
bottom line or uh does that take money
 
07:06:24.708 --> 07:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
away from the state if if all of these
 
07:06:27.230 --> 07:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
off-grid providers are deregulated like
 
07:06:31.070 --> 07:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure what you mean by your
 
07:06:32.830 --> 07:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
question do you mean it would have
 
07:06:35.670 --> 07:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
adverse consequences for the utility
 
07:06:37.350 --> 07:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
consumers who were still connected to
 
07:06:39.310 --> 07:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
the grid and still taking service from
 
07:06:41.110 --> 07:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
the utilities it
 
07:06:45.750 --> 07:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
could uh but you know to some degree uh
 
07:06:49.468 --> 07:06:49.478 align:start position:0%
this is an acknowledgement that the the
 
07:06:51.628 --> 07:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
the assumption that electricity is
 
07:06:54.468 --> 07:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
always a natural monopoly for all
 
07:06:56.788 --> 07:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
purposes uh we we see that breaking down
 
07:07:00.270 --> 07:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
around the edges and uh you know there
 
07:07:03.150 --> 07:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
is no
 
07:07:06.190 --> 07:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
valid public policy reason why if you
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to use that smallscale nuclear
 
07:07:11.150 --> 07:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
reactor example why you couldn't build
 
07:07:13.868 --> 07:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
such a reactor in an economically
 
07:07:16.190 --> 07:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged part of the State uh
 
07:07:18.430 --> 07:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
attach it to a data center or some other
 
07:07:21.110 --> 07:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise like a medical Innovation
 
07:07:22.910 --> 07:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
facility like the one I heard repres uh
 
07:07:25.150 --> 07:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose mention and you know that
 
07:07:27.230 --> 07:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
generates economic benefits that would
 
07:07:30.070 --> 07:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
create jobs and economic activity for
 
07:07:32.030 --> 07:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
the that would benefit all of us here in
 
07:07:33.788 --> 07:07:33.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I think it's an
 
07:07:37.990 --> 07:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:41.350 --> 07:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you no more questions
 
07:07:44.030 --> 07:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
final word on this bill goes to Michael
 
07:07:51.910 --> 07:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:56.670 --> 07:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
eversource Welcome Back good to see you
 
07:07:58.948 --> 07:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Michael lado representing
 
07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
eversource energy appreciate the comment
 
07:08:04.350 --> 07:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity to come before you
 
07:08:09.230 --> 07:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
today um as the doe noted we we do think
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
that uh many parts of this are allowed
 
07:08:16.230 --> 07:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
under the current statutes however uh we
 
07:08:18.350 --> 07:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
do appreciate that the bill I think
 
07:08:20.788 --> 07:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
tries to add some specificity and and
 
07:08:23.590 --> 07:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
detail around uh this this issue which
 
07:08:26.430 --> 07:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
is I think largely uh folks can make
 
07:08:29.388 --> 07:08:29.398 align:start position:0%
assumptions based upon current statute
 
07:08:31.270 --> 07:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh about what they can and can't do on
 
07:08:35.310 --> 07:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
their their own property um I do think
 
07:08:38.388 --> 07:08:38.398 align:start position:0%
uh it would be helpful to have uh maybe
 
07:08:41.468 --> 07:08:41.478 align:start position:0%
three clarifications in the bill uh and
 
07:08:43.868 --> 07:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
I think various questions have touched
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
on this um the first is uh it would be
 
07:08:49.548 --> 07:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
very helpful from the utility standpoint
 
07:08:53.110 --> 07:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that there uh is no
 
07:08:56.230 --> 07:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh allowed between the
 
07:08:59.430 --> 07:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
utility and um distribution or
 
07:09:03.430 --> 07:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
transmission system uh and this offgrid
 
07:09:06.388 --> 07:09:06.398 align:start position:0%
uh provider whether that's primary or
 
07:09:10.070 --> 07:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
backup uh and the backup is is where you
 
07:09:12.350 --> 07:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
know we're sort of focusing our our
 
07:09:15.628 --> 07:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
attention um we have had instances in
 
07:09:18.590 --> 07:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions where um a large
 
07:09:22.948 --> 07:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
data center looked a site behind a large
 
07:09:25.230 --> 07:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
um generator they said well there's no
 
07:09:26.788 --> 07:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
connection here there's no connection
 
07:09:30.150 --> 07:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
here uh and there was and when pointed
 
07:09:31.430 --> 07:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
out they said well that's just for
 
07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
backup you know we don't really you know
 
07:09:36.670 --> 07:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
intend to use that um when we design the
 
07:09:38.270 --> 07:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
electric uh distribution and
 
07:09:41.070 --> 07:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
transmission system we have to to design
 
07:09:43.548 --> 07:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
it for basically every eventuality and
 
07:09:46.628 --> 07:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
so if the generator uh stop producing
 
07:09:49.548 --> 07:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
and they shifted to backup power if it's
 
07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
not properly designed and interconnected
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
into the the distribution or
 
07:09:54.990 --> 07:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
transmission system it could cause
 
07:09:56.990 --> 07:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
overloading and so just a little
 
07:09:58.868 --> 07:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
clarification there and I believe it's
 
07:10:00.910 --> 07:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
in keeping with what I heard was the
 
07:10:03.948 --> 07:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor intent that this is uh separated
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
from uh from the electric and and
 
07:10:08.430 --> 07:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
transmission system sorry distribution
 
07:10:11.708 --> 07:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
and transmission system um also just
 
07:10:13.788 --> 07:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
picking up on a comment that the
 
07:10:17.350 --> 07:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy made about um and
 
07:10:20.708 --> 07:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
others uh about sort of exempting from
 
07:10:23.548 --> 07:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
being a a public utility exempting from
 
07:10:26.430 --> 07:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
certain safety statutes uh and
 
07:10:29.110 --> 07:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
requirements um I think a a helpful
 
07:10:33.270 --> 07:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
clarification would be uh that the uh
 
07:10:36.388 --> 07:10:36.398 align:start position:0%
off-grid energy provider uh cannot
 
07:10:36.398 --> 07:10:37.750 align:start position:0%
off-grid energy provider uh cannot
construct

07:10:37.750 --> 07:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
construct
 
07:10:41.030 --> 07:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh either in or across
 
07:10:44.110 --> 07:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
any federal state or local
 
07:10:46.708 --> 07:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
roadways um we think that this would be
 
07:10:50.110 --> 07:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
would be a helpful um provision to
 
07:10:54.350 --> 07:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
clarify and avoid any uh safety concerns
 
07:10:57.030 --> 07:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh just two examples that i' I'd give or
 
07:11:00.190 --> 07:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals one is um again we don't
 
07:11:01.750 --> 07:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
know what standard
 
07:11:03.868 --> 07:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
uh that they would this you know
 
07:11:05.510 --> 07:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
non-regulated entity would be
 
07:11:08.830 --> 07:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
constructing to uh what remote control
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they would have over their system
 
07:11:14.310 --> 07:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh if there was some sort of failure um
 
07:11:17.190 --> 07:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
or you know obviously weather events
 
07:11:19.510 --> 07:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
would impact uh this entity just like it
 
07:11:22.548 --> 07:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
does with uh a public utility um we
 
07:11:24.910 --> 07:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
certainly have had situations where we
 
07:11:27.948 --> 07:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
have wire energized wires down on a on a
 
07:11:30.910 --> 07:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle uh with individuals in
 
07:11:32.350 --> 07:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
that vehicle that's just sort of an
 
07:11:34.830 --> 07:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
example of an emergency situation where
 
07:11:36.310 --> 07:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the first responder needs to know
 
07:11:39.310 --> 07:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
exactly who to call in order to um
 
07:11:41.310 --> 07:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
address that situation and de energize
 
07:11:44.948 --> 07:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
those lines so um keeping this uh
 
07:11:47.830 --> 07:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
contained within you know a piece of
 
07:11:49.868 --> 07:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
private property or or multiple pieces
 
07:11:52.628 --> 07:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
of private property that don't cross uh
 
07:11:54.510 --> 07:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
roadways I think would be a helpful
 
07:11:58.110 --> 07:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
safety uh clarification uh and then
 
07:12:01.510 --> 07:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
finally uh the the third recommendation
 
07:12:05.948 --> 07:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
is um if the uh entity does upon their
 
07:12:07.910 --> 07:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
own accord decide they would like to
 
07:12:11.230 --> 07:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
interconnect to um the public
 
07:12:14.388 --> 07:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
utility uh that they need to pay uh any
 
07:12:15.868 --> 07:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
cost associated with that
 
07:12:18.270 --> 07:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
interconnection as I uh previously
 
07:12:19.830 --> 07:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
discussed we have to do quite a bit of
 
07:12:21.468 --> 07:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
engineering to make sure there isn't
 
07:12:24.910 --> 07:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
overloading uh all customers uh if we
 
07:12:26.948 --> 07:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
don't charge the interconnecting entity
 
07:12:28.788 --> 07:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
would be required to pay for that and I
 
07:12:30.990 --> 07:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't think uh that would be in keeping
 
07:12:33.310 --> 07:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
with with uh the you know long held
 
07:12:35.230 --> 07:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
views of the State of New Hampshire to
 
07:12:36.990 --> 07:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
to subsidize these
 
07:12:39.590 --> 07:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
interconnections uh again appreciate the
 
07:12:42.150 --> 07:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
the intent appreciate the the desire to
 
07:12:45.628 --> 07:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
add some specificity around um these
 
07:12:48.750 --> 07:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
off-grid uh providers and I'd be happy
 
07:12:53.190 --> 07:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:55.350 --> 07:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you questions
 
07:12:55.360 --> 07:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you questions
representative

07:12:56.750 --> 07:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:12:58.990 --> 07:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
Gorman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:13:02.310 --> 07:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
Mr lato always good to see you um I'm
 
07:13:05.110 --> 07:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
curious about the the provis Proviso
 
07:13:08.510 --> 07:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
that uh wires not uh cross roadways I'm
 
07:13:10.270 --> 07:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about the wildfires in
 
07:13:12.910 --> 07:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
California and uh that those were caused
 
07:13:15.150 --> 07:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
by electrical infrastructure any
 
07:13:17.070 --> 07:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
particular reason why it should just be
 
07:13:19.628 --> 07:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
restricted to not Crossing
 
07:13:23.468 --> 07:13:23.478 align:start position:0%
roadways so when when we uh looked at
 
07:13:26.468 --> 07:13:26.478 align:start position:0%
this bill what we believed the intention
 
07:13:33.070 --> 07:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
of it was uh was to make it clear C that
 
07:13:36.230 --> 07:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you own a piece of property um what
 
07:13:38.350 --> 07:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
you do on that property is is in some
 
07:13:41.230 --> 07:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
ways your business from a I'll say
 
07:13:45.070 --> 07:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
public utility standpoint obviously uh
 
07:13:47.150 --> 07:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
as as the sponsor made very clear there
 
07:13:49.468 --> 07:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
are you know environmental and and
 
07:13:53.468 --> 07:13:53.478 align:start position:0%
citing statutes that still apply and so
 
07:13:55.708 --> 07:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
our our view was you know if someone
 
07:13:58.388 --> 07:13:58.398 align:start position:0%
today wanted to put some source of
 
07:13:59.910 --> 07:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
generation in the middle of their
 
07:14:02.468 --> 07:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
property and build an industrial park
 
07:14:05.270 --> 07:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
around that and have agreements with
 
07:14:07.990 --> 07:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
their tenants um that everybody sort of
 
07:14:11.990 --> 07:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to then that is what this bill's
 
07:14:15.948 --> 07:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh trying to to enable and so uh again I
 
07:14:18.150 --> 07:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
think once you start Crossing roadways
 
07:14:22.350 --> 07:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
you start uh interconnecting with uh you
 
07:14:26.788 --> 07:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
know other Parcels uh that Cross Public
 
07:14:30.190 --> 07:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
rights of way then there is a a public
 
07:14:32.150 --> 07:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
safety issue and the standards that you
 
07:14:36.030 --> 07:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
build to and the emergency response come
 
07:14:38.468 --> 07:14:38.478 align:start position:0%
in follow
 
07:14:40.910 --> 07:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
up again I'm just thinking you know if
 
07:14:43.030 --> 07:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
there were a fire that happened because
 
07:14:46.230 --> 07:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
of this infrastructure that spreads it's
 
07:14:48.548 --> 07:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
it's no longer just necessarily on on
 
07:14:50.270 --> 07:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
that private property so wouldn't that
 
07:14:53.310 --> 07:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
be a public safety concern I I it's a
 
07:14:53.320 --> 07:14:56.030 align:start position:0%
be a public safety concern I I it's a
fair

07:14:56.030 --> 07:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:58.150 --> 07:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
statement okay other questions Vice
 
07:15:00.548 --> 07:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas thank you Mr chairman thank
 
07:15:04.270 --> 07:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm curious
 
07:15:07.070 --> 07:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
the interconnection however far or short
 
07:15:09.750 --> 07:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
it is would it be treated as
 
07:15:12.350 --> 07:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
transmission or
 
07:15:15.070 --> 07:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
distribution is the the question the
 
07:15:18.150 --> 07:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the utility well from
 
07:15:21.388 --> 07:15:21.398 align:start position:0%
the energy source to The Entity that is
 
07:15:25.110 --> 07:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
using that energy source sure I
 
07:15:29.350 --> 07:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
I it dep well so there would have to be
 
07:15:32.270 --> 07:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of steps in the process
 
07:15:34.830 --> 07:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the generator
 
07:15:38.230 --> 07:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation on size if it was
 
07:15:41.468 --> 07:15:41.478 align:start position:0%
um you know below a certain voltage uh
 
07:15:42.708 --> 07:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
and please don't ask me what that
 
07:15:45.430 --> 07:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
voltage might be uh you know it would
 
07:15:47.628 --> 07:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
have to then it would leave the
 
07:15:50.388 --> 07:15:50.398 align:start position:0%
generation facility get stepped down at
 
07:15:53.030 --> 07:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
a substation and then distributed
 
07:15:55.510 --> 07:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
through through distribution voltages
 
07:15:58.030 --> 07:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
because that's what the the customer
 
07:15:59.830 --> 07:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
typically would use but there are
 
07:16:02.190 --> 07:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we have very large
 
07:16:03.830 --> 07:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
industrial customers that take
 
07:16:06.110 --> 07:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
transmission voltages so there's just a
 
07:16:11.230 --> 07:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
lot of of possibilities in there on how
 
07:16:14.628 --> 07:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
the voltage of the the generator and the
 
07:16:17.548 --> 07:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
needs of whatever entity is
 
07:16:20.548 --> 07:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
interconnecting to it apologize not
 
07:16:22.830 --> 07:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
being able to give you a specific answer
 
07:16:24.670 --> 07:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
but there's just a lot of variables in
 
07:16:27.868 --> 07:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
there representative McGee thank you Mr
 
07:16:29.708 --> 07:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr lado for taking my
 
07:16:32.990 --> 07:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
question so so um my question is also
 
07:16:35.468 --> 07:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
about the
 
07:16:38.670 --> 07:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess the safety of the electricity
 
07:16:41.788 --> 07:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
itself of
 
07:16:44.910 --> 07:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
um the I I feel like the bill I
 
07:16:46.948 --> 07:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
understand what it's trying to do um but
 
07:16:48.628 --> 07:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
I feel like it doesn't have enough
 
07:16:48.638 --> 07:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
I feel like it doesn't have enough
definition

07:16:49.830 --> 07:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
07:16:54.868 --> 07:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
around limits Pilots um or parameters
 
07:16:56.430 --> 07:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
which makes it seem a little bit like
 
07:16:59.670 --> 07:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
the Wild Wild West um I would I would
 
07:17:02.590 --> 07:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
like you to comment on being an
 
07:17:05.830 --> 07:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
electricity provider I know that there's
 
07:17:08.110 --> 07:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
a a complicated system of phasing
 
07:17:11.990 --> 07:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
electricity on and off the system and um
 
07:17:13.468 --> 07:17:13.478 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you could comment
 
07:17:16.070 --> 07:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
on any thoughts you might have around
 
07:17:17.868 --> 07:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
the safety of
 
07:17:21.590 --> 07:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
having large unlimited uh electricity
 
07:17:25.270 --> 07:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
providers who are unregulated so that
 
07:17:28.030 --> 07:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
nobody has a sense of whether or not the
 
07:17:30.590 --> 07:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
energy that they're producing and moving
 
07:17:32.548 --> 07:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
is is actually done in a safe
 
07:17:37.350 --> 07:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
way uh I understand and appreciate the
 
07:17:39.670 --> 07:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
question I think you know ever source is
 
07:17:42.910 --> 07:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this from our perspective and
 
07:17:46.830 --> 07:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh an entity uh provider of
 
07:17:48.830 --> 07:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
electricity that we are not
 
07:17:54.310 --> 07:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
interconnected to and so um the safety
 
07:17:57.230 --> 07:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
the how they manage uh their system
 
07:18:00.070 --> 07:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be separate and distinct uh from
 
07:18:02.708 --> 07:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
us and that would be a you know a public
 
07:18:04.788 --> 07:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
policy consideration of the State of New
 
07:18:07.430 --> 07:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how much um you know I I would
 
07:18:10.750 --> 07:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
argue that the regulations in statute
 
07:18:13.548 --> 07:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
exist for a reason uh we have to comply
 
07:18:17.150 --> 07:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
with with all of them uh and there's
 
07:18:21.830 --> 07:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
certainly I believe a a balance that uh
 
07:18:23.788 --> 07:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
you as policy makers need to strike
 
07:18:26.910 --> 07:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
between trying to remove regulation to
 
07:18:29.788 --> 07:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
advance Innovation and keep a certain
 
07:18:32.468 --> 07:18:32.478 align:start position:0%
amount of Regulation to for the reasons
 
07:18:35.430 --> 07:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
they were put into place to begin
 
07:18:37.708 --> 07:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
07:18:40.110 --> 07:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and I I do
 
07:18:41.468 --> 07:18:41.478 align:start position:0%
have another question about the first
 
07:18:43.670 --> 07:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
thing you listed about the U about not
 
07:18:46.628 --> 07:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
allowing an interconnection between the
 
07:18:49.590 --> 07:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh the off grid provider and the
 
07:18:53.388 --> 07:18:53.398 align:start position:0%
grid is it possible to have a customer
 
07:18:56.750 --> 07:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
facility that is connected to both but
 
07:18:59.708 --> 07:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
at separate times or is it just not even
 
07:19:01.788 --> 07:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
possible that the fact fact that there's
 
07:19:03.548 --> 07:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
a connection to one and a connection to
 
07:19:07.030 --> 07:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
the other inherently means that the uh
 
07:19:09.270 --> 07:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
off-grid provider actually is somehow
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
connected to the
 
07:19:13.350 --> 07:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
grid uh
 
07:19:16.750 --> 07:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
so if if it is interconnected to our
 
07:19:19.548 --> 07:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
system if it there is a customer on this
 
07:19:21.548 --> 07:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
system that is also interconnected to
 
07:19:24.670 --> 07:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
the um distribution or transmission
 
07:19:27.548 --> 07:19:27.558 align:start position:0%
system they are interconnected and and I
 
07:19:27.558 --> 07:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
system they are interconnected and and I
think

07:19:29.350 --> 07:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:19:33.190 --> 07:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh as previously stated if they need to
 
07:19:35.788 --> 07:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
rely on the utility for either primary
 
07:19:37.830 --> 07:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
or Backup
 
07:19:42.388 --> 07:19:42.398 align:start position:0%
Service the um the electric utility
 
07:19:46.310 --> 07:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
needs to design its system to safely
 
07:19:49.510 --> 07:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate that and there can be cost
 
07:19:51.270 --> 07:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
depending on where this is obviously
 
07:19:54.030 --> 07:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
cited uh there can be cost associated
 
07:19:56.830 --> 07:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
with that um with that uh
 
07:19:59.510 --> 07:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
interconnection as well as obviously the
 
07:20:02.468 --> 07:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
ongoing cost of of providing electricity
 
07:20:05.430 --> 07:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
service that all customers uh pay into
 
07:20:09.190 --> 07:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
and enjoy today follow up follow up yeah
 
07:20:10.788 --> 07:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know if I understood the
 
07:20:14.270 --> 07:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
answer I mean so if if there's an
 
07:20:16.510 --> 07:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
offgrid connection to a customer and an
 
07:20:18.788 --> 07:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
on grid connection to the
 
07:20:21.788 --> 07:20:21.798 align:start position:0%
customer are those two necessarily
 
07:20:24.750 --> 07:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
somehow connected and and
 
07:20:26.830 --> 07:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
therefore you have a real problem with
 
07:20:28.990 --> 07:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
that or is it possible to actually
 
07:20:31.788 --> 07:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
physically disconnect so so that the
 
07:20:33.948 --> 07:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
off- grid connection is not actually
 
07:20:36.628 --> 07:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
connected to the
 
07:20:39.350 --> 07:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
grid I guess my response is if it is
 
07:20:41.468 --> 07:20:41.478 align:start position:0%
interconnected at any point in time to
 
07:20:44.230 --> 07:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
our system it is connected to our
 
07:20:46.990 --> 07:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
system we need to design the system to
 
07:20:48.628 --> 07:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
07:20:50.830 --> 07:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
interconnection okay I have no more pink
 
07:20:52.430 --> 07:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
cards on this I want to thank you for
 
07:20:55.670 --> 07:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony and we will close the
 
07:20:59.590 --> 07:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 672 and open a public
 
07:21:03.230 --> 07:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on how Bill 690 and I'll call on
 
07:21:05.070 --> 07:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
representative James Summers to
 
07:21:21.548 --> 07:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:24.150 --> 07:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
 
07:21:33.110 --> 07:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:33.120 --> 07:21:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
let's

07:21:36.990 --> 07:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:39.388 --> 07:21:39.398 align:start position:0%
see thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
07:21:42.948 --> 07:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the for my fellow committee members
 
07:21:46.030 --> 07:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
to uh uh listen to me uh introduce this
 
07:21:48.230 --> 07:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill it's HB 690
 
07:21:52.708 --> 07:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
FN um this bill is actually basically a
 
07:21:56.350 --> 07:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
conglomerate of well A reproduction of a
 
07:21:58.150 --> 07:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill that's come across this committee
 
07:22:00.750 --> 07:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
many times over the last decade in
 
07:22:03.548 --> 07:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
different forms um it's been whether
 
07:22:06.310 --> 07:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's been a asking for a commission or a
 
07:22:08.468 --> 07:22:08.478 align:start position:0%
committee this is actually looking into
 
07:22:11.628 --> 07:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
different way we're um now that we have
 
07:22:14.350 --> 07:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
as of beginning of last term Department
 
07:22:16.990 --> 07:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
of energy within the within the
 
07:22:18.628 --> 07:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
government we uh this is actually
 
07:22:21.708 --> 07:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
looking at the department of energy to
 
07:22:25.230 --> 07:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
actually investigate and to finally to
 
07:22:27.350 --> 07:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
allow us to get the answers that we've
 
07:22:30.590 --> 07:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
been looking for for a decade basically
 
07:22:35.070 --> 07:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to ISO New England now part
 
07:22:37.590 --> 07:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
one of this bill is predominantly the
 
07:22:39.750 --> 07:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions and if you notice they both go
 
07:22:42.270 --> 07:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
both ways what's the benefits to be on
 
07:22:44.590 --> 07:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
it what's the benefits to separate
 
07:22:47.350 --> 07:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
what's the benefits of of cost how much
 
07:22:50.750 --> 07:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
would it cost if we left how what um
 
07:22:52.468 --> 07:22:52.478 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits of leaving is New
 
07:22:54.350 --> 07:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
England what are the costs associated
 
07:22:56.548 --> 07:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
with leaving is New England would there
 
07:22:59.590 --> 07:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
be reliability impacts if we left would
 
07:23:01.590 --> 07:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
there be cost ass assciated with that
 
07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
that could be avoided by um New
 
07:23:06.230 --> 07:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we to leave and what are
 
07:23:08.948 --> 07:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
the benefits of par participating in I
 
07:23:11.990 --> 07:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
New England so it's looking at both
 
07:23:14.910 --> 07:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
sides doing a um basically a cost
 
07:23:18.030 --> 07:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis a com direct comparison
 
07:23:20.548 --> 07:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
to and it's instead of a commission or
 
07:23:22.230 --> 07:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee being developed it's having
 
07:23:23.868 --> 07:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
the department of energy actually look
 
07:23:28.628 --> 07:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
at this and investigate it um while and
 
07:23:30.430 --> 07:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
where this kind of came up earlier this
 
07:23:32.070 --> 07:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
term as well is we were talking about
 
07:23:34.388 --> 07:23:34.398 align:start position:0%
the while New Hampshire as we mentioned
 
07:23:37.548 --> 07:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
by Doe earlier when we doing the uh
 
07:23:39.628 --> 07:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
evaluations and and discussions with
 
07:23:41.150 --> 07:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
them when we first started the committee
 
07:23:43.548 --> 07:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
this term uh when they brought up that
 
07:23:46.708 --> 07:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
while New Hampshire generates almost uh
 
07:23:49.708 --> 07:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
double the power it uses 177% compared
 
07:23:54.788 --> 07:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
to 10% load uh how are we affected by um
 
07:23:56.868 --> 07:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
these policies how can that Surplus be
 
07:23:59.070 --> 07:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
used would that benefit us if we were to
 
07:24:02.270 --> 07:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
separate how are affected by the
 
07:24:04.190 --> 07:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures of the other
 
07:24:06.948 --> 07:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
states within ISO New England how when
 
07:24:08.948 --> 07:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
they make a policy change how are we
 
07:24:11.788 --> 07:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
affected or if we not affected um how is
 
07:24:15.830 --> 07:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
the um and it was brought up actually um
 
07:24:18.350 --> 07:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
another final note is that the uh this
 
07:24:20.230 --> 07:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
past Friday within the emergency
 
07:24:23.308 --> 07:24:23.318 align:start position:0%
technology caucus bipartisan group uh we
 
07:24:25.868 --> 07:24:25.878 align:start position:0%
gathered together talk about different
 
07:24:28.990 --> 07:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies um in relationship to uh
 
07:24:32.308 --> 07:24:32.318 align:start position:0%
energy producers energy generation and
 
07:24:34.670 --> 07:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
the State Surplus and we looked at the
 
07:24:37.468 --> 07:24:37.478 align:start position:0%
opportunities discussed utilizing the
 
07:24:38.990 --> 07:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
surplus of power and how it would
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
benefit us if we were to separate and
 
07:24:44.430 --> 07:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
how they if it would cost us more to be
 
07:24:46.910 --> 07:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
on our own or if we get the benefit from
 
07:24:48.830 --> 07:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
ISO New England to where it does benefit
 
07:24:54.030 --> 07:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
us already and so um that's pretty much
 
07:24:56.230 --> 07:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what the uh the bill
 
07:24:58.670 --> 07:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
actually is I'll take any
 
07:25:01.830 --> 07:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions questions for for the
 
07:25:04.468 --> 07:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
07:25:07.070 --> 07:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr
 
07:25:09.388 --> 07:25:09.398 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you representative
 
07:25:11.750 --> 07:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
Summers for taking my question
 
07:25:15.948 --> 07:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
um when you say things like New
 
07:25:15.958 --> 07:25:17.230 align:start position:0%
um when you say things like New
Hampshire

07:25:17.230 --> 07:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:25:21.430 --> 07:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
generates 17% of the energy that goes to
 
07:25:26.190 --> 07:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and that we have a state
 
07:25:29.590 --> 07:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
Surplus do you understand that the
 
07:25:29.600 --> 07:25:31.270 align:start position:0%
Surplus do you understand that the
generator

07:25:31.270 --> 07:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
generator
 
07:25:34.030 --> 07:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
the electric generators that may be
 
07:25:35.910 --> 07:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
located in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:25:38.990 --> 07:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
are private entities
 
07:25:39.000 --> 07:25:40.510 align:start position:0%
are private entities
and

07:25:40.510 --> 07:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:25:45.110 --> 07:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that that the energy they produce is not
 
07:25:45.120 --> 07:25:46.510 align:start position:0%
that that the energy they produce is not
belong

07:25:46.510 --> 07:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
belong
 
07:25:49.430 --> 07:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the state of New
 
07:25:51.788 --> 07:25:51.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes yes I understand that
 
07:25:54.030 --> 07:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
correctly it is um what I'm basically
 
07:25:56.350 --> 07:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
utilizing there is that the the
 
07:25:58.990 --> 07:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
generators that currently even because
 
07:26:01.510 --> 07:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
they do sell contracts to other states I
 
07:26:03.510 --> 07:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
understand that right now for example
 
07:26:05.030 --> 07:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
CBR I believe has a contract with
 
07:26:06.948 --> 07:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
Connecticut still so much their power to
 
07:26:10.670 --> 07:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
it um but what I'm utilizing is how much
 
07:26:15.230 --> 07:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
power by Divi by um sites within the
 
07:26:17.468 --> 07:26:17.478 align:start position:0%
state how much they generate and then
 
07:26:20.388 --> 07:26:20.398 align:start position:0%
how much is utilized by the state itself
 
07:26:20.398 --> 07:26:22.230 align:start position:0%
how much is utilized by the state itself
is

07:26:22.230 --> 07:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:26:24.990 --> 07:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
really right thank
 
07:26:28.150 --> 07:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
07:26:29.830 --> 07:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
07:26:33.750 --> 07:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
introduc ucing this bill um my attention
 
07:26:36.150 --> 07:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
is drawn to line four and five lines
 
07:26:38.868 --> 07:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
four and five where it says that the
 
07:26:40.590 --> 07:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from ISO New England and
 
07:26:43.350 --> 07:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
other strategies to insulate rate payers
 
07:26:46.308 --> 07:26:46.318 align:start position:0%
from costs associated with New England's
 
07:26:48.628 --> 07:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
Environmental Policy can you please
 
07:26:51.030 --> 07:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
define New England's environmental
 
07:26:52.350 --> 07:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
policy and what are you talking about
 
07:26:53.830 --> 07:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
here what I was trying to get it there
 
07:26:56.708 --> 07:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
was the the differences of States so I
 
07:26:59.350 --> 07:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
know I bar briefly engage that but
 
07:27:01.430 --> 07:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not that um it's basically
 
07:27:03.030 --> 07:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
asking getting to and asking the
 
07:27:05.150 --> 07:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
question of the policies in other states
 
07:27:07.510 --> 07:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
the other five states within New England
 
07:27:10.190 --> 07:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
they if their policy change actually
 
07:27:12.350 --> 07:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly affect the rates
 
07:27:13.948 --> 07:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
that we pay in New
 
07:27:15.628 --> 07:27:15.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if it's their
 
07:27:16.948 --> 07:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
environmental policies that they
 
07:27:19.708 --> 07:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
Implement if they affect the rates and
 
07:27:22.110 --> 07:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
directly or
 
07:27:25.830 --> 07:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
indirectly followup followup so is that
 
07:27:29.430 --> 07:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
actually a a one of the questions that
 
07:27:31.388 --> 07:27:31.398 align:start position:0%
the that the
 
07:27:33.910 --> 07:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee would look at is that one of
 
07:27:37.590 --> 07:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
should it be under the the the questions
 
07:27:39.990 --> 07:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
that you've identified instead of up up
 
07:27:43.510 --> 07:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
there I I believe it is um I'm looking
 
07:27:43.520 --> 07:27:44.948 align:start position:0%
there I I believe it is um I'm looking
for

07:27:44.948 --> 07:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:27:48.030 --> 07:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
here lines four and five
 
07:27:50.548 --> 07:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a generalization of what the
 
07:27:52.708 --> 07:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
investigation is going to cover um but
 
07:27:54.150 --> 07:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's covered again I believe I thought
 
07:27:58.868 --> 07:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:02.030 --> 07:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
07:28:02.040 --> 07:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
um uh
looking

07:28:02.790 --> 07:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
looking
 
07:28:02.800 --> 07:28:05.628 align:start position:0%
looking
[Music]

07:28:05.628 --> 07:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:28:07.510 --> 07:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
for I thought there was a question
 
07:28:09.868 --> 07:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
asking about that but maybe
 
07:28:09.878 --> 07:28:15.430 align:start position:0%
asking about that but maybe
not

07:28:15.430 --> 07:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:19.270 --> 07:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
um oh um sorry thank you um would there
 
07:28:21.350 --> 07:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
be cost associated with IC New England
 
07:28:22.948 --> 07:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
that could be avoided even if New
 
07:28:25.430 --> 07:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to leave uh line I even
 
07:28:33.548 --> 07:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:34.910 --> 07:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
07:28:37.510 --> 07:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee thank you
 
07:28:39.628 --> 07:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
07:28:41.830 --> 07:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
Summers for taking my question so my
 
07:28:45.190 --> 07:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
question is around um whether you have
 
07:28:49.430 --> 07:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
any information on how much Reliance we
 
07:28:51.910 --> 07:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
have on the flow of energy from the
 
07:28:54.070 --> 07:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
transmission lines that are part of the
 
07:28:56.868 --> 07:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
grid if if you have any understanding of
 
07:28:58.590 --> 07:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
um you
 
07:29:02.070 --> 07:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
know how much rely on that energy going
 
07:29:03.548 --> 07:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
through transmission lines that run
 
07:29:05.110 --> 07:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
through the state of New Hampshire
 
07:29:07.070 --> 07:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
because if we pull out we I guess we
 
07:29:08.708 --> 07:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use them anymore I
 
07:29:10.190 --> 07:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
mean I don't even understand how it
 
07:29:12.708 --> 07:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
would work I guess that's the question
 
07:29:15.628 --> 07:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
um my personally I I do not and that's
 
07:29:18.270 --> 07:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
why um I believe this investigation
 
07:29:20.110 --> 07:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
would actually bring out a lot of the
 
07:29:21.670 --> 07:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions that we actually been looking
 
07:29:23.990 --> 07:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
for and to basically explain that so
 
07:29:26.708 --> 07:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
that we would know the limitations of
 
07:29:28.510 --> 07:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
could we do this or could we
 
07:29:30.948 --> 07:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
not thank you additional
 
07:29:30.958 --> 07:29:32.468 align:start position:0%
not thank you additional
questions

07:29:32.468 --> 07:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:29:35.628 --> 07:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
seeing representative Corman thank you
 
07:29:37.270 --> 07:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative
 
07:29:41.430 --> 07:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
Summers um in terms of um duplicative
 
07:29:44.830 --> 07:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
functions on line 16 uh I didn't get to
 
07:29:48.270 --> 07:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
go see the iso control room but uh
 
07:29:50.868 --> 07:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we definitely need our own
 
07:29:50.878 --> 07:29:53.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we definitely need our own
control

07:29:53.590 --> 07:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:56.388 --> 07:29:56.398 align:start position:0%
room that's very possible that we would
 
07:29:59.270 --> 07:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
and that was but again that was the uh
 
07:30:01.110 --> 07:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
again that's just it's basically asking
 
07:30:02.990 --> 07:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
the question if we would what would be
 
07:30:04.670 --> 07:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the size and scale of that how would it
 
07:30:06.230 --> 07:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
be compared to ISO what would the cost
 
07:30:09.190 --> 07:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
of that be compared to what we um what
 
07:30:12.190 --> 07:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
the costs are now being a member of
 
07:30:15.750 --> 07:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
iso rep representative Swanson thank you
 
07:30:18.510 --> 07:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you Mr Summers or
 
07:30:21.030 --> 07:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative Summers sorry uh
 
07:30:23.708 --> 07:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
regarding the original decis there must
 
07:30:26.110 --> 07:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
have was there an original decision to
 
07:30:30.750 --> 07:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:33.750 --> 07:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
at some point in time several years
 
07:30:36.270 --> 07:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
ago honestly I don't I don't know the
 
07:30:38.110 --> 07:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
answer I'm assuming yes but I I don't
 
07:30:39.948 --> 07:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
know that answer I'd have
 
07:30:44.230 --> 07:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
to follow up so assuming there was
 
07:30:46.590 --> 07:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
originally a decision that was made some
 
07:30:48.750 --> 07:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
considerations had to have been or
 
07:30:50.430 --> 07:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
Alternatives had to be
 
07:30:53.308 --> 07:30:53.318 align:start position:0%
considered uh presumably if we're going
 
07:30:55.628 --> 07:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
to investigate pulling out wouldn't we
 
07:30:58.230 --> 07:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
look at why we got in in the first
 
07:31:00.948 --> 07:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
place we could definitely look at that
 
07:31:03.350 --> 07:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
however what the uh and it's possible
 
07:31:05.510 --> 07:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
that when they went into ISO New England
 
07:31:08.350 --> 07:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
it was that New England was seen as a a
 
07:31:10.150 --> 07:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
conglomerate where they had the same
 
07:31:11.910 --> 07:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
beliefs of what they were for what they
 
07:31:13.868 --> 07:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
were against and as policies have
 
07:31:16.070 --> 07:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
changed over the years that quite
 
07:31:18.308 --> 07:31:18.318 align:start position:0%
possible that states differ in what they
 
07:31:19.750 --> 07:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
believe is important what should be
 
07:31:22.388 --> 07:31:22.398 align:start position:0%
covered and what shouldn't be thank you
 
07:31:24.308 --> 07:31:24.318 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
07:31:26.070 --> 07:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation we have three other
 
07:31:27.708 --> 07:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
folks that would like to comment on it
 
07:31:29.548 --> 07:31:29.558 align:start position:0%
before we have to be kicked out of the
 
07:31:32.590 --> 07:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
room so Donald C you're up next to give
 
07:31:34.750 --> 07:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
us your perspective on this legislation
 
07:31:37.388 --> 07:31:37.398 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr chairman with
 
07:31:39.708 --> 07:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
your leave I have a just a little piece
 
07:31:42.150 --> 07:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
of artwork to distribute to members of
 
07:31:42.160 --> 07:31:52.110 align:start position:0%
of artwork to distribute to members of
the

07:31:52.110 --> 07:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:54.110 --> 07:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh let me just say again that
 
07:31:56.308 --> 07:31:56.318 align:start position:0%
I'm Donald Cree the consumer Advocate we
 
07:31:57.670 --> 07:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of residential
 
07:32:00.350 --> 07:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
utility customers I am testifying
 
07:32:03.510 --> 07:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of House Bill 690 and I would
 
07:32:05.308 --> 07:32:05.318 align:start position:0%
like to commend the sponsor for
 
07:32:09.030 --> 07:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting an inquiry of this uh nature
 
07:32:11.788 --> 07:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
and the questions that uh some or many
 
07:32:14.388 --> 07:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
of you have been asking so far uh go
 
07:32:16.548 --> 07:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
directly to why I think this kind of
 
07:32:18.628 --> 07:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
Investigation would be useful what I've
 
07:32:20.510 --> 07:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
given you and the reason I characterize
 
07:32:23.350 --> 07:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
it as artwork is that if you look at
 
07:32:25.030 --> 07:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
these are two slides that I got from
 
07:32:27.468 --> 07:32:27.478 align:start position:0%
neol which is the uh stakeholder
 
07:32:30.070 --> 07:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
advisory body to ISO New England and the
 
07:32:33.990 --> 07:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
one that's marked uh page 64 uh reminds
 
07:32:36.590 --> 07:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
me of Picasso's gika which is why I
 
07:32:38.548 --> 07:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
called it artwork and and the point I'm
 
07:32:41.670 --> 07:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
making is that ISO New England a and
 
07:32:46.388 --> 07:32:46.398 align:start position:0%
neol and all of the uh Arrangements that
 
07:32:49.548 --> 07:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
underly and enable are so Byzantine and
 
07:32:52.830 --> 07:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
complicated that few if any of us
 
07:32:54.910 --> 07:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
understand them well enough to know
 
07:32:57.510 --> 07:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
whether our state is well served by
 
07:32:59.308 --> 07:32:59.318 align:start position:0%
perpetuating these Arrangements they did
 
07:33:02.030 --> 07:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
not all come into existence all at once
 
07:33:05.270 --> 07:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
they are the sum total of a series of
 
07:33:07.510 --> 07:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
events some fortunate some unfortunate
 
07:33:09.430 --> 07:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
that probably began either with the
 
07:33:11.628 --> 07:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
invention of electricity or more
 
07:33:14.868 --> 07:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
approximately with the 1965 New York
 
07:33:16.990 --> 07:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
blackout which led to the creation of
 
07:33:19.868 --> 07:33:19.878 align:start position:0%
Nee poool as a tight power pool and so
 
07:33:21.830 --> 07:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
you've seen this accretion of
 
07:33:24.350 --> 07:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
Arrangements I think they all are in
 
07:33:27.548 --> 07:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
place to favor the Legacy interests
 
07:33:29.468 --> 07:33:29.478 align:start position:0%
which is to say the big investor owned
 
07:33:32.910 --> 07:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
company ianes that built our uh Legacy
 
07:33:35.150 --> 07:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
generators and our Legacy transmission
 
07:33:37.230 --> 07:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
system so I think it would be really
 
07:33:39.230 --> 07:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
useful to conduct a thorough
 
07:33:41.070 --> 07:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
investigation into the question of
 
07:33:43.548 --> 07:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire truly is well
 
07:33:46.070 --> 07:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
served by perpetuating something this
 
07:33:48.510 --> 07:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
Byzantine and complicated if I have a
 
07:33:51.270 --> 07:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
legal question say if I want to research
 
07:33:53.548 --> 07:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
how how has the Pu treated a particular
 
07:33:56.150 --> 07:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
question over the years since the Pu was
 
07:33:58.750 --> 07:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
started in about 1911 I actually can do
 
07:34:00.750 --> 07:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
that I have a great legal database at my
 
07:34:03.350 --> 07:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
disposal I can search every pu order
 
07:34:05.270 --> 07:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
ever written and I can generally come up
 
07:34:07.548 --> 07:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
with an answer if I want to know like
 
07:34:09.270 --> 07:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's really going on like how did we
 
07:34:11.110 --> 07:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
get here with all of this and what does
 
07:34:13.788 --> 07:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
it all really mean I I can't do the same
 
07:34:16.070 --> 07:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
thing it's that complicated nobody
 
07:34:18.308 --> 07:34:18.318 align:start position:0%
really understands it now let me just be
 
07:34:21.750 --> 07:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
clear I would be very surprised if at
 
07:34:24.468 --> 07:34:24.478 align:start position:0%
the end of an investigation like this uh
 
07:34:26.230 --> 07:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
with the results coming back to you what
 
07:34:28.388 --> 07:34:28.398 align:start position:0%
this state would decide is absolutely we
 
07:34:31.110 --> 07:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
must withdraw from ISO New England that
 
07:34:34.948 --> 07:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
would require us to Island our grid from
 
07:34:37.150 --> 07:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and I think we would find
 
07:34:40.030 --> 07:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly that that is Impractical
 
07:34:41.708 --> 07:34:41.718 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean this inquiry
 
07:34:43.990 --> 07:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be worthwhile to determine
 
07:34:45.990 --> 07:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether there are improvements that we
 
07:34:48.388 --> 07:34:48.398 align:start position:0%
could make to the arrangements whereby
 
07:34:51.070 --> 07:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
we trade back uh power back and forth
 
07:34:53.230 --> 07:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
and interconnect back and forth with all
 
07:34:55.708 --> 07:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
of our neighbors both fellow States and
 
07:34:57.948 --> 07:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
with the Canadian provinces that are
 
07:35:01.308 --> 07:35:01.318 align:start position:0%
also interconnected with us so excuse me
 
07:35:02.868 --> 07:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
I think the Bill's a good idea and I
 
07:35:04.430 --> 07:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Summers for
 
07:35:06.110 --> 07:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
introducing it I think all of his
 
07:35:08.308 --> 07:35:08.318 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns are valid and
 
07:35:10.990 --> 07:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
deserve answers that's all I have to say
 
07:35:13.868 --> 07:35:13.878 align:start position:0%
I think okay well thank you questions
 
07:35:17.150 --> 07:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:19.910 --> 07:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill well looks like nobody has one so
 
07:35:23.190 --> 07:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
next we'll bring up um Chris Elms and
 
07:35:25.670 --> 07:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
Dan failen from the Department of energy
 
07:35:27.788 --> 07:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
to give us their take on this
 
07:35:27.798 --> 07:35:35.230 align:start position:0%
to give us their take on this
legislation

07:35:35.230 --> 07:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:36.468 --> 07:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
07:35:38.150 --> 07:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record uh Chris
 
07:35:39.430 --> 07:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
Elms Deputy Commissioner of the New
 
07:35:40.830 --> 07:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy joined by
 
07:35:44.628 --> 07:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
Dan faen Regional policy director um the
 
07:35:46.628 --> 07:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
Department's neutral on House Bill 690
 
07:35:48.430 --> 07:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
but if we are directed to pursue the
 
07:35:51.388 --> 07:35:51.398 align:start position:0%
investigation we would do so happily uh
 
07:35:52.708 --> 07:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Echo a lot of what the
 
07:35:55.388 --> 07:35:55.398 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate said um and and just
 
07:35:57.030 --> 07:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
say we are in a really interesting time
 
07:35:59.190 --> 07:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the New England uh energy policy
 
07:35:59.200 --> 07:36:00.270 align:start position:0%
in the New England uh energy policy
sphere

07:36:00.270 --> 07:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
sphere
 
07:36:01.830 --> 07:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh a lot happening with our evolving
 
07:36:03.510 --> 07:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
resource mix with making the right
 
07:36:06.190 --> 07:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
Investments whether we can build stuff
 
07:36:08.230 --> 07:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh even the attitude to how we should
 
07:36:10.468 --> 07:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
approach uh electricity procurement in
 
07:36:13.468 --> 07:36:13.478 align:start position:0%
the first place um as we've mentioned
 
07:36:15.910 --> 07:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
State Statute directs the the department
 
07:36:17.510 --> 07:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
of energy to advocate for New
 
07:36:19.708 --> 07:36:19.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's policy goals and against
 
07:36:21.190 --> 07:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
proposed policies of other states that
 
07:36:22.868 --> 07:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
would shift cost to New
 
07:36:25.750 --> 07:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um provided that those
 
07:36:28.590 --> 07:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
policies are not in in our policy
 
07:36:31.350 --> 07:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
portfolio um you know we've talked a lot
 
07:36:32.788 --> 07:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
about how New Hampshire is unique in the
 
07:36:34.868 --> 07:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
region we undeniably have different
 
07:36:37.230 --> 07:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
goals uh every other state has
 
07:36:39.868 --> 07:36:39.878 align:start position:0%
aggressive decarbonization goals well
 
07:36:41.990 --> 07:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
our Focus has been on cost and
 
07:36:44.670 --> 07:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
affordability um we have been really
 
07:36:46.788 --> 07:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
Market driven for long time but as we've
 
07:36:50.388 --> 07:36:50.398 align:start position:0%
seen uh both in in uh recent years and
 
07:36:52.230 --> 07:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh in bills proposed uh in this
 
07:36:55.468 --> 07:36:55.478 align:start position:0%
committee and in the Senate whether it's
 
07:36:57.910 --> 07:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh expanding power purchase agreements
 
07:37:02.230 --> 07:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
or um exploring energy storage uh you
 
07:37:05.070 --> 07:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
know credits utility ownership of
 
07:37:07.070 --> 07:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear I think there is a lot of
 
07:37:09.388 --> 07:37:09.398 align:start position:0%
questions about whether or not the the
 
07:37:11.110 --> 07:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure that we have today
 
07:37:14.230 --> 07:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
is working as designed um as
 
07:37:17.070 --> 07:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Summers mentioned we uh
 
07:37:18.708 --> 07:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
consume about 10% of New Hampshire's
 
07:37:20.788 --> 07:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
load while we within state borders
 
07:37:23.510 --> 07:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
generate about 177% so the question I
 
07:37:25.030 --> 07:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is asking is a good
 
07:37:27.468 --> 07:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
one uh is this working for New Hampshire
 
07:37:29.190 --> 07:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
is being part of the New England grid
 
07:37:31.590 --> 07:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire um you know
 
07:37:33.070 --> 07:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard time and time again about
 
07:37:35.030 --> 07:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
how difficult withdrawal would be from a
 
07:37:37.788 --> 07:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
cost technical legal regulatory
 
07:37:40.150 --> 07:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
practical perspective uh undoubtedly
 
07:37:42.350 --> 07:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
those would be really really big
 
07:37:44.070 --> 07:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties but what are they can we
 
07:37:45.708 --> 07:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
put numbers on them can we do that
 
07:37:48.430 --> 07:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
analysis figure out what's uh
 
07:37:50.350 --> 07:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
surmountable what's insurmountable and
 
07:37:53.468 --> 07:37:53.478 align:start position:0%
what lessons can we learn um I have no
 
07:37:54.750 --> 07:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
doubt there will be value in
 
07:37:56.788 --> 07:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
investigating it again the folks at ISO
 
07:37:58.468 --> 07:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
New England I think they do a a really
 
07:38:00.190 --> 07:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
good job really smart folks who have a
 
07:38:02.830 --> 07:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
hard hard job the question is whether or
 
07:38:05.110 --> 07:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
not the regional approach makes sense
 
07:38:08.308 --> 07:38:08.318 align:start position:0%
for us um these questions are great uh
 
07:38:09.868 --> 07:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there are costs
 
07:38:12.110 --> 07:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
associated with the investigation such
 
07:38:13.868 --> 07:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
as for specialized Consultants which
 
07:38:15.948 --> 07:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
might be necessary we do think our
 
07:38:18.430 --> 07:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
current statutes uh give us authority to
 
07:38:21.708 --> 07:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
to pay for those under RSA 36537 so that
 
07:38:24.910 --> 07:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
should be uh that should be fine um
 
07:38:26.830 --> 07:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
07:38:28.990 --> 07:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chair Thomas has a
 
07:38:30.510 --> 07:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
question for for you thank you Mr
 
07:38:31.910 --> 07:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
07:38:34.590 --> 07:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
question do if this bill have passed
 
07:38:38.750 --> 07:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
does this bill give you the authority to
 
07:38:41.150 --> 07:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
petition the utilities in state and
 
07:38:44.670 --> 07:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
inquire about how they would react to
 
07:38:47.110 --> 07:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular the eversource
 
07:38:49.510 --> 07:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
command center which is second to none
 
07:38:52.388 --> 07:38:52.398 align:start position:0%
after ISO New England's Command Center I
 
07:38:54.150 --> 07:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
I think my general council's back there
 
07:38:55.270 --> 07:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and he could talk about the legal
 
07:38:56.948 --> 07:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
authorities I would imagine that that
 
07:38:58.230 --> 07:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
the utilities and a whole bunch of
 
07:38:59.948 --> 07:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
stakeholders would be really interested
 
07:39:02.350 --> 07:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
in providing their perspective to us
 
07:39:04.070 --> 07:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh the utilization of
 
07:39:06.750 --> 07:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or opportunities for
 
07:39:08.868 --> 07:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
further success uh drawbacks they might
 
07:39:10.548 --> 07:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
see so I don't think it would be a
 
07:39:14.110 --> 07:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:17.628 --> 07:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
table representative Kaplan thank you Mr
 
07:39:19.628 --> 07:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you gentlemen once
 
07:39:22.510 --> 07:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
again um I I wanted to ask the the
 
07:39:23.750 --> 07:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill this question but I
 
07:39:25.388 --> 07:39:25.398 align:start position:0%
didn't get the chance so maybe you can
 
07:39:27.750 --> 07:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
answer it for me usually when there's a
 
07:39:30.670 --> 07:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
study committee there is some vision of
 
07:39:33.948 --> 07:39:33.958 align:start position:0%
some sort of outcome or Target or goal
 
07:39:36.510 --> 07:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
or just some kind of picture of where it
 
07:39:38.628 --> 07:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
might go can you provide that for us
 
07:39:41.350 --> 07:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
because otherwise this just an academic
 
07:39:43.468 --> 07:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
exercise it's a really really great
 
07:39:44.430 --> 07:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much
 
07:39:46.190 --> 07:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative and you know it's it's
 
07:39:47.788 --> 07:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
one of those things that especially as
 
07:39:49.670 --> 07:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Department's been created and that
 
07:39:51.910 --> 07:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
investigative Authority that we have has
 
07:39:54.510 --> 07:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
been explored and I think you know the
 
07:39:56.388 --> 07:39:56.398 align:start position:0%
this committee and and and uh the Senate
 
07:39:58.670 --> 07:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
have directed us to undergo a number of
 
07:39:58.680 --> 07:39:59.948 align:start position:0%
have directed us to undergo a number of
Investigations

07:39:59.948 --> 07:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
Investigations
 
07:40:01.468 --> 07:40:01.478 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's an exciting
 
07:40:02.990 --> 07:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
development with the creation of the
 
07:40:05.350 --> 07:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh but to take it
 
07:40:07.350 --> 07:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
back to this specific
 
07:40:09.670 --> 07:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
investigation I I can't tell you that
 
07:40:11.230 --> 07:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
the answer what the answer is going to
 
07:40:13.750 --> 07:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
be I do think that there are going to be
 
07:40:17.388 --> 07:40:17.398 align:start position:0%
tremendous you know uh hurdles right to
 
07:40:19.910 --> 07:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
to actually leaving the iso and cutting
 
07:40:23.788 --> 07:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
the wires so to speak but again I think
 
07:40:26.510 --> 07:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
what we'd be looking for are are those
 
07:40:28.030 --> 07:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
things potentially worth it are the
 
07:40:29.750 --> 07:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
benefits going to be uh
 
07:40:31.910 --> 07:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
outweigh the costs associated with it
 
07:40:33.388 --> 07:40:33.398 align:start position:0%
what are those other lessons we can
 
07:40:35.388 --> 07:40:35.398 align:start position:0%
learn what improvements even if they're
 
07:40:37.990 --> 07:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
incremental can we find to ensure that
 
07:40:39.230 --> 07:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire knows that we're
 
07:40:42.308 --> 07:40:42.318 align:start position:0%
going to be able to stand for our policy
 
07:40:45.350 --> 07:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
agenda uh in the in the coming decades
 
07:40:47.190 --> 07:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh because you know the the question of
 
07:40:49.110 --> 07:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
how much it's going to cost is is a very
 
07:40:50.628 --> 07:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
important question how much is it going
 
07:40:52.628 --> 07:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
to cost us to not do something is
 
07:40:54.308 --> 07:40:54.318 align:start position:0%
something we we don't necessarily know
 
07:40:55.948 --> 07:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
the answer to but this might help us
 
07:40:59.868 --> 07:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
find out followup followup it so so my
 
07:41:02.388 --> 07:41:02.398 align:start position:0%
question is you don't really have an
 
07:41:05.070 --> 07:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
overall vision of where this might lead
 
07:41:06.670 --> 07:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
which leads me to conclude this is more
 
07:41:08.350 --> 07:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
like a bluff in a in a poker hand
 
07:41:10.308 --> 07:41:10.318 align:start position:0%
they're using this as a negotiating chip
 
07:41:13.388 --> 07:41:13.398 align:start position:0%
of some sort is that correct or not uh I
 
07:41:14.830 --> 07:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't necessarily agree with that
 
07:41:17.430 --> 07:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll let Dan yeah so I think one of
 
07:41:19.948 --> 07:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
the one of the opportunities here is not
 
07:41:22.510 --> 07:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
just it's it's not just that it's a
 
07:41:25.030 --> 07:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
simple black white we we come out with a
 
07:41:26.868 --> 07:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
report with a big stamp that says yes we
 
07:41:28.830 --> 07:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
should leave we're we're looking I think
 
07:41:31.030 --> 07:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
here and with these questions we could
 
07:41:34.830 --> 07:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
see a lot of ways to improve current
 
07:41:39.150 --> 07:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
processes so not only uh is it's
 
07:41:41.070 --> 07:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
something as drastic as leaving on the
 
07:41:42.788 --> 07:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
table but what are the opportunities
 
07:41:44.510 --> 07:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
within the current system that we can
 
07:41:46.708 --> 07:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
better take advantage of and that would
 
07:41:49.150 --> 07:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
inform our Behavior going
 
07:41:53.230 --> 07:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
forward you representative Wendy Thomas
 
07:41:56.430 --> 07:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so we've heard
 
07:41:59.510 --> 07:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
from testimony that we would be looking
 
07:42:01.468 --> 07:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
at Regional transmission we'd be looking
 
07:42:03.308 --> 07:42:03.318 align:start position:0%
at Market outcomes we'd be looking at
 
07:42:06.070 --> 07:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
the control room um somebody would have
 
07:42:09.510 --> 07:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out the size and the shape of
 
07:42:12.030 --> 07:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
that you guys don't have that kind of
 
07:42:15.270 --> 07:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
background or or or uh knowledge so
 
07:42:18.070 --> 07:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
you'd obviously have to hire a ton of
 
07:42:22.510 --> 07:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants my concern and again um
 
07:42:25.150 --> 07:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note attached to this
 
07:42:28.110 --> 07:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
at all um and what is up with the
 
07:42:29.990 --> 07:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy fiscal notes are
 
07:42:32.270 --> 07:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
not provided on so many bills I mean we
 
07:42:34.230 --> 07:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
cannot go forward on this until we know
 
07:42:36.230 --> 07:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
what the price is representative I I
 
07:42:37.388 --> 07:42:37.398 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because that
 
07:42:38.628 --> 07:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
would be concerning there there is a
 
07:42:40.750 --> 07:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the bill it's been sent
 
07:42:43.628 --> 07:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
to OS I printed this off this morning I
 
07:42:46.190 --> 07:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fiscal note right
 
07:42:49.670 --> 07:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
here uh that's my fault it was handed to
 
07:42:52.190 --> 07:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
me earlier today and I forgot to pass it
 
07:42:58.110 --> 07:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:01.388 --> 07:43:01.398 align:start position:0%
now you need a followup or no I don't
 
07:43:04.350 --> 07:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:07.750 --> 07:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
followup all right representative McGee
 
07:43:10.190 --> 07:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
please uh make it brief because we have
 
07:43:12.548 --> 07:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
Miss Connors who wants to testify and we
 
07:43:14.510 --> 07:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
have to be out of here by five o'clock
 
07:43:18.230 --> 07:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I'm aware of the time um I
 
07:43:22.670 --> 07:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
I heard you say um if you were looking
 
07:43:24.388 --> 07:43:24.398 align:start position:0%
at this in terms of New Hampshire's
 
07:43:27.468 --> 07:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
policy agenda and I and I'm afraid I'm
 
07:43:29.590 --> 07:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
not sure what you mean by referring to
 
07:43:31.788 --> 07:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
that even though I work in this all the
 
07:43:34.190 --> 07:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
time because I would be concerned about
 
07:43:36.948 --> 07:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
reliability and resilience um which I
 
07:43:38.308 --> 07:43:38.318 align:start position:0%
think is a benefit of being part of the
 
07:43:40.030 --> 07:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
grid so I'm just curious what do you
 
07:43:43.750 --> 07:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean by New Hampshire's policy agenda
 
07:43:46.628 --> 07:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
and can you speak to it in terms of um
 
07:43:48.830 --> 07:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
reliability and whether that's part of
 
07:43:53.110 --> 07:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
it sure and so under RSA 374 f8 I don't
 
07:43:55.430 --> 07:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring the actual text of the
 
07:43:57.868 --> 07:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
statute but you know when you look at
 
07:43:59.868 --> 07:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
the other New England states who are
 
07:44:01.670 --> 07:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
making Investments and making policy
 
07:44:03.430 --> 07:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
decisions based on statutory
 
07:44:05.110 --> 07:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals and carbon
 
07:44:06.510 --> 07:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
emissions reduction goals or clean
 
07:44:09.070 --> 07:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
energy procurement goals those are all
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
things that are inconsistent with the
 
07:44:12.110 --> 07:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
laws of the State of New Hampshire we
 
07:44:13.670 --> 07:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't have those goals and so to the
 
07:44:16.190 --> 07:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
extent that those costs or cost of those
 
07:44:18.190 --> 07:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
policies would have to be born by New
 
07:44:20.230 --> 07:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rap payers we are instructed
 
07:44:22.830 --> 07:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
to Advocate against
 
07:44:26.350 --> 07:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
those the reliability piece
 
07:44:28.350 --> 07:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
followup well I had asked it in the
 
07:44:29.750 --> 07:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
original question
 
07:44:31.548 --> 07:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
relative to reliability so that's what
 
07:44:34.430 --> 07:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking it okay so you're all set
 
07:44:38.230 --> 07:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
then answering it sure so reliability is
 
07:44:40.830 --> 07:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
is a big piece of of the puzzle uh with
 
07:44:42.468 --> 07:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire's from the Department
 
07:44:45.070 --> 07:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
of Energy's perspective um reliability
 
07:44:47.708 --> 07:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
leaste cost electricity are the priority
 
07:44:50.270 --> 07:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the department and uh we would be
 
07:44:51.750 --> 07:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
assessing whether or not ISO New England
 
07:44:55.270 --> 07:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:57.910 --> 07:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
goals okay let's give the last word to
 
07:45:00.030 --> 07:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Molly Connor is representing the
 
07:45:03.788 --> 07:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
New England power gener ass generators
 
07:45:09.670 --> 07:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:11.430 --> 07:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
Connors thank you members of the
 
07:45:13.270 --> 07:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee I am very sensitive to how
 
07:45:15.150 --> 07:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
you're probably feeling regarding time
 
07:45:17.388 --> 07:45:17.398 align:start position:0%
right now so I will try to be concise
 
07:45:19.110 --> 07:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
and direct while also hopefully being
 
07:45:21.070 --> 07:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
helpful um for the record I'm Molly
 
07:45:22.548 --> 07:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
Connors I'm with the New England power
 
07:45:25.948 --> 07:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
generators Association um to remind you
 
07:45:28.230 --> 07:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
we represent the non-utility owned power
 
07:45:30.468 --> 07:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
plants in the region so that's about
 
07:45:33.590 --> 07:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
27,000 megaw across uh New England the
 
07:45:35.308 --> 07:45:35.318 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the power plants in New
 
07:45:37.910 --> 07:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
England are members of our organization
 
07:45:40.270 --> 07:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
um specifically to uh New Hampshire we
 
07:45:41.510 --> 07:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
have about
 
07:45:44.628 --> 07:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
4,300 megawatts of generating capacity
 
07:45:47.430 --> 07:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
um about 40% of that is carbon free or
 
07:45:50.670 --> 07:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
renewable and our Members Own um by
 
07:45:52.070 --> 07:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
owning and operating those plants they
 
07:45:55.308 --> 07:45:55.318 align:start position:0%
employ more than 750 people um paying
 
07:45:57.110 --> 07:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
countless millions in taxes across the
 
07:46:00.110 --> 07:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
state um for the bot the bottom line is
 
07:46:03.190 --> 07:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
for our members um there and we think
 
07:46:05.830 --> 07:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the entire region but specifically
 
07:46:07.868 --> 07:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here uh New Hampshire
 
07:46:09.670 --> 07:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
benefits greatly from being part of a
 
07:46:12.270 --> 07:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
regional grid that is handling the and
 
07:46:13.788 --> 07:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
that is handling the dispatch the
 
07:46:16.270 --> 07:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
planning and the financing related to
 
07:46:18.708 --> 07:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
electricity infrastructure and the Serv
 
07:46:21.868 --> 07:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
the services that come from that um for
 
07:46:23.830 --> 07:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
us there is no need for a study I can
 
07:46:25.350 --> 07:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
tell you right now that if New Hampshire
 
07:46:27.868 --> 07:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
does this study um they will learn that
 
07:46:29.990 --> 07:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
there will be a significant amount of
 
07:46:33.030 --> 07:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
work and cost from an engineering point
 
07:46:35.468 --> 07:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
of view a legal point of view and a
 
07:46:37.708 --> 07:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
financial point of view if New Hampshire
 
07:46:40.270 --> 07:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
tries to become its own system operator
 
07:46:42.150 --> 07:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
there would also be the need to expand
 
07:46:43.708 --> 07:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
significantly the role of state
 
07:46:45.708 --> 07:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
government due to increased legal
 
07:46:47.590 --> 07:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
obligations these costs would be
 
07:46:49.788 --> 07:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
extraordinary to do it on a go- it alone
 
07:46:52.510 --> 07:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
basis um because New Ham because NEPA
 
07:46:53.868 --> 07:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
represents the power plants in
 
07:46:55.910 --> 07:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
particular I will focus only on the
 
07:46:58.070 --> 07:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
market aspect of this in my testimony
 
07:47:01.070 --> 07:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
which again I not to be quick um I think
 
07:47:03.308 --> 07:47:03.318 align:start position:0%
it's important I should also say I
 
07:47:04.510 --> 07:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
understand that it can be frustrating
 
07:47:06.670 --> 07:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
for each state in a regional grid to
 
07:47:08.548 --> 07:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
have to navigate one another's um
 
07:47:10.670 --> 07:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
politics and their policies I've seen
 
07:47:12.750 --> 07:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
that firsthand because I do work across
 
07:47:15.388 --> 07:47:15.398 align:start position:0%
the region I understand that um
 
07:47:18.030 --> 07:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
diplomacy and working as a state um with
 
07:47:20.948 --> 07:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
other states is very hard it's a story
 
07:47:23.388 --> 07:47:23.398 align:start position:0%
as old as the country I think um in
 
07:47:25.150 --> 07:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
terms of The Federalist Papers and the
 
07:47:27.308 --> 07:47:27.318 align:start position:0%
Constitution um but I want to remind
 
07:47:29.590 --> 07:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
everyone that um the reason that we went
 
07:47:31.510 --> 07:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
to an independent system operator in a
 
07:47:33.510 --> 07:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
regional grid was for enhanced
 
07:47:37.070 --> 07:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
reliability and to and to um really look
 
07:47:40.230 --> 07:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
at cost overruns that were being um that
 
07:47:41.990 --> 07:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
were really out of control in terms of
 
07:47:44.150 --> 07:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
at least power generating facilities
 
07:47:45.628 --> 07:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
since the introduction of the
 
07:47:47.670 --> 07:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
independently run markets there have
 
07:47:49.750 --> 07:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
been more than 10,000 megawatts of new
 
07:47:51.910 --> 07:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
power plants built in New England
 
07:47:55.948 --> 07:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
without any rapair subsidies um and so I
 
07:47:57.708 --> 07:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
I have to emphasize that New Hampshire
 
07:47:59.708 --> 07:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
has long been avoid of markets in this
 
07:48:01.788 --> 07:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
region and strong supporters of
 
07:48:04.350 --> 07:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
competition the New Hampshire policy
 
07:48:06.468 --> 07:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
according to the energy strategy is that
 
07:48:08.070 --> 07:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
government intervention in wholesale
 
07:48:09.830 --> 07:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
markets especially with regards to
 
07:48:12.308 --> 07:48:12.318 align:start position:0%
electricity should be narrow limited and
 
07:48:15.230 --> 07:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
time limited um when you do a study that
 
07:48:16.670 --> 07:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
says we're looking to just completely
 
07:48:18.670 --> 07:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
leave the regional markets which is what
 
07:48:21.230 --> 07:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
this bill accomplishes you are sending a
 
07:48:23.308 --> 07:48:23.318 align:start position:0%
a message to people who have put
 
07:48:25.230 --> 07:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars of their private
 
07:48:27.468 --> 07:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
Capital into the into this region and
 
07:48:28.788 --> 07:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
saying even New Hampshire doesn't
 
07:48:30.788 --> 07:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
believe in markets now I'm happy to
 
07:48:33.030 --> 07:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but also want to
 
07:48:35.190 --> 07:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I know firsthand the
 
07:48:37.910 --> 07:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
frustration that the states all feel in
 
07:48:39.270 --> 07:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
having to deal with each other in a
 
07:48:42.510 --> 07:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
regional a regional construct thank
 
07:48:45.150 --> 07:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
07:48:46.830 --> 07:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:48:49.270 --> 07:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
07:48:52.110 --> 07:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
predicated on the fact that this bill is
 
07:48:54.910 --> 07:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
only asking the doe to do an
 
07:48:56.708 --> 07:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
investigation it is not a study
 
07:48:58.868 --> 07:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
committee it is not a commission or
 
07:49:00.830 --> 07:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature so my question
 
07:49:03.708 --> 07:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
would be should they do an investigation
 
07:49:06.190 --> 07:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
would you be able to participate in the
 
07:49:08.468 --> 07:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
investigation and provide them with uh
 
07:49:10.830 --> 07:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
information that they would be asking
 
07:49:12.750 --> 07:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm smiling um representative because
 
07:49:14.430 --> 07:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
the answer is of course we would but I
 
07:49:16.430 --> 07:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
also there is a quote in my family where
 
07:49:19.350 --> 07:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
we say um stress is when you say yes but
 
07:49:21.670 --> 07:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
your mind is screaming no I know that
 
07:49:24.070 --> 07:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
the question um I know that this work
 
07:49:26.468 --> 07:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
this will be a lot of work and of course
 
07:49:29.230 --> 07:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
we are totally committed to helping you
 
07:49:30.830 --> 07:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
guys navigate any questions that you
 
07:49:32.830 --> 07:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
want I would also remind the committee
 
07:49:34.350 --> 07:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
that the there have been two other
 
07:49:36.030 --> 07:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
states that have significantly
 
07:49:38.708 --> 07:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
investigated this in 2008 the state of
 
07:49:40.510 --> 07:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
Maine which at the time was very upset
 
07:49:43.030 --> 07:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
about transmission costs and cost really
 
07:49:45.590 --> 07:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
cost allocation of transmission costs
 
07:49:48.070 --> 07:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
did an extensive study um and I will say
 
07:49:49.708 --> 07:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
they were motivated to leave they wanted
 
07:49:51.868 --> 07:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
to leave and their ultimate answer was
 
07:49:53.510 --> 07:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
it is not cost effective the state of
 
07:49:55.788 --> 07:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut as recently as I want to say
 
07:49:59.110 --> 07:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
2018 um started this process they they
 
07:50:01.230 --> 07:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
claimed that they were subsidizing the
 
07:50:02.948 --> 07:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
rest of the region and they were
 
07:50:05.190 --> 07:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
committed to not doing that anymore they
 
07:50:07.350 --> 07:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
did an extensive study I remember this
 
07:50:09.110 --> 07:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
firsthand because I was working at ISO
 
07:50:10.590 --> 07:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
New England at the time and the iso
 
07:50:12.070 --> 07:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
complied with all sorts of information
 
07:50:13.948 --> 07:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
requests it's a tremendous amount of
 
07:50:16.388 --> 07:50:16.398 align:start position:0%
work and Connecticut ultimately decided
 
07:50:18.910 --> 07:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
that they were also going looking at
 
07:50:20.468 --> 07:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
taking on significant work and
 
07:50:23.350 --> 07:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
significant expense uh at no better um
 
07:50:25.670 --> 07:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
at no at no better cost for that for
 
07:50:28.110 --> 07:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
their state I think they all have been
 
07:50:30.308 --> 07:50:30.318 align:start position:0%
realizing that as frustrating as it can
 
07:50:32.030 --> 07:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
be to have to work with other states
 
07:50:33.990 --> 07:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are not always on the same page as
 
07:50:36.430 --> 07:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
one another the it's more effective to
 
07:50:37.948 --> 07:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
work within the system that we have than
 
07:50:40.788 --> 07:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
it is to walk away from it so to the
 
07:50:43.070 --> 07:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
answer yeah I'll we'll help you with
 
07:50:46.070 --> 07:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
anything representative Wendy Tomas
 
07:50:48.388 --> 07:50:48.398 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you may not know
 
07:50:49.948 --> 07:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
the answer to this but again you're the
 
07:50:53.110 --> 07:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
last speaker so you get it um who do you
 
07:50:55.430 --> 07:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
know who oversees ISO New England and
 
07:50:57.910 --> 07:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
who keeps tabs on them is are they the
 
07:51:00.430 --> 07:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
top dog or is there somebody above them
 
07:51:03.190 --> 07:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
um we all keep an eye on isoo England
 
07:51:04.868 --> 07:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
and I will um they would probably be the
 
07:51:07.030 --> 07:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
first to say that we at NEPA are one of
 
07:51:10.150 --> 07:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
their um top Watchdogs um ISO New
 
07:51:12.750 --> 07:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
England is ultimately a utility it is a
 
07:51:14.750 --> 07:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
private company that is utility it is
 
07:51:16.150 --> 07:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
07:51:18.350 --> 07:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission in accordance with
 
07:51:22.150 --> 07:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
standards set by nerk and npcc and there
 
07:51:24.308 --> 07:51:24.318 align:start position:0%
are private contracts that govern all of
 
07:51:25.788 --> 07:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
those relationships that they have with
 
07:51:28.070 --> 07:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
generators with States and with
 
07:51:30.948 --> 07:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
transmission operators and so it's it's
 
07:51:33.670 --> 07:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
not as simple as do we leave the iso um
 
07:51:35.910 --> 07:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
as Mr Cree was saying there are a lot of
 
07:51:37.788 --> 07:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
um very complicated transactions that
 
07:51:40.270 --> 07:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
have led up to this
 
07:51:44.110 --> 07:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
point thank you you need a followup uh
 
07:51:46.388 --> 07:51:46.398 align:start position:0%

07:51:49.948 --> 07:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
