00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh concerns and input that he has on the
 
00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill I had asked him to uh review it and
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
provide us with h the thoughts that he
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
had from a criminal justice
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
stand so as soon as we're able we'll
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
bring him up
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
on good morning and thank you Mr
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
welcome so just and I had a chance to
 
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
review that when I reviewed this um and
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
I will stick to just what the bill
 
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
attempts to do and not discuss the
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
underlying policy of
 
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
what the chapter itself does because
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
there's seems to be some due process
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
issues there but so my understanding is
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill intent is to expedite or
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
at least address the problem faced when
 
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
a person's
 
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
being charged with Animal Hoarding and
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
really what you need to figure out is
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
what to do with the
 
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.790 align:start position:0%
what to do with the
animals

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
during the potential
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution so what this as this
 
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or this bill has drafted what
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
I looked at
 
00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat problematic at least from
 
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
a procedural persp perspective
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
so if a person is going to be considered
 
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.870 align:start position:0%
so if a person is going to be considered
uh

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
incompetent that that person would need
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
to be the state would have to prove that
 
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
so that is something that they would
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
have to prove um they bear the burden by
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence that the
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
person's not competent St and that's a
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional right that any defendant
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
would have but in part of being deemed
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
in incompetent they have to show that
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
you cannot be uh your mental health
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue cannot be treated or
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
cured within a 12 month time period now
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
when I say mental health issue the it's
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
not a medical term it's a legal term you
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
know you can still have a mental health
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
issue but be competent to stand trials
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
so when it says cured it means you are
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
now competent to stand trial so that
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
requires a a in-depth evidentiary
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
hearing so this if that's the case the
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
and a person does submit to a mental
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
health evaluation even if they are
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
deemed to be incompetent but they can be
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated within let's say six
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
months it actually could delay the
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
process because the trial will will
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
essentially be the prosecution would
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
essentially be stayed and while that
 
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 align:start position:0%
person's receiving mental health
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
treatment so it actually could end up
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
slowing down the process if if which
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
would can be counterproductive to what
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish here I also
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
looked at the language where it said
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
they would undergo a psychological or
 
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.110 align:start position:0%
they would undergo a psychological or
psychiatric

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation I would would at least
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
reference RSA
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
135c and that section itself has to do
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
with involuntary someone who's
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
involuntarily confined because of a
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
mental health issue whether they're
 
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
going to harm
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
themselves or or another and the re what
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
I would reference in that section is
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
when a person is confined the court
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
orders that person to submit to a mental
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
health evaluation that's performed by a
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and then that report from
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
is a report prepared by the psychiatrist
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's given to the judge to help
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate uh the the individual's mental
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
health status to make a determination of
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
now that determination in that scenario
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
would be to find the person but I think
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
in this case you have a a psychiatrist
 
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
would essentially be it would be a
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
recent mental health evaluation that
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise qualifies expert testim so it
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
would be at least in my opinion it puts
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
the court in the best position to make a
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
determination so you don't want to
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
135c procedure because that would
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
involve obviously the inv voluntary
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
confinement and that's a whole another
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh that wouldn't be applicable but I
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
think having that that standard where
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
the the court relies on a support for by
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist I I think you want to make
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
it consistent and have a psychiat
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist do it because they have
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
obviously uh education and and
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
Performing these type of mental health
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
evaluations in in their their doctors so
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
I mean that's what that puts the judge
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
in the best position I just I'm looking
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
at how this could be done the concern I
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
have is while all this is being done
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's it is a if it's a criminal case if
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
the person's found not guilty
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure what happens to the
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
animals I I I I look at that as it needs
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
there was a charge there was an
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
order issued and I'm not sure where the
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
order would come from because in a think
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
of a domestic violence case where you
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
have the underlying criminal case
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
relating to the domestic violence charge
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
it could be a civil restraining order
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's separate it's a separate burden of
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
proof it's a separate hearing even
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
though that there's some
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
overlay um with the facts here there I'm
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
not recommending you have a separate
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
type of like restraining
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
order parallel that to domes of
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
violence but you're deprive someone's
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
being deprived of their property but and
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
you're having them go through this
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
mental health evaluation but I'm looking
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
at it while while that's
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
happening I'm not sure that
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
that's I I guess I my question is what
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
is the mental health evaluation trying
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
to solve here the Animal Hoarding is the
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
it might slow the case down but at the
 
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.630 align:start position:0%
it might slow the case down but at the
same

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
time is the person going to get their
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
property back when the when it's all
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
sent done if they're found not guilty so
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this bill as written
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
accomplishes its goal if the
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
person and H the other thing it's it can
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
be expensive to get a mental health
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
evaluation my understand is to have a an
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation by a doctor which would cost
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
if they're uninsured around $1,500 to
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
,000 when it's ordered by the court then
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's being there are psychiatrists that
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
can be I know it's under 135c there
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists that are appointed by the
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
court to uh conduct these evaluations
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
but again there's a cost to go with that
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
as well but I don't I guess I don't
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
understand what the evaluation is doing
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.430 align:start position:0%
other than
it's

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
really taking the their title way to a
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
property but suppose if they're deemed
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
incompetent then they're not going to
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
have the trial anyway but they're losing
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
some of their property but not all
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're losing their animals I just see
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's really it's it's a difficult
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
subject but I I don't see I see it as
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
such a clash between different areas of
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
laws and different that I don't I don't
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
know if this is going to accomplish the
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
goal and it actually might require to be
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
longer I don't know if that makes any
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
sense that was my evaluation of it and
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
then the underlying uh bill uh chapter
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
itself had some concerns in it in of
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
itself because again you can be deprived
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
of your property without probable
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
cause I want we don't we don't have to
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
go completely down that road but the
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment says probable caused
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
right in there so if you're deprived of
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
your property with the lower
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
standard I'm not sure that is
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate especially if you might not
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
get your property
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
back well now you understand some of the
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
questions we were wrestling with as a
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is part of the reason we
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to retain this get some input
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
from Criminal Justice I appreciate that
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
are you uh are you okay if I open it up
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
to questions from the committee for you
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
yes and and just for the the committee
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
members to understand and I hope hope
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
this representative forgives me for
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
throwing his name out there but the case
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire that discusses
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
incompetency uh involving a criminal
 
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.629 align:start position:0%
incompetency uh involving a criminal
case

00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh it came out in 2018
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
at that time representative Lynn was
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
sitting on the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
Court so he would presumbly I presume he
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be very knowledgeable of that case
 
00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:10.839 align:start position:0%
at least more than I am as he actually
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh he decided that case he's one of the
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
judges that concurred in the opinion
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you is there any uh questions
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee know that you certainly
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
inspired me to look at things and read a
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
bit differently and uh we may be leaning
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
on you again because you gave me a lot
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
to chew on in area of Statute that I'm
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
not necessarily familiar with so I'll
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
have to go back and do a little more
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
reading if I could this reference if you
 
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
reading if I could this reference if you
go

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
to uh line 28 where it says a person to
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
undergo a psychological or psychiatric
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation I would at least change that
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
a mental health
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation you know as described and
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
then I I can tell you the RSA
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is on point where involves the
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation by a psychiatrist so that's
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
135 C uh colon
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
40 is and again that's the involving inv
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary confinement you can somewhat
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
mirror that
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
language and where
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
it's discusses a report and then it
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
discusses what information you want in
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
that report specifically to be evaluated
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
by the um psychiatrist and then the
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
judge is not bound by what that report
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
says so it's it's really just a
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation obviously has some
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
influence the problem that creates is
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
that if it's adverse to a party not
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
people may want to challenge and that's
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
when they can get really expensive and
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
again we're while this is all happening
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
if they're gonna if it's challenged
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
there going to be hearings with multiple
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
Witnesses expert Witnesses clashing with
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
each other and meanwhile the animals are
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
kind of in going to be in limbo even
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
longer so I how long this process would
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
take to play
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
out to find an expert to just as a
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
lawyer when I've had to retain expert
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
Witnesses you you shop around you get to
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
execute a contract go over with your
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
your client make sure you get you want
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
to talk them make sure they're qualified
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
especially if this was me you know I'm
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
not I'm not me familiar with I'm not a
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
doctor so talking with an expert witness
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to take some time for myself
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
to get comfort with that person so that
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
can even take some time so I see this
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
hearing being two three months at a
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
minimum and then there's the issue
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
whether that person is an expert or not
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
but I I feel like if they're a
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist it shouldn't be a problem
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
but thank you looks like we have a
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
question from rep
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I just wanted to clarify in
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
terms of uh what the what the charge
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
would the potential charge would be um
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty um as a in terms of um
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
negligence uh and so the Animal Hoarding
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
would not be a charge um uh but I I
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't that's in some sense a picky point
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
but the idea behind the bill is if there
 
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
but the idea behind the bill is if there
is

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
um if if someone if if the evidence on
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
the ground says that this person is is
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
um treating their animals negligently to
 
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
a degree that um it right it it it would
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
be considered cruelty then something
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
needs to be done about it and um and
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
then the question is uh is the
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
underlying cause of the
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
negligence uh a a willful act or is it a
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh or is it um the result of some sort
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
of mental
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
incompetence and uh what the bill is
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do is create a um a mechanism
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that the animals will be uh will end
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
up being treated
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately and but someone who is um
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
who is inapo treating their animals
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
inappro inappropriately because of uh a
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
mental health condition wouldn't
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know be should be uh
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
placed into the category of being a
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
criminal uh and uh and I know that this
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
is a um this is kind of what we're
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
struggling with because if they are not
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
considered a criminal then the taking
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
um then requiring them to get rid of
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
their animals becomes very tricky um the
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
legal basis for saying they shouldn't
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
have the animals is hard to make but at
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
the same time you don't want to give
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
someone a criminal record if they're
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
doing it because they AR aren't
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
competent so that's kind of what we're
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
struggling with and I don't know if you
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
have any um that that clarifies the
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
question so you could have give us some
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
more suggestions or if uh we're still
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
kind of stuck
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
muddling and thank you for the for the
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
question what what I was struggling with
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
myself is that so in order for the
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
animals to
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
be whether they're seat listen anytime
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
any type of property whether it's your
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
cell phone your
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
sunglasses your your jacket is taken
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
from you by the state by a government
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
actor it's a considered a seizure under
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
the Fourth Amendment now I understand in
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
a scenario like this there's somewhat of
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
a clear and inent danger to animals so
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
an officer feels it's necessary to act
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
especially in a situation where it says
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have time to get a court
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
order to act
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
so that I don't find anything egregious
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
about that policy but it doesn't it's
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't say probable cause under the
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment and then it goes on to
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
say even longer that if they can after
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
seven days they might not even file
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
charges so if it was such an urgency
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
once they take the animals into custody
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
or into that they should be trying to
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
file some type of charge or some type of
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
because they need an order at some point
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
they basically take your property and
 
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.350 align:start position:0%
they basically take your property and
then

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't come claim it you lose it
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering what order does it say
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
that that they're allowed to maintain or
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
keep your property there is no court
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
order and there's no probable cause
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
standard stated in that in this section
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
what I was kind of throwing out there
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
was if you don't if the person's not
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
going to be charged
 
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
criminally in order to be deemed
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial you wouldn't
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
deem someone incompetent to stand trial
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
unless they were being charged with a
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
criminal offense
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
even though I I understand logically it
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
might sound like a good idea well the
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
person's incompetent let's save
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves the trouble of uh going
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
through the you know the criminal
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
procedure here but if the person's not
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
being charged with anything there's no
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
need or Reason to ever deem a person
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial so you kind
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
of have to be charged with something and
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
then if you're going to compel someone
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
to a mental health
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation if that's the circumstance it
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be by an order of the
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
court so for a court to issue an order
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
there has to be some open case attached
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know most court orders actually say
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
most every cour order I've ever seen
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
will have the docket number whether it's
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
a civil restraining order you know or
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's if it's a civil case you
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
know just simple personal injury case if
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's a court order dog number would be
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
on there if it's a criminal case same
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
same thing it will have court docket
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
number so if there's nothing pending in
 
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
number so if there's nothing pending in
a

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
court when you get a warrant that's
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's usually prior to there being any
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
criminal case but you have to again in
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
order to get a warrant and this actually
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
is something that came out uh not this
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
was literally I want to say in the last
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
week the Supreme Court United States
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
said that in order to seize Pro property
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
you need to have a warrant inside seize
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
it from inside the person to search
 
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
it from inside the person to search
their

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
home you can't just simply do take go
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
inside some seize their property and do
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
that do it that way so it to me you need
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you do it with the warrant side
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine because you have you've
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
established under the law that probable
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
cause with going through a judge but
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
when you seize the property what are you
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
going to do with it are you going to
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
just keep
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
it you're getting the warrant because
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's some type of criminal activity
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
that you're alleged that police are
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
claim if there if they're not going to
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
prosecute the case they shouldn't be
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really make sense or for a
 
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
police officer to get a warrant because
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting it on the basis
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
of criminal activity you could go the
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
route of getting a civil order I guess
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
think of like a restraining order in a
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case but here it's a
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
lower burden of proof it's a civil in
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
nature in that case you can have a
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence restraining order and
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
there never be an underlying criminal
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
case so that that that is something that
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
is is could happen and that to me
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind the only way I see this
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
being done if you don't want to
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
prosecute the person
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
but I guess setting up this whole
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
chapter this whole system I I don't know
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a problem that happens
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
wondering I don't see any other way of
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
doing it you need to have a court case
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of where I'm my
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
thought all right thank thank you rep
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
question you know I do have some
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
questions but I think I'll save them
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
pronoun sorry I saw your hand yes all
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
stable thank you U Mr chair and thank
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh directing
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
to representative Abus um it's it seems
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
like if we're concerned about the anim
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
animal as a
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
primary going down this Rabbit Hole of
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
um psychological evaluation and testing
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
and proof and warrant given the delays
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
that you have cited um don't we really
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we really be going in the
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
other direction of existing laws
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and statutes I mean we've
 
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
all seen incidents on the TV where
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
people have hoarded uh you know dozen or
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
more animals can't take care of them and
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
then uh Department comes in and um gets
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
a warrant removes the animals and
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
there's court case um on that subject
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
from other statutes so and and that's
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
the question don't we have adequate
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
statutes already to address the lack of
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
care to the animals uh and then deal
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
with the individual um in some other
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
fashion beyond
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
that it it's already animal cruelty is
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
already a crime and if there is a crime
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
being committed and there's prob cause
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
to believe that a crime is being
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
committed it's I guess in in with animal
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty it it could be a situation where
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's a crime in progress so if a police
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
officer has probable cause to arrest the
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
person they can arrest the person even
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
without the
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
warrant if they the warrant is to is one
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
way to go about it but when it comes to
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
seizing the property
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
I mean even if someone's arrested for an
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated offense to with the animals I
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
mean if you're going to arrest someone
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be you know they're
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to be held without bail for
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
example I mean you're going to have a
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of animals in the house that
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't AR attended to whether
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're farm animals or whatnot so I I
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
think the law does already address this
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't the problem is is that while
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
this case is going on and would this
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
would have been even Amplified during
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
the covid-19
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic the trial is ongoing what's
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the animals and
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
this there's evidentiary reasons that
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
you need to if you're going to claim
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
negligence you
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
gotta you're gonna have to gather some
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
evidence in that route so I think going
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
getting a warrant and and doing the the
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
police investigation as they would
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
investigate any other offense I don't
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
see why you would deviate from that
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
because I think and I I get why we we
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
this we're trying to help as I'm going
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
animal everyone knows that and I'm open
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
about that but I'm just saying if you
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
create a carball on the law for these
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
for animals or this type of you know
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
which our property it gets a little
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
dicey on how you want yes I get protect
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
the animals but what do we need a case
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
or an order or something in place in
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
order to do that otherwise I I see a
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
Pa thank you for that followup yes go
 
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
Pa thank you for that followup yes go
ahead

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
um yeah again um if if the primary focus
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
is is on the animals Animal Care uh
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
safety um the psychological aspect of
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
owner um Becomes of secondary importance
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
because time is of the essence when
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's abuse and you have to remedy it
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
stop it um and it seems like we've seen
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
cases where uh the state has come in and
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
and done ample work in to safety uh um
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
and and remedy of animal situations the
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
the um do you think that the um the bill
 
00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:14.389 align:start position:0%
the um do you think that the um the bill
of

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
366 uh the definition of hoarding was
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
was adequate I I don't personally think
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
it was adequate didn't even give us a
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
number what constitutes hoarding um you
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
know people who can't take care of
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
themselves might be hoarding at one or
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
two animals people with some means might
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh be considered hoarding at uh half a
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
dozen you know what I mean it's too
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
variable and flexible U and do you think
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
that um definition of the bill um was
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
inadequate or could should be
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
amended so I didn't look into the
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
definition it of boing it it referenc
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic and statistical manual of
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
mental disorders it's it's not uncommon
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
when for a a law or a statute to to
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
reference a definition of that the
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
problem is they could change their
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
definition any time they would then be
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
changing your the
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
law while they if the look at this way
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
analogy we joke about this with my
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
someone names the planets Pluto they
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
Chang the definition of what a planet is
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
so what was a planet no longer was one
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
same thing and just're saying if they
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
changeed the if the diagnostic and
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
statistical manual mental disorder
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
changes the definition of Animal
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
Hoarding then so would the crime itself
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
would change so that that's the problem
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
with referencing that I I don't know how
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
they reference it and I would say you're
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
right some people can have 12 cats and
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
that be considered hoarding and some
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
some may not but as long as the animals
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
are being properly cared for I don't see
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
problem here my problem was how the
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
animals were being seized is that it
 
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.389 align:start position:0%
animals were being seized is that it
didn't

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily require a probable cause to
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
se so CH chairman ambus I'll step in
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
here a sec part of the reason we chose
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
that definition was upon the
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a an expert person
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
that we had testifying that came in and
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
U and there was a good definition
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
contained within there she's actually on
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
Q to speak right after you so perhaps
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
we'll defer that conversation if you're
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay with that rep staple until e Daisy
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
is speaking and you can ask her that
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
question as well and what I would
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
recommend just is rather than reference
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic and statistical Manual of
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
the mental disorders is you you can take
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
what the definition is now and put that
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the RSA as opposed to just
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
referencing the manual because I'm just
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
saying if the manual changes its
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
definition ever so slightly essentially
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
our law our definition is also changing
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
without there being a legislative
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
process because sometimes you it may
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
change for whatever reason it just
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's just more of a matter of practice
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
than sure so I'm not sure it would be as
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
much of a problem in this case but just
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's the way I would do it trth thank
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
you uh rep Highland I see you're back
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
with your hand up you want to ask a
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
question now thank thank you uh thank
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yeah I I
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
guess it might be appropriate to put
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
this out there now I just it's my
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the psych
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
eval would decide whether
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
um this would be criminal or mental you
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
know whether whether there would be
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
criminal charges or not but also when
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
you talked about before uh that they
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
had 12 months
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
to to become cured talked about that
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
term um it's my understanding that the
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
the point of of that would be to prevent
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
recidivism and that if this person could
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
be cured within that 12 months or
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
whatever the time frame might end up
 
00:29:57.799 --> 00:29:58.549 align:start position:0%
whatever the time frame might end up
being

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
if they can prove that they are able to
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
manage the animals within that space to
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
to become well or whatever where where
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
the parameters are um that they would be
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
able to get their animals back and then
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
not have legal repercussions but I might
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
be a misunderstanding and it might not
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
be appropriate time to bring that up but
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to put it out there thank
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
you so a criminal defendant has a
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to not be tried if
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
they are legally
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
comp and that's already the law so in
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
this case if the person you're saying
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
that if a person's deemed incompetent
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
this is what would happen but that's
 
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.389 align:start position:0%
this is what would happen but that's
means

00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's competency to stand trial is a
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
legal not a medical concept
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
so you can
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
be that's what that's what I'm trying to
 
00:30:54.629 --> 00:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
say it's a legal standard not a medical
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
standard so that's why the court is not
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
NE necessarily Bound by what the
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or whoever performed the
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
mental health mental health evaluation
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
recommended it certainly carries some
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
weight the state has the burden of proof
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate the person um it is
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
competent to stand trial by a propond of
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
the evidence
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
so if in such a case where it there's an
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
evidential hearing must follow and the
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
defendant is entitled to present
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
evidence and cross examine any Witnesses
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the trial court M has to make a
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
specific finding U of fact and on the
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
record must identify the evidence in
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
which it based its decision
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
on and to and the reason why is that if
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
a person wants to appeal that decision
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a clear record whe of
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
whether that person is competent or not
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
now the 12mon time period is so when
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
they're determining if if if a person is
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
incompetent in part whatever conditions
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
that person has that that they're
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
relying on to find that person in
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
Conflict the court is making the
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
determination that that those conditions
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
will not be cured or improved upon
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
within a 12-month time period so that's
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
you can you may be temporarily
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
incompetent but from a legal concept you
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have to have something that is not
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to reasonably be cured
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
or at least when I say cure to the point
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
that you are now confident to stand
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
trial within a 12- month time period
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's what the court is making a
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
determination it's
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
so it the it's the Supreme Court in New
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically did not they
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
actually said they they do not want the
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist of the mental health
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation report to be what controls
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
the finding because that is the role of
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
the Court not not the mental health
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate now again that holds a lot of
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
weight it is essentially for all intents
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
and purposes expert testimony or expert
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
evidence prepared by an expert but it's
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
just it's not per se this is the
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation there they're finding
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
quote thank you thank you uh rep
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
Bix yes um so I was
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I I was wondering in terms of uh the
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
definition and sort of citing uh the
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
definition uh for the d u the DSM for
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
the definition I was wondering if
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's any other place in law where the
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
DSM is cited for the definition or some
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
other third body uh that would be
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
creating a definition and I I think the
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
one the example that comes to mind would
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
be in terms of uh say um material
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
standards for building or that sort of
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
thing where there might be engineering
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
definition from an engineering or
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
organization and I'm wondering if
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
anything like that is put in statute or
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the reference uh rather than
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
having the text from that reference put
 
00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:15.149 align:start position:0%
having the text from that reference put
into

00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute and thank you for your question
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
well I couldn't tell you how many times
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
it's happened but it happens all the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
time where I my opinion is when because
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a Criminal charge is
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
that you want to have a clear definition
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
written in the RSA and if you don't want
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
to even though you're re you're
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
essentially adopting a I would say a
 
00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:42.190 align:start position:0%
essentially adopting a I would say a
reliable

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
definition and I'm not saying there's
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with the definition
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
provided I'm just saying that by if that
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
definition were to change by the third
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
party organization so would your
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
criminal uh definition of what what the
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
offense is so that's where my concern is
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
it comes to building
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
codes yes that happens all the time but
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're also dealing with civil type of
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
cases I'm just saying with a criminal
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
case it is important that a person's on
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
notice of what the charges
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
are and what is and is not know
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
ignorance and laws on defense but if the
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
definition is changing and it
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
happens it's little harder for someone
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
to follow than if it's whether it's done
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
by an act of legislation
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
I just would say for any type of
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
criminal case I would recommend in my my
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
opinion if you want to reference a
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
definition from a third party
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
organization rather than reference the
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
organization is that I would just
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
essentially cut and taste their
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
definition into the RSA and if they make
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
a change and and this body you know
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
supports that change it's worth doing it
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
but I would only say that for criminal
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
cases I wouldn't I think for building
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
codes uh you know
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
some uh Health codes that wouldn't
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily be as reasonable some of the
 
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.190 align:start position:0%
necessarily be as reasonable some of the
Civil

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
Civil
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
matters thank you uh representative Von
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
kinsky yes thank you Mr chair um so I'm
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to start this by saying I'm not
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not equating children and animals
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
here um but it seems like what we're
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do is determine if someone is
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
incompetent to care for
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
animals not you know whether that's
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
criminal or or not but is this similar
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
to when we try to determine if someone
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
is competent to care for children uh you
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
can be incompetent to care for a child
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
but it it could have nothing to do with
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
criminality it could be just you know
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
unable to physically lift a child or
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it is is
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
there again I'm not trying to equate
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
animals and children but is the process
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
similar enough to where we can lean on
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
what we do in in the case of children to
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
help guide us with what we're doing um
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question so when
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
it comes to Children you're dealing with
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
approprate and family court type of
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
issues and then there's although you
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
have constitutional interests in your
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
property it is a different
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional evaluation when it comes
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
to children so but I
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
read uh HB 366 the incompetency is
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
whether the person is confident stand
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
trial so you can
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
be you could be found I guess
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
incompetent um to care for your children
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
but still be competent to stand
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
trial so I don't think um those
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
other so I think here when you're
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
finding the person's in if the person's
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
in C to and trial they're in the stand
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
trial you don't need to codify that in
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
any any
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
RSA what this is doing is so if a person
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
is considered incompetent and trial what
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you do with the
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
animals the person's not being convicted
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
but you're essentially it would divest
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
the person of the title to their
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
property permanently and it would pass
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
on to family members or it says where
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
where that property would go but we're
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
essentially taking someone's property
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
from them and even let's say I was
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
deemed um incompetent to stand trial
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm and you took my my cats and gave
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
them to my brother now that person to
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
person that sounds very reasonable but I
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
own those animals I now they've been
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
taken from me and the legal interest in
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
those have been given to someone
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
else now I understand from an animal
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
cruelty from an animal cruelty point of
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
view I am 100% on board with that but
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
from a constitutional due process
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
perspective I've now lost my title to my
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
concern and it just begs the question
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
how which direction do we want to
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
go I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
someone challenged that all the way up
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court and that that just
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
because someone will challenge a lot of
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court does not mean that you
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
should comes up a lot at least in the
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Public Safety community
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
that it that does shouldn't mean you
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pass effect how you're going
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
to vote on this someone's just going to
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
challenge it I know um if you if you're
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with a large amount of animals
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
there's also a value side of it
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
especially if you're involved in
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
breeding animals so I I can see this
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
that being a
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
problem that even though the person
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
isn't is at the time they're incompetent
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
stand trial and just because you're
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
incompetent stand trial doesn't mean you
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily confident to care for an
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
anim again that they're somewhat
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from each other so
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to bring in thank you I'm
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to bring in um Eileen Daisy and
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
Stacy obber into the conversation here
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
because we're sort of getting into an
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
area where I think they have some some
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
valuable input that they could add so uh
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
Stacy did you want to come in and make a
 
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.829 align:start position:0%
Stacy did you want to come in and make a
comment

00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman I really
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh your all of the
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee's time and attention to to
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
this and uh this has been very
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
informative to hear chair abbis uh with
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
his legal experience I wanted to just
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank rep Von plinsky for raising the
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
question about an evaluation as to
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not an individual is capable
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
of caring for an animal um and share
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
with you a I had a lengthy conversation
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
with a supervising judge at a mental
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
health court in Maryland who has drafted
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
manual for judges uh who are presiding
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
over an Animal Hoarding disorder case um
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 90 pages in length it's not
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
officially published but she's shared it
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
with me as well and I'm uh been
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
authorized to share it with you know any
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
lawmaker if it's of assistance but in a
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
case that she was uh presiding over that
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
individual was determined to be so
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
delusional that he was incompetent to
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
stand trial and other sections of the
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire animal cruelty statute I
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
do believe there's uh procedural
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
language around the temporary custody of
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
animals pending animal cruelty charges
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
um but there may be individuals where
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
charges have been brought and post
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
evaluation they are deemed competent to
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
stand trial but may be um incompetent at
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
caring for themselves or animals and uh
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think the real intent at least from
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
the American Catt Club standpoint was
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
to recognize that Animal Hoarding
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
disorder is not widely understood or
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
known and that there are on occasion
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who are repeatedly
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
without access to mental health
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
treatment uh the literature suggests
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
that there is a 100% recidivism rate and
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh there was one case for instance that
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
I saw where a gentleman had been
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and 10 years later was being
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
prosecuted again because these are
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who are compulsively
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
collecting animals and if we don't
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
address the root cause of their behavior
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
we leave them and animals in this
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
Perpetual cycle of uh gross neglect so
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me just share those
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
few Thoughts with regard to the purpose
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
really of the of the
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh eileene would
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
conversation yes I would uh thank you Mr
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you everyone for
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
for your wonderful feedback especially a
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative abis this has been highly
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
informative um some of the language that
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
we myself um and Stacy obber um we took
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
a look at this and we created a new
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
draft where we inserted instead of the
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
word or term Animal Hoarding hazardous
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
animal accumulation and the reason for
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is that uh psychological or mental
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
health valuation would determine if a
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
mental health issue actually exists and
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
to specify what type or types are
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
actually present instead of just jumping
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
to the conclusion that it's animal
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
horing just based off a quantity of of
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
animals that are in
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
question um and so I did want to just
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
reshare what that definition is because
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
I did hear the question earlier as to
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
how Animal Hoarding is actually defined
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the dsm5 which was published in 2013
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
and so Animal Hoarding does fall under
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
hoarding disorder just to clarify that
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's as follows it's a failure to
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
provide minimal standards of Sanitation
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
space nutrition and veterinary care for
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
the animals there's also a presence of
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the inability to recognize the adverse
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
effects on the welfare of the animals
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
the resident or residents residing in
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
the home and the home
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
environment this is coupled with the
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
presence of obsessive attempts to
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
accumulate or maintain a collection of
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
animals despite the deteriorating
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
conditions of the animals and the
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
environment and the lastly the person
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
presents with perhaps a denial or
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
minimization of evident problems
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
regarding the living conditions for the
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
person and the animals
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to go back to making
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
that distinction between hazardous
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
animal accumulation versus Animal
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hoarding is because we can also make
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
sure that through a psychological
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation is there perhaps a cognitive
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
impairment some sort of a physical death
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
deficit or is this accumulation of
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
animals related to some sort of
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation such as over
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
breeding and not related to a mental
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
health issue whatsoever of course the
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
forensic Mental Health Report would then
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
serve as expert testimony which would
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
provide the judge with um adequate um
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
next steps determining how the the
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
defendant and what the what the outcome
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
should be of the case um but again the
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of this is to really
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
explore whether or not there's a mental
 
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.549 align:start position:0%
explore whether or not there's a mental
health

00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
concern here um and what should happen
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
next whether it's treatment or not I did
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
hear a question earlier from
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton um regarding
 
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:05.559 align:start position:0%
the quantity or number of animals should
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
that be specified and in fact it
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um there is a huge um ex
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually a large resource of literature
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
related to Animal Hoarding and other
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
states have taken a look at this as well
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
that it can be incredibly problematic
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
specifying a number because let's say
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
for instance animal is defined as a
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
person not having the ability to care
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
properly for say 50 animals um but then
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
what happens when there's 49 it starts
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
to get rather subjective and and muddy
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
um and it really is the focus should be
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
around the quality of care not the
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
care so I thank you all for your time I
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to step in and share some of
 
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
just wanted to step in and share some of
my

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts right that down so bear with me
 
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.710 align:start position:0%
thoughts right that down so bear with me
a

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
second is there uh any
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
questions the committee or or for E
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
Stacy or
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
or yes go ahead Jud yes so I'm wondering
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
would you are are you planning on
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
sharing that um those definitions and
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
the language of of the um I guess you
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
had a new draft of language that you
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to include in this statute for
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
this proposed
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and can you forward that
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
along to
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
us yes most certainly Stacy and I will
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
will do that okay great thank you for
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
your work on that it sounds really
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
really an
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
improvement rep Avis did you have a
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman it's more
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
a kind of an open-ending question for
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
everybody including the other two um
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
Witnesses is just
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
testified I I certainly appreciate that
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
if someone has a mental health uh issue
 
00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:05.430 align:start position:0%
if someone has a mental health uh issue
that

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
is basically they committing what we
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
Define criminal act as a that's actually
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
fueled by the mental health condition
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
they can't control the ACT uh in that
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
case it we really don't want that person
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
prosecuted because it's that's not
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
really we're not we're yes we're helping
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
the animals but not solving down problem
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
if this was a civil restraining order
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
type of situation I say that because
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
that's if it was a civil order that's
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
filed and part of that order you can
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
have a mental health evaluation that can
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
all be done without there being a
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
criminal offense and you that's really
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's up to I I would defer to this
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee on whether they want to do
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
that I think that would one put the
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
person in a position where they can
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually get or receive some type of
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
mental Health evaluation also they're
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
not going to be charged with a criminal
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
offense it's charges have to be filed
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
have to be brought but it also gives
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
that there some type of venue for there
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
to be some type of court order to least
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
justify everything that's that's
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
occurring but that keep in
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
mind the trick that you run into with
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
that and this is what the Supreme Court
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
case was about came out last week
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
but you need a warrant to get a warrant
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
that it the warrant is involved in a
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
criminal case not a civil case so that
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
puts the enforcement in somewhat of a
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
tight spot because now they can't they
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
can't seize the property without getting
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
a warrant but there's no criminal case
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
the way they get a warrant sometimes is
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they're saying you're violating the
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
Civil order but then by violating the
 
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.309 align:start position:0%
Civil order but then by violating the
Civil

00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
Civil
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
order you now have a criminal case
 
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.030 align:start position:0%
order you now have a criminal case
anyway

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
so I know that's
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
I I understand what everyone's trying to
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
do but it it's kind of goes around it
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
and what we really want to hold for is
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
for there to be appropriate discretion
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
when which cases are prosecute which
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
ones are not but even that can be um
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
subject to scrutiny so just ask a quick
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
question and then I'm gonna throw it
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
over to rep Dix So based on what you
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
just said representative abis if we if
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
this was to go as a civil order would
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
that would that still allow for the
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
seizure of the animals is where your
 
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:28.990 align:start position:0%
seizure of the animals is where your
concern

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.670 align:start position:0%
concern
is

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
well if there was a civil order in place
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would allow seizure of the animals
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
and there would have to be a burden in
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
elements that get said
 
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
order that would allow the animals to be
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
obviously put in a position where
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
they're no longer In Harm's Way it that
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
would also create a venue where the
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
person could get mental health be
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
ordered to submit to a mental health
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation and although their conduct
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
may be fall under a criminal statute
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
that person is not being charged with
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
any criminal offense I said earlier you
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
can have a domestic violence restraining
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
order without a criminal case to go
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
along with it it does it's very common
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
that that they run together but they
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to and it's it happens more
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
often than not that than where there is
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
no criminal P so I think if you went
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
that route that gives you the
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually address some of
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
the concerns about not charging someone
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
because of really because a unfortunate
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
byproduct of their mental health issue
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
but I guess if the person doesn't comply
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the order and doesn't want to
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
surrender the animals because you can't
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
get a warrant now well I say you can't
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
it it's you not you don't have a search
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
warrant or a warrant to seize the
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
property you have a court order when you
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
enforce the order if they don't comply
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
with the order well that in and of
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
itself would be a criminal act you
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
without there being a penalty for
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
violating the order
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
the order is uh just a piece of paper
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
but then now you're dealing with someone
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
who now has they're getting arrest for
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
something else it's it's kind of
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
circular so you gotta kind of Juggle
 
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.190 align:start position:0%
circular so you gotta kind of Juggle
that

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
in sure thank you uh
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
repic yeah this is actually kind of a
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
question for uh you rep Pearl as the
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um so there there is the
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill as it exists
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
now seems to create create confusion
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
between incompetence to stand trial and
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
incompetence to care for animals and I
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
was wondering what uh whether your your
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
focus your main focus in in putting
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
together the bill was the idea of the
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
incompetence to care for the animals or
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
trial I think it's more incompetence to
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
care for animals and uh it gets into
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
such a challenge ing area because again
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an area that um the
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
criminal justice side of it is certainly
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
not a strong Focus for me
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
and we certain I certainly worked with
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh with with Stacy and Elaine and a few
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
others in drafting this originally and I
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
I think my focus was more about care of
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
the animals and trying not to have these
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
folks prosecuted if you know and for
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
something that if we could avoid that if
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
possible and and find a pathway to get
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
these animals cared for properly I I
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
think I'm gonna actually pitch it over
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
to Stacy for a minute and let her weigh
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman um I I agree
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
I think this was uh you know the initial
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill was to ensure that
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
the court had an awareness that this
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder existed and that
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
in fact it may be the root cause for the
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
gross NE neglect of animals of a
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
defendant brought before them um so I I
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you it may be in the rare
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
case that someone's disorder is so
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
significant uh as the Maryland judge
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
shared with me that they would be
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
determined uh delusional and incompetent
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
to even stand trial uh what I'd like to
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
understand from chair abis is whether or
 
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
not in terms of the Civil order approach
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh because agreed we'd like to avoid
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
criminal charges and instead try to
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
create a policy where we could use
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
carrots and sticks to have the
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
individual um get mental health
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
treatment um is there a difference
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
between a
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
warrant a Court warrant to seize in a
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
criminal case versus an administrative
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
warrant and uh for civil orders our
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
administr would an administrative
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
warrant allow the temporary custody of
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
animals so that they could be cared for
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
while the court was having the
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
individual evaluated and perhaps
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
deciding what criteria um this
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
individual would need to meet in order
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
instance and thank you for your question
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
and when I answer this this this case
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
was L literally came out recently so
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
there may be difference of opinions on
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
it this this was L I want to say last
 
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
last seven days the Supreme Court came
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
out with this and in that case the
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
police searched a person's house they
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
had a civil order it was out of Rhode
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
Island it was uh it was a red flag order
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
and in those in Rhode Island my
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is only police officers
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
can file for those
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
orders and what happened is
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
they took the person they took the the
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
defendant or the respondent into custody
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
he wasn't there and they but they the
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
police told the person's wife that it
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
was he gave consent so to search the
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
house and then they searched the house
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
and seized property inside the house
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
even though the order says that a person
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
may have to surrender that property the
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
search warrant is different the search
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
warrant they can go
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
in they can go they have they have the
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
right to go go into the house and take
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
said property you know whether they're
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary or not that's they they
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
can knock on the door say we're coming
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
in to take to search for this that's it
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you resist they can the police can
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
keep carrying on with an order a civil
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
order they can't really they can't
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
really do
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
that it's it's
 
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
more hope for cooperation type of thing
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
but if you don't comply with the order
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
that is in and of itself a
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
crime now the crime is you're not
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
surrendering the animals so then then
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
the situation arises well they can get a
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to arrest you and it can kind of
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
go down that road but that doesn't solve
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the problem of trying to avoid having a
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
criminal case more often my
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
understanding more often than not most
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
people and I don't have exact statistics
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
but when they whether it's a restraining
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
order or whatnot most people comply with
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
the order at least try to comp
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
because they know that's in of itself
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
another offense
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
so it would still help it wouldn't solve
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
your problem 100% but it
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
would I think it's better than going
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
that route at least if you can reduce
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
the charges by 60 70% that's still I
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
win okay just making some notes here
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting some great information
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to wrap up on this
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill here
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
shortly because I've got another one I
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
have to hear so excuse me another one we
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
have to work on question yeah so um I'm
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
not so uh a violation is considered a
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
civil offense not a um criminal offense
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
correct or is that or does it depend
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question so I'm
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
talking hyp pathetically speaking if
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was an order a a chapter in the in
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
the law for you to get a civil order to
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
address this every time I've seen
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's a harassment prevention
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
order uh domestic violence restraining
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
order I all these if so when it comes in
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
violing a court order let's say the
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
court orders you to produce your
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license and you just refuse to
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
refuse to do it you can be that case you
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
can be criminal contempt or it can be
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
civil contemp type of situation but when
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
it comes to violating a order of the
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
court of this it's a restraining order
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that is it is
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
generally G to be a criminal
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
charge the the Civil it's not going to
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
be a civil penalty now the penalty can
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
be a violation and it doesn't have to be
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
jail time but again the order without
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
there being a penalty for violing the
 
00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:23.039 align:start position:0%
order the order has no key I've never
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
seen one I know last term we had uh the
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
proposed red flag bill it was HB 687
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
that had a provision in there uh and I
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
know the issue of the warrants and
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
everything came up in that conversation
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
well how do you get a warrant if there's
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
no crime um that was one of the few few
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations that was put in to an
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that addressed that the crime
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
is now violating the order so that would
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to be a criminal
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
offense so I I I guess what I'm
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
wondering is is there um is there a way
 
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.549 align:start position:0%
wondering is is there um is there a way
that

01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
um the if the um if it if if the ca if
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
there is a criminal charge uh and and
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly there under existing statute
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
if someone is uh neglecting their
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
animals to the point of Cruelty then uh
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
that is that is there is uh R you know
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
RSA U 68 688
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
6448 definitely has the criteria for
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
that being a criminal charge but if it
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
if that comes to trial uh is there a way
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
that a uh a judge would be able to
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
create a settlement that
 
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.710 align:start position:0%
create a settlement that
would

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh end up um not having the person uh
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
you being
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
um having a criminal charge on their
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
record but at the same time uh being
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
able to uh M make sure that that person
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
does not um is not further able to have
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
care so thank you for the question so
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a I guess a plea that's
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
can be entered uh my
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
experience is that if the defendant and
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
the state are an agreement
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
it 99 of 100 times it's getting approved
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
if not more than that by the court if
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
the state wants to agree to drop the
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
charges or you can have some type of
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
diversion program in place to avoid the
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
conviction once if that's the case and
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
the case is dropped or dismissed what
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
not that person should be eligible for
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
an analment if it's doesn't I I do
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
apologize I I know we had this last term
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
too I I forget if it actually happens
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
operational law or you have to actually
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
apply for the en um if you have to apply
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
for it then it's it's just some
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
administrative paperwork but once that
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
happens even though you're found not
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
guilty or the case has dropped it is
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's still that would not appear
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere and that's that's something
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
that I know when we had the analment
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills last term in uh criminal justice
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
Public Safety uh I think they all passed
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
on uh consent there wasn't we all
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
supported the only one we had any issue
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
with was um Senate Bill 311 so that we
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
don't need to get that that was well the
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
application of it
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
so so so there might be a mechanism for
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
um for the animals to be taken away from
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
someone who take can't take care of them
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
and that person end up not with a
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
criminal charge on their record under
 
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.630 align:start position:0%
criminal charge on their record under
existing

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
statute yes and as part of a disposition
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
person can agree to voluntarily
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
surrender the animals and I would think
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
that that would be persuasive I mean
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
some some may argue dur rest there
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
saying we'll drop the charges if you
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
give up your rights to you know your
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
property here so I can I can see some
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
some lawyers really uh frowning at that
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
but at the same time if if I'm
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
representing someone and it's it's a
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
tough case to beat and I said all you
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
got to do is give up the animals and
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's gone
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
in Li of jail time I I would I would re
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
I would tell them that that's your
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
choice but I would recommend giving up
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
the the title if that's what it takes so
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the courts so and criminal cases
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't like to get involved in
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
civil settlements per se because they're
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
they're separate and it gets a little
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
dicey when it comes like witness
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
intimidation or you're bribing a witness
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
I'll pay you this or you give me an
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
extra 10 grand I'll it's really has to
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
be careful how that is done because it
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
could be multiple felonies inadvertently
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
committed that's why having legal
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
council do it it's usually done in a way
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
that's part of a bigger scheme and if
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's approved by the court and the
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
person has Council I don't see that
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
being any duress or constitutional issue
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
there they they should have been
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
explained what they're giving up but
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
that can be done uh and but I don't
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
think that I'm not sure the judge has
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
the authority to to just simply say all
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to drop the case but you
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
got to give up your you're taking away
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
your rights to the animals I I I don't
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
think the Judge could just do that
 
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.349 align:start position:0%
think the Judge could just do that
finding

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
disposition thank you so I'm going to
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
wrap up here in the next excuse me next
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes on House Bill 366 is
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
there any uh last questions or comments
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
from anyone on the committee or any of
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'm going to uh
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%

session on hell Bill 366 but I want to
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank all of you this has been a great
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
conversation I probably have more pages
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
of notes from this than almost any other
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
Bill I've worked on I'm not sure I'll be
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
able to uh go back and understand and
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
digest them all but I'm G to need a
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
little time
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
to I really want to thank uh chairman
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
abis for coming in and spending so much

time with our committee because as you
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
can see is a very complicated bill for
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
us to handle sort of out of our area
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
anytime we're blending personal property
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
which is live would you know with the
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
policy of animal care and with criminal
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%

certainly appreciate your expertise and
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay welcome
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
back we're back from RE
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
and we will now begin the work session
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 585 an act allowing the
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
free payment of dog licenses fees for
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
the duration of the rabies vaccination
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
and reducing fines related there
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
too so the prime sponsor uh rep Lon was
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
not able to join us today because she
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
has committee work of Rome so we're
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
gonna kind to just have a conversation
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
about this bill and talk about some of
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
the things that we uh discussed back in
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
hearing there's some concerns that I had
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
about how this bill would impact the
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
department of a for
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue you
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
know there's some concerns that uh were
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
raised by some of the town or city
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
clerks I think we've probably got some
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill that we're not
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be able to answer
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
today we can certainly talk about
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have as a
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee but Bixby is there anything
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to I know you and I had
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
a conversation about this is there
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
anything that you'd like to start off
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
with and bring up some concerns that you
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
have yeah um I think uh well there there
 
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.709 align:start position:0%
have yeah um I think uh well there there
are

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
two two concerns I have one is um that
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think that um we shouldn't be doing
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
anything with the current um
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the current uh schedule of fines for
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
um for not for not registering I think
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
th those fines are you know are just I
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
think that that issue we I don't think
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with at all um in terms
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the registration period I
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh that the the main impact of that is
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
going to be um you people can it would
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
be convenient for dog owners to only
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to register every uh three years
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure how that's going to
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
impact Municipal clerks and uh it might
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
vary from um from town to town and City
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
to city as to whether it would how
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
workable that would be um and uh my
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
feeling is that uh if there are
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
um a number of Municipal clerks who
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
think that this would work for their
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
Community then we could set it up as
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation if the general
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
feeling among the municipal clerks is
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
that uh this is just more trouble than
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's worth I don't think that it uh
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
further yeah there's a list of questions
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
that my town clerk gave me
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
that don't know that we got all of them
 
01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:27.990 align:start position:0%
that don't know that we got all of them
answered

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
and not sure exactly how we do get all
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
answered you know that that becomes the
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
challenge um there's certainly a lengthy
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
list that she gave
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
me so I'm trying to decide how we would
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
best proceed as a committee on on
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting some of these questions answered
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I think maybe uh perhaps we could reach
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
out to the municipal Association and
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
they might be good resource for us or
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps a town clerk the clerk there is
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
a Clerk's Association as well perhaps
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
they would be a good
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
resource I think the department of a
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
probably needs to weigh in with some
 
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:09.380 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how this will affect their
 
01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.229 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how this will affect their
[Music]

01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
revenue there a couple that I had
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee that says
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
some thoughts on this and how they think
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
proceed I think we're all kind of
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this Bill trying to decide uh
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know the concept is certainly
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
seeing yeah I I think um it might be
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
good to get um input from the clerk's
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Association and the municipal
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
Association and see if they would be in
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
favor of having this set up as a sort of
 
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.750 align:start position:0%
favor of having this set up as a sort of
enabling

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
legislation and if there and if the
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
answer from uh those two associations is
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
no then I think that we could just um
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
not go forward with it if the if the
 
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
answer is yes then we can spend some
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
time figuring out how to make it work
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately another thought I had too
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
was perhaps doing keeping this in
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee for a little bit longer and
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
studying it a bit further because there
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
is to me some far-reaching ramifications
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
of this again I I have a list of about
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
eight questions that my clerk gave me
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
which probably is a pretty good starting
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
point with the clerk's Association to U
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
work you know we get into the situation
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
where perhaps in the first year it's a
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
non-altered dog and then in year or two
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
the dog is altered and that would change
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Fe structure and there's just a lot
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
of moving parts to this when you go more
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
than one year I think it brings in some
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
right I I think um well um what would if
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
you could just uh let us know what the
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions that you uh your your clerk
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
gave you then maybe we can
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
um that would be useful sure I could
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
scan it but I've written all over it oh
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
oh well now can you H is it possible for
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
you just to just to read them out right
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
now and we of I I will do that all right
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
so these are the list of questions that
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
she provided what if the person has
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
multiple dogs with multiple rabies
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
expiration dates so they could have
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
three dogs that all expired in different
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
years what about puppies with only a
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
booster that's don't always provide
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
rabies paperwork in a timely fashion how
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
would that impact this
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
bill if it's done for three years and
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
someone has three non-altered dogs nine
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
bucks each equaling $27 and the licenses
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
for three years times three they are
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
$90 roughly is that you know would that
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
be a burden that someone want to pay and
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
I guess that would be up to the person
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was deciding whether they wanted to
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
go for three years I mean I don't view
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
this as being mandatory I view this as
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
being U you know allowing them to do it
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
choose uh what if a dog a non-altered
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
dog is altered after they pay for
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
three-year license will they be looking
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
for money back would there be a refund
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
policy what if the licensed dog dies
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
during the three-year period again will
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement clerks purchasing dog tags
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
how would they plan for that how many
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
order that was the end of her question
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
the last was a statement which says it
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
appears that it may actually be more
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
work to change the current method of dog
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
licensing than to leave it as is
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
that was the input that IED from my
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
la so I'm thinking perhaps we should uh
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
the next work session we have on this
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill we should invite ask Clerk's
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
Association the municipal Association
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
and the department of a to weigh in on
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
the various areas that would impact them
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
that be something agreeable to you as a
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee is there other people you'd
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.719 --> 01:20:33.629 align:start position:0%
 
ah

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
head all right anybody else you'd like
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
to hear from on this obviously I think
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
reple on at some point would like to be
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
able to come back in and address the
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee when when she doesn't have a
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
conflict so I'll certainly uh work on
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
setting up another work
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
session I mean it's obvious this bill is
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
going to need some more work as well as
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
the last one um
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
I you know the last bill may need
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
significant work and that may take some
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
time I kind of want to get a feel for
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
what the subcommittee thought on this
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
feeling anybody want to weigh in rep go
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah I was just curious if if this
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
is something that the municipalities and
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
everyone is really on board with would
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
we would we maybe start a new
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
program this is just I'm just kind of
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
brain I don't know if this is
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate but it seems to me that
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
maybe current the current setup can't
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
handle the three-year and that we would
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
have to almost implement it as if if you
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
get a new puppy you can start you can
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
start this three year now but if you
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
already have a dog in the system you
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
can't really apply to this right that's
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the way it is now am I
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly sorry if
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is an inappropriate injection I'm
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
just a little
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
bit this is a not confused session it's
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
a great place to ask the question so
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
your thoughts start the program with a
 
01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:01.719 align:start position:0%
new dog and let it track every three
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
years as it went through its R
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
cycle I mean again it feels like more
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
work but maybe it's an option I don't
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
know it could be an option but thanks
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yeah that down as
 
01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.030 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yeah that down as
a

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah we we can certainly
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
develop a list of questions if we want
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
to I mean I can use the ones that I have
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
as a starting point that we could send
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
to the clerks and the municipal
 
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
Association and the department of act
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
for that matter and ask them to sort of
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
look at these questions and then look at
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
the bill come up with some some input
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
for us that's agreeable to all of
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
you certainly if there's other questions
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
you want uh you think of after we're
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
done with this just uh shoot me an email
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll put together a
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
list not sure when we'll get back on to
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
this because we're already on to May
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
20th it may be a while before we can get
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
back on the schedule again to get
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
another work session but we certainly
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
have plenty of time that was part of the
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
reason I wanted to look at these two
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
bills now and U get an opportunity to to
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
together anything further you want to
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill all right seeing none uh we do have
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
a presentation for the whole committee
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
coming at 1M from many of the different
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
faculty from un and looking forward to
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
that so I will put us in recess until 1M
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll return for the presentation
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
then

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:53.310 align:start position:0%

Sciences and Agriculture
 
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I joined the University of New
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just last fall in September of
 
02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
2020 I'm a Forester by training and I
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually grew up about six hours
 
02:54:36.269 --> 02:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
Northeast of here in St John New
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
Brunswick Canada went to work for a tree
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
nursery up in uh Northern Ontario after
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
finishing my undergraduate degree uh
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
loved the work found that all I wanted
 
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
to know was more and more about how
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
trees grow and that pushed me into
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
Graduate School uh at Purdue University
 
02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:56.710 align:start position:0%
Graduate School uh at Purdue University
in

02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
Indiana after that I worked at the
 
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
University of uh Idaho uh running a tree
 
02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
seedling program and then in a number of
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh administrative roles at the College
 
02:55:09.870 --> 02:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
of Forestry at Oregon State University
 
02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
so a really extensive uh broad set of
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
experiences in the land grant mission of
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
teaching research and service service
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
which I think are absolutely vital
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
towards uh sustaining our our rural
 
02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
economies and ecosystems and and uh I'll
 
02:55:28.229 --> 02:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
dive into that a little bit
 
02:55:28.239 --> 02:55:30.030 align:start position:0%
dive into that a little bit
more

02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
um I get asked the question why is the
 
02:55:35.550 --> 02:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
College of Life Sciences The Way It Is
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
What do you do as this college of Life
 
02:55:39.229 --> 02:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
Sciences and agriculture why aren't you
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
a college of Agriculture and so building
 
02:55:45.469 --> 02:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
that umbrella of what do we do the
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
College of Life Sciences and agriculture
 
02:55:50.309 --> 02:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
champion Innovation and inclusion to
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
conduct engaged teaching research and
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
Outreach that addresses social and
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
natural challenges to achieve
 
02:55:59.590 --> 02:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
sustainable lives and livelihoods we do
 
02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
that at a scale that absolutely as the
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
flagship uh University for New Hampshire
 
02:56:07.469 --> 02:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
impacts us here across the state we do
 
02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
this in Partnership to lead in the
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
country and we do this for the world
 
02:56:12.429 --> 02:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
both to bring experiences here and to
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
export our knowledge elsewhere we have
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous thought leadership in
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
developing new technologies in this
 
02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
college and in helping those
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
Technologies be applied on our
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
agricultural lands in our Laboratories
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh in addressing challenges to how
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
people eat and what they eat and
 
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond I'm not going to read the list of
 
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
our undergraduate degrees some of you
 
02:56:36.190 --> 02:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar with them but we
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
range from A to Z from animal science to
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
to zoology with uh many many stops in
 
02:56:46.510 --> 02:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
between and we also operate the Thompson
 
02:56:49.070 --> 02:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
School of applied sciences where we have
 
02:56:51.229 --> 02:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh three three Associates degrees
 
02:56:52.750 --> 02:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
programs a little bit different from
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
some of our University peers in that we
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
have both bachelor's degrees and uh
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
Associates degrees we have our applied
 
02:57:00.750 --> 02:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
animal science our forest technology and
 
02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
our Veterinary technology programs and
 
02:57:06.190 --> 02:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
honestly these are programs that I think
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
are gerine to so many of the small
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
businesses and and family run operations
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
we see in New Hampshire but you can look
 
02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
at the current enrollment which is the
 
02:57:17.229 --> 02:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
number in parentheses and see that we
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to make these
 
02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
programs accessible and affordable to
 
02:57:23.070 --> 02:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
people who need the content of these
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
programs to keep them uh being sustained
 
02:57:25.439 --> 02:57:28.150 align:start position:0%
programs to keep them uh being sustained
moving

02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
forward uh in terms of undergraduate
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment across the four departments
 
02:57:35.070 --> 02:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the Thompson School uh you can see
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're relatively balanced in those
 
02:57:39.190 --> 02:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
four uh departments our biggest being
 
02:57:41.070 --> 02:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
molecular cellular and biomedical
 
02:57:43.469 --> 02:57:43.479 align:start position:0%
Sciences that's likely not a surprise
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
when we think about the uh demands for
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
increasing stem Workforce uh whether
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's going into the uh production of
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines which we all uh appreciate so
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
much right now or uh for folks who are
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
entering into our health care
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
System um again seeing that small school
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
number here I think that's something
 
02:58:03.389 --> 02:58:03.399 align:start position:0%
that just shows we're going to have to
 
02:58:05.830 --> 02:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
figure out where do we go with this uh
 
02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
this opportunity in the
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
future I pulled out some numbers that I
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
thought would be of particular interest
 
02:58:16.110 --> 02:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh to to this committee and really just
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
to highlight the Hands-On experience
 
02:58:21.269 --> 02:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
that our undergraduate students get and
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's that First Column that you'll see
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
internship and research
 
02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
participation over 80% on average of our
 
02:58:29.870 --> 02:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
students get a hands-on experience
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
either in a research lab or by doing an
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
internship during their undergraduate
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
experience here and when we look at our
 
02:58:39.550 --> 02:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
post completion data what do people take
 
02:58:40.990 --> 02:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
away as students who have come through
 
02:58:44.269 --> 02:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
our programs we lead in those Hands-On
 
02:58:46.110 --> 02:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
experiences they set people up to be
 
02:58:48.110 --> 02:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
more successful in their jobs when they
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
start their jobs and to go on to be more
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
successful in research careers if they
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
happen to choose a research career and
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
so it's not really surprising that as we
 
02:58:58.469 --> 02:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
move over to the other two columns we
 
02:59:00.910 --> 02:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
see that uh collectively we're seeing
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
less than 10% of our graduat graduating
 
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
students having to look for work whether
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to go on to get more
 
02:59:10.229 --> 02:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
advanced education or that they've taken
 
02:59:12.910 --> 02:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
a job um that they're that they're
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's keeping them out of looking for
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
other work that to me is fundamental to
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
why we offer the mix of degrees that we
 
02:59:25.229 --> 02:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
offer Student Success isn't just about
 
02:59:27.389 --> 02:59:27.399 align:start position:0%
students completing a set number of
 
02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
courses in a certain trajectory it's
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
about collecting the experiences along
 
02:59:34.750 --> 02:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
the way that allow them to be gainfully
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
employed that allow them to further
 
02:59:38.429 --> 02:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
themselves and hopefully come back to
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
lead in their communities in our
 
02:59:42.229 --> 02:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
businesses uh as they move forward with
 
02:59:42.239 --> 02:59:45.070 align:start position:0%
businesses uh as they move forward with
their

02:59:45.070 --> 02:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
careers what part of what drew me to the
 
02:59:50.190 --> 02:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire was the the
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
research that's conducted in the College
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
of Life Sciences and agriculture matters
 
02:59:57.389 --> 02:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
this is really really fundamentally
 
02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
important to us because we are a small
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
state we are a small University we have
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
to conduct research that's both uh
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
generating new knowledge and taking that
 
03:00:07.389 --> 03:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
new knowledge and helping it be uh
 
03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
transcended and applied and um we do
 
03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
this at a pretty big scale we've seen
 
03:00:16.590 --> 03:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
how the research that we have generates
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
new ideas informs change
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
it helps our businesses adapt it helps
 
03:00:22.830 --> 03:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
us figure out what crops to grow where
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
to grow them and how and we do it at a
 
03:00:27.309 --> 03:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
scale that's of about 15 million a year
 
03:00:29.110 --> 03:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
for our college alone spending on
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
Research which is significant for a
 
03:00:32.349 --> 03:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
university our
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
size and so uh it was actually exciting
 
03:00:38.349 --> 03:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
this morning to see on nhpr the lead
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
story was on H novel tree syrups and
 
03:00:43.229 --> 03:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
some research being conducted right here
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
out of the college and I just think
 
03:00:46.269 --> 03:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of innovation that we
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
want to see where moves into uh a
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
tourist supporting industry where as
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this article restaurants
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
are excited about these or for us to be
 
03:00:58.830 --> 03:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
better able to understand how things
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
like drought conditions could affect
 
03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
something as vital to uh New Hampshire
 
03:01:06.990 --> 03:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
as syrup production timing and
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
quantity we've also got a really strong
 
03:01:11.469 --> 03:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development component some of
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we see in the internship programs
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned as well as in
 
03:01:17.389 --> 03:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
investing in our students and pushing
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
them to come up with their own ideas to
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
work with faculty to develop those and
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
then to partner with groups like UNH
 
03:01:25.269 --> 03:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
Innovation and the entrepreneurship
 
03:01:26.830 --> 03:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
Center to be able to take these ideas
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
forward whether you're a faculty member
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
or an undergraduate student or anyone in
 
03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
between and we're poised for
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
growth uh you're likely aware of the
 
03:01:40.349 --> 03:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
balding uh the Spalding biological
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
sciences initiative this is a a big step
 
03:01:45.950 --> 03:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
forward for our University for our
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
College it puts about
 
03:01:50.469 --> 03:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
18,000 uh square feet in
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art research and teaching
 
03:01:55.550 --> 03:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
space on the dock for two years from now
 
03:01:58.030 --> 03:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
this is huge for us and this gives us
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
capacity to to have about 250 more
 
03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
students each uh year in life sciences
 
03:02:06.429 --> 03:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
and agriculture programs and we need
 
03:02:08.389 --> 03:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
those graduates we need our stem
 
03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
capacity to
 
03:02:11.710 --> 03:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
expand and I know with some of my
 
03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the call um it's great to
 
03:02:16.510 --> 03:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
see them here and we are finding ways to
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
navigate Financial challenges and
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
partner with uh our peers like
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension and the school of
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
Marine Science and ocean engineering to
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
make strategic hires so that we're we're
 
03:02:30.110 --> 03:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
taking everything we have right now and
 
03:02:32.190 --> 03:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
leveraging to be able to get the best
 
03:02:34.750 --> 03:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
possible return on investment that we
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
have uh uh that we can moving
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
forward so uh just to to wrap up briefly
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh you'll be hearing from our College a
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
lot more we just launched launched our
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
first uh uh print magazine which
 
03:02:51.630 --> 03:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
actually I'll be sending a copy to each
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh of the members of the committee uh
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
soon after we finish our call today
 
03:02:58.110 --> 03:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be pushing out more virtual uh
 
03:02:59.309 --> 03:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities whether it's through
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
webinars and trainings or simply through
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
updates on on on Twitter or other
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
platforms and we're really excited to
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
get around to visit people on the farm
 
03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the forest to be able to come and see
 
03:03:13.469 --> 03:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
meet with people in their offices and
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
really set up that strategic direction
 
03:03:18.030 --> 03:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to see to be able to make
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
sure that our college is addressing the
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
challenges that need to be addressed
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire now and into the
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
future so thank you for the opportunity
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
to speak and I will stop here and I I am
 
03:03:35.710 --> 03:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
happy to uh take questions or pass along
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
to one of my
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues thank you very much for uh
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
the presentation you certainly uh piqu
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
my interest a bit uh there's several of
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
us on the committee who are maple Sur
 
03:03:50.790 --> 03:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
producers so uh when you get into that
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
Arena you you certainly caught my
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
attention I actually had a question
 
03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
myself for you uh so the vettech program
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
did did I understand you to say this 43
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
students in the Vette Tech program
 
03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct there are current
 
03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
currently 43 students in that program
 
03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
wow do they uh primarily large animal
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
small animal or a mix of both uh
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
actually I will uh that's a great
 
03:04:15.510 --> 03:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't think we have
 
03:04:18.030 --> 03:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
specialization tracks in the vet Tech
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
program so this is a more General and I
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
can turn to my colleague Dave to
 
03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh correct me if I misspoke there yeah
 
03:04:29.309 --> 03:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
it does represent it does represent
 
03:04:34.110 --> 03:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
across a broad range of large and small
 
03:04:37.269 --> 03:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
animals I would say there's probably I
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what 70% of the time is on
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
smaller animals um but uh but but it
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
does span the full
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
range excellent it's ALS it's also one
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the other exciting dimensions of that
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
program is um a very
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
creative way that the faculty have been
 
03:05:02.190 --> 03:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
working to launch a two plus two program
 
03:05:05.229 --> 03:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
so we take the two-year program which is
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
which is an awesome program unto itself
 
03:05:11.590 --> 03:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
but the students now have an option
 
03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
where if they chose to continue on after
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
the two-year
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
degree they uh they've got their courses
 
03:05:20.590 --> 03:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
set up in a way that they just continue
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
right along toward the four-year degree
 
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
and we have about um a quarter of the
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
students in the program choosing that
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
option and we're we're very excited
 
03:05:31.950 --> 03:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
about that well that's great because
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's certainly uh very important to
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
the animal industry in New Hampshire to
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
have some vext in in the queue
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely all right I'll open it up to
 
03:05:40.990 --> 03:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee any other
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Eric go ahead
 
03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and thank you so much
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for uh your
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
presentation is very very interesting
 
03:05:52.510 --> 03:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm glad to see so much interest
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm interested to know though with
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
the student population that you're
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
serving do you uh track how many of
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
those students are coming from Farm
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
families or rural areas versus uh you
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
environments that's a great question and
 
03:06:19.269 --> 03:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh I haven't looked at that level of uh
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
granularity at the data but uh
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative eron I'd be happy to
 
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on that and I will
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
ask our data people uh what we have uh
 
03:06:30.670 --> 03:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
access to it is Our intention moving
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
forward with our recruitment uh programs
 
03:06:35.710 --> 03:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
and materials to be much more specific
 
03:06:38.910 --> 03:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
in where we maintain a stronger
 
03:06:42.510 --> 03:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
University College department or program
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
presence to be able to better connect
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
with prospective uh high school students
 
03:06:49.070 --> 03:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
are post uh High School aged uh
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
potential students and have them really
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
be aware of the the rich career
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities that come from uh the
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire so that that
 
03:07:01.229 --> 03:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
data I suspect does exist and I haven't
 
03:07:03.870 --> 03:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
yet looked into it oh I really be
 
03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
interested as a followup so you muted
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
you oh sorry oh you're on the Sor no um
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm really interested for to hear uh
 
03:07:18.469 --> 03:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh data just a you know
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
matter of course as to where students
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
are coming from are they basically
 
03:07:25.229 --> 03:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
following in their family footsteps are
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
they just something that's interesting
 
03:07:31.469 --> 03:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
for them uh you know as a topic from
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to improve the environment or
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to um farming advances and
 
03:07:38.590 --> 03:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so thank you I hope
 
03:07:40.590 --> 03:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
you will follow up with it I certainly
 
03:07:42.590 --> 03:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
will thank you for the
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:50.910 --> 03:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm fighting with my uh my mute
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
button thank you thank you for very much
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
for the presentation and also um thank
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
you for the additional information I
 
03:07:59.710 --> 03:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
just want to piggyback on to rep eron's
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
question and uh my question is that I
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
just wonder in your if you can find this
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
out or if you just happen to have the
 
03:08:09.309 --> 03:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
information uh what percentage of your
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
students uh might be from instate versus
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
out of state and the the second part to
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
that is if you if you do have sort of a
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
lower out of State rate that you would
 
03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
like I just wondered your perspective on
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you feel like our you know the
 
03:08:26.229 --> 03:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
tuition comparison from other states is
 
03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a you know an obstacle to
 
03:08:31.110 --> 03:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
overcome to attract people from out of
 
03:08:34.510 --> 03:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative homo
 
03:08:36.349 --> 03:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful question and I think
 
03:08:39.070 --> 03:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
you said I had four hours to speak about
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
that so and we'll use every one of them
 
03:08:47.790 --> 03:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's great I um I spent I spend a lot
 
03:08:50.110 --> 03:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
of time that's the actually the level of
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
granularity of data that I've been
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time looking at our
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
challenge is not in recruiting outof
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
State students to the University of New
 
03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our challenge is in recruiting
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
instate students into our College into
 
03:09:05.309 --> 03:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
our programs in the University of New
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's partly where that
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
idea of messaging comes out and being
 
03:09:12.190 --> 03:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
able to build a better understanding of
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
how strong our programs are roughly uh
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the numbers right here
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's roughly
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
2third of our students I'm trying to see
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
if it's right over there roughly
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of our students uh uh maybe
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
three fifths of our students are out of
 
03:09:32.110 --> 03:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
state so less than half are instate
 
03:09:35.469 --> 03:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
students and that's important for us to
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
address because we see this in the
 
03:09:39.229 --> 03:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
entire recruitment pipeline we don't get
 
03:09:41.550 --> 03:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
as many instate students applying as I
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
believe programs of our quality should
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
see applying it's it's um
 
03:09:50.910 --> 03:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
vital that we help our prospective
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
students see that the quality of
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
lecturers instructors uh professors
 
03:09:59.229 --> 03:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
teaching assistant research
 
03:10:01.469 --> 03:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities support services that you
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
have at the University of New Hampshire
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
actually exceed most of our peer
 
03:10:08.590 --> 03:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
institutions we have excellent learning
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
and teaching opportunities for students
 
03:10:12.110 --> 03:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
here we have to find a way to
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
communicate that with our communities
 
03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
and uh across the state in order to
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
really boost that inate uh those instate
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh recruitment opportunities it will be
 
03:10:23.790 --> 03:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
good for New Hampshire and it will be
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
good for society when we get to that
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
point thank you so much thank you hey
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
rep Murray has a question I do thank you
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
question um and thank you um Megan can
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
you step into the microphone a little
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
bit more we having a hard time hearing
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
you sure is that better yep sorry about
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
better uh so thank you for taking my
 
03:10:49.469 --> 03:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
question I was just going to ask what
 
03:10:53.630 --> 03:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
you saw as potentially
 
03:10:57.590 --> 03:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
a the relationship of that that uh less
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
than half of the students who are in
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
state what is detracting them from
 
03:11:03.469 --> 03:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
remaining in state or are they going
 
03:11:05.429 --> 03:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
elsewhere can you elaborate on that or
 
03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
have you fleshed that out to any degree
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Marie for
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
the question it's I'd say we're early in
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
the fleshing out we need to do some more
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we need to do genuine market research
 
03:11:22.229 --> 03:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
but from my own
 
03:11:25.150 --> 03:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
um from the initial spaces and this is
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
something the university is really
 
03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
seeking to address collectively not not
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
only in our college or our programs but
 
03:11:35.389 --> 03:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
we likely need to be more engaged in
 
03:11:37.790 --> 03:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
social media strategies and
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
communicating uh compelling stories of
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
both what the university experience
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
means and why the UNH University
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
experience can be a superior Superior
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
one not to a specific peer but for kind
 
03:11:52.750 --> 03:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the generational change the last
 
03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
person that should design a um
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
recruitment program for potential
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
undergrads is probably someone my age
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's it needs to be contemporary for the
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
likely students that we have coming in
 
03:12:06.590 --> 03:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
and so I think as we are evolving and
 
03:12:08.349 --> 03:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking into what does that how do
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
you do that um we need to get there
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
we've had some good response to a couple
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
of trial balloons that we've put out but
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
it is a an important strategy and the
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
the fundamental piece that I that I hope
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
is clear in this strategy is our degrees
 
03:12:28.030 --> 03:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
are good ones so what we're actually
 
03:12:30.910 --> 03:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
putting out there for people is a great
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
return on investment for them so it is
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
an investment in our next generation and
 
03:12:39.070 --> 03:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's the important part of recruitment
 
03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
when you have strong programs and
 
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
relatively lower enrollments we're not
 
03:12:45.269 --> 03:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
chasing students to increase tuition
 
03:12:48.110 --> 03:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
dollars we're chasing students to impact
 
03:12:50.790 --> 03:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
our businesses our ecosystems our Farms
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
our forests our oceans in positive ways
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
because they'll be better served to do
 
03:12:57.389 --> 03:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
it if they have a degree from us we
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
think I think than if they have it from
 
03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
our peers so maybe in a year I can give
 
03:13:05.150 --> 03:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
you a more comprehensive answer about
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
some things that worked or didn't that'd
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
be fantastic thank you thank you Dean
 
03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
Davis I do enjoy that little bit of
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
Canadian accent that keeps sneaking in
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
there on
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
you all right we'll take one more more
 
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
question from representative Bixby and
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
then in the interest time we'll move on
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh so um I was wondering what
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
sort whether you have there are sort of
 
03:13:31.469 --> 03:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
Cooperative connections between UNH uh
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
between csal researchers and uh New
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farmers uh or New Hampshire
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
businesses where there's a a sort of a
 
03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
Cooperative program in terms of
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
involving non-university people with the
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
University Research
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's a this is a thank you very much
 
03:13:50.349 --> 03:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bix for the question
 
03:13:52.750 --> 03:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually a great uh transitional
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
question too depending on which way we
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
go next but um my colleague Anton
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
Beckerman is associate Dean in our
 
03:14:00.269 --> 03:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
College as well as the Director of the
 
03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agricultural experiment
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
station and in that particular direction
 
03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
our the majority of our researchers at
 
03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
the experiment station are are faculty
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
in this College college and there is
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
often a very tight connection between
 
03:14:17.790 --> 03:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
our producers Network and research
 
03:14:21.070 --> 03:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
Network one of the areas that we've been
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh seeking to expand and uh my
 
03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues in Cooperative Extension led
 
03:14:30.190 --> 03:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
by uh Ken L valy is in shared positions
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
between our two units that have an
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
extension component as well as a
 
03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
teaching and small research component in
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
our College I think ideally one of the
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
end outcomes is we're better
 
03:14:44.830 --> 03:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
engaged across the state through our
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
extension Network and connecting that
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
back both to our teaching and our
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
research because we're sharing
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
information more effectively and and we
 
03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
all know that the uh hiring has been
 
03:14:57.870 --> 03:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for for a decade or more even
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
at uh this University we have had more
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies emerge than we've had
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
Physicians come into uh replace them so
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
as we look to get creative to fill those
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
gaps those gaps aren't just designed to
 
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
get us to some baseline Staffing level
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're designed to maximize the impact
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that our work has across the communities
 
03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
and so our uh I as our college embarks
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
on a strategic planning process I think
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
what we'll see is a network where we're
 
03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
engaged with small businesses we're
 
03:15:29.550 --> 03:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
engaged with communities we have our
 
03:15:32.110 --> 03:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
students in as as intermediaries going
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
back and forth taking information
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
bringing back questions we have advisers
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
sitting on our advisory boards who are
 
03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
bringing forward questions that are
 
03:15:42.670 --> 03:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
gerine to Maple Sy production or dairy
 
03:15:45.790 --> 03:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
production or oyster production or soil
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
conservation or
 
03:15:50.110 --> 03:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh prolonged routes all of those
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions I think we have some
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
individual networks our College will
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
take those and find a way to create them
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
into a pipeline where we have a really
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
strong two-way flow I think over the
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
next few years so I'd put it in the
 
03:16:06.510 --> 03:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
emerging strengths bucket if I had to
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
assign it somewhere and also in the
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
bucket thank you well Dean co uh Dean
 
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me Dean Davis thank you for your
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
presentation I think with that we will
 
03:16:25.269 --> 03:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh go next to uh director Anton
 
03:16:27.309 --> 03:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
Beckerman from he is the director of the
 
03:16:29.309 --> 03:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agricultural experiment
 
03:16:29.319 --> 03:16:31.389 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agricultural experiment

will also share a presentation that I
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
had put together and hopefully you can
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
see that we can go ahead excellent well
 
03:16:46.110 --> 03:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again for inviting

your New Hampshire agricultural
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
experiment station and similar to Dr
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
Davis I am also relatively new to UNH
 
03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
and to New Hampshire I spent the last 11
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
years at Montana State University uh
 
03:17:06.189 --> 03:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
both as as an agricultural economics
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
faculty member and I also served as the
 
03:17:12.070 --> 03:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
associate director of the Montana egg
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
experiment station um but I am very
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
excited to join the vibrant leadership
 
03:17:22.750 --> 03:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
team here at un and to help facilitate
 
03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh some of the most important science
 
03:17:27.389 --> 03:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
and engagement Endeavors at least in my
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
opinion um that that we do here for for
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
many of our communities um a little bit
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
about how I view the role of the a
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
experiment station and while maybe most
 
03:17:43.469 --> 03:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
of you likely know the station for
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
having a number of excellent research
 
03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
farms and Dairy facil facilities and the
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
green houses that we have here in Durham
 
03:17:53.229 --> 03:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
more importantly the station represents
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
one of the state's longest running
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
public research and development hubs for
 
03:18:01.469 --> 03:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
agricultural food and natural resource
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
issues our goal is to strategically
 
03:18:08.990 --> 03:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
Steward and maximize the return on the
 
03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
federal and state public funds to help
 
03:18:15.349 --> 03:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
answer questions that well don't have
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
answers quite yet uh our scientists
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
identify and work on solutions to
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that are maybe already
 
03:18:25.950 --> 03:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
hampering the economic and societal
 
03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
well-being of granite Staters but also
 
03:18:32.349 --> 03:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
work on questions like how will New
 
03:18:34.990 --> 03:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our region our nation our
 
03:18:37.710 --> 03:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
world respond to the food and natural
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
resource and environmental challenges
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
that are five and 10 and 25 and 50 years
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
away and when those issues do become
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
salient in five or 10 or 25 or 50 years
 
03:18:52.349 --> 03:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
it's the research from this experiment
 
03:18:54.429 --> 03:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
station that will help provide those
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
science-based guidances to overcome
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
those challenges and that's really the
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
essence of what we do we're here to
 
03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
provide that science based
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
guidance uh the way that we're
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
structured really reflects the
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
commitment to the langr mission that we
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
have it's the people it's the programs
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's the places the station brings
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
together those worldclass scientists
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
from across numerous disciplines to
 
03:19:27.389 --> 03:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
address those locally inspired critical
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions and and to that stakeholder
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
question that's that's exactly we
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
include those stakeholders as those
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
members of of the people that are part
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
of our station that they're not just the
 
03:19:42.670 --> 03:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
the folks who you know we provide that n
 
03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
science too but those stakeholders help
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
us understand what are those problems
 
03:19:50.429 --> 03:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
that we're facing now and that we may
 
03:19:55.110 --> 03:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
face in 5 to 10 and 25 years a food the
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
natural resources Environmental Quality
 
03:20:00.189 --> 03:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
in different ways they're important to
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
basically every single community in New
 
03:20:06.030 --> 03:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we consider every person
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the state our stakeholder and our
 
03:20:10.830 --> 03:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
scientists take on Research that can
 
03:20:13.630 --> 03:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
benefit a large number of people and try
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
to answer questions that you know maybe
 
03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
too big or too risky for say a small
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
private Farm or a family business to
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
take on but in answering those questions
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the outcomes can have these huge huge
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
long-term benefits that touch the many
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
diverse communities uh in our state and
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
region uh just to give you an idea of
 
03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
kind of what we look like by the Numbers
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh as you can see we have over 50
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
research programs that our scientists uh
 
03:20:48.189 --> 03:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
currently have on going and and they
 
03:20:50.830 --> 03:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
really live up to the idea that the a
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
experiment station funding provides the
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to test that initial that
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
that kernel of an idea maybe it's a
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
risky but really huge idea that can
 
03:21:04.110 --> 03:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
solve many of the challenges that our
 
03:21:06.070 --> 03:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
state and region face today and
 
03:21:08.110 --> 03:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
something that may need to start and
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
maybe a lab and have some basic
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge be developed and then bring
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
that into a more applied setting uh that
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
can then be used to apply for those
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
external resources and build on those
 
03:21:24.910 --> 03:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
ideas and expand and attract and train
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
the best PhD students and attract the
 
03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
best faculty to really enforce that
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
positive Loop and relative to the stock
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
market you can see the a R&amp;D that we
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
have and the return on that investment
 
03:21:42.750 --> 03:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
relative to both the stock market and
 
03:21:45.469 --> 03:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
many other states you know we provide
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
one heck of a big bang for the buck um
 
03:21:51.630 --> 03:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
and that that $15 million that Anthony
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
that Dr Davis shared as our annual
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
expenditure well our researchers have
 
03:21:59.389 --> 03:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
brought in in the past several years
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
close to $24 million that over the next
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
three to five years will contribute to
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
that $15
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
million annual expenditures that's over
 
03:22:12.429 --> 03:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
a four nearly a
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
400% return on the investment that the
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
federal government and the state
 
03:22:21.030 --> 03:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
government here in New Hampshire makes
 
03:22:24.750 --> 03:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
research I I wish I wish that I could
 
03:22:30.269 --> 03:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
show you everything that we do uh it's
 
03:22:32.349 --> 03:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
really hard to describe all the impacts
 
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
that we make but here's just a few
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
highlights um as you can see there's
 
03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
been a focus on and there still is a
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
focus on plant genetics which is much
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
more of a long-term uh concept and and
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
product there's production
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh and management which is medium and
 
03:22:50.950 --> 03:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
shortterm production and management
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
resiliency to different risks like
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
product like like weather uncertainties
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
and Market uncertainties we are leading
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the fields of curbit development uh
 
03:23:04.990 --> 03:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
those squashes and melons for New
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
England and organic Dairy research and
 
03:23:11.590 --> 03:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
we look to the economic opportunities
 
03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
that are growing in the state like the
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry and and support
 
03:23:17.309 --> 03:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
those Industries with three research I
 
03:23:20.269 --> 03:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
looked at the recent statistics and New
 
03:23:23.110 --> 03:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the fastest growing state
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the nation in terms of aquacultural
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
production where are we going looking
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
forward where here's a really brief
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
summary of our ongoing scientific work
 
03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
we see a real opportunity to become a
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
regional leader in local food system
 
03:23:41.590 --> 03:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
security looking at things like
 
03:23:43.189 --> 03:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
increased production capacity during
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
cooler months resiliency of our local
 
03:23:48.590 --> 03:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
Supply chains which have been especially
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
tested during the pandemic producing
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
food that can actually be more
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
nutritious not just make more of it but
 
03:23:57.070 --> 03:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
make better food and more nutritious
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
increasing small farms opportunities to
 
03:24:01.950 --> 03:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
diversify and and reduce their input use
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
and cost and build strength against
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
Market uncertainties we have a great set
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
of researchers working on soil
 
03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
microbiology and alternative pest weed
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
and insect management approaches and
 
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
also looking at numerous aspects of
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
forest man management and the existence
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
of value added products like that maple
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
syrup and maybe putting some of that
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
maple syrup into beer and making really
 
03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate products that can bring
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh into the marketplace
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
and make people think hey uh this is
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
kind of unique and and cool um that
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's really just a a snapshot of the
 
03:24:39.389 --> 03:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
really neat things that our scientists
 
03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
are working on and the station helps
 
03:24:44.590 --> 03:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
facilitate in terms of the research
 
03:24:47.950 --> 03:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
Endeavors so let me end with that um and
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end by reiterating that I
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the committee's
 
03:24:53.550 --> 03:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing support of the experiment
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
station really excited about where we're
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
heading and the vibrancy that uh that
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
our scientists are bringing to the
 
03:25:04.590 --> 03:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
experiment station work and really
 
03:25:07.950 --> 03:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
making uh an impact by increasing the
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
direct communication and engagement
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
between our scientists and our
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders across the state so thank
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
you very much I I'll stop sharing and uh
 
03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to take uh some questions
 
03:25:21.389 --> 03:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
if uh you Mr chairman of the committee
 
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
have any thank you director Beckerman I
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
know you certainly hit two of my
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
favorite topics with maple syrup and
 
03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:29.269 align:start position:0%
favorite topics with maple syrup and
beer

03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
beer
 
03:25:33.030 --> 03:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I am I happen to produce farm for
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
my day life and I've grown some of Dr
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
ly's curbit varieties over in the past
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
that he has grown especially uh in the
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
winter squash varieties and uh one
 
03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
question I had you mentioned that you
 
03:25:48.590 --> 03:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
were um worked in Montana previously so
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
what do you see for similarities or
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
differences between New Hampshire and
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
Montana in the in the research that you
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
do well Mr chairman members of committee
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh I did I driving a little bit around
 
03:26:02.590 --> 03:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
the state uh in the past nine months I
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
did not see a lot of 10,000 acre wheat
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
Farms um so that was a bit different uh
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's you know one of the things that is
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh both similar is that even though
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
Montana is a much larger State the
 
03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
population numbers are very similar uh
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that is certainly uh a challenge to
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
to some extent but also an opportunity
 
03:26:31.950 --> 03:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
to think about the local food systems
 
03:26:34.269 --> 03:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
that can emerge across the different
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
communities uh for which maybe
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
traditional Supply chains don't work and
 
03:26:42.429 --> 03:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking primarily about maybe the
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
the Central and Northern parts of of the
 
03:26:45.439 --> 03:26:46.830 align:start position:0%
the Central and Northern parts of of the
state

03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:26:49.389 --> 03:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
um you know the other opportunity that
 
03:26:52.030 --> 03:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
that I see a lot of is the ability to
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
diversify and the ability to look to
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
Alternative and um resilient management
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
practices that come around through
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
various research Endeavors to
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
protect producers and consumers from
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
those Market uncertainties um as as an
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
agricultural Economist I think a lot
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
about risk and uncertainty and the the
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
challenges that come about from that
 
03:27:25.870 --> 03:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
because of of just not knowing what the
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
next year can bring and in food markets
 
03:27:30.670 --> 03:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
that is a particularly important uh risk
 
03:27:34.830 --> 03:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
factor um I I think that the value added
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
component is another aspect that was
 
03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
emerging in Montana because the
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
commodity markets are you know wheat
 
03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
markets became pretty weak in my time
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
there and a lot of producers were
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about well how do I overcome
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
these these challenges and and I think
 
03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
the uh ability to diversify uh is
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
already highly ingrained in uh the small
 
03:28:04.830 --> 03:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh Farm ethos here in New Hampshire and
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
New England but I think what we can
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
bring to the table is really structured
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
science-based knowledge of how to
 
03:28:16.269 --> 03:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
diversify what are the best approaches
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
to managing both your production and
 
03:28:22.469 --> 03:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
your economic aspects of the uh of of
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
your business how do we look at a
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh capability of bringing
 
03:28:32.349 --> 03:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
together these separate perhaps
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
communities of local food producers in a
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
way that can Elevate all producers and
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
consumers in the state so I think
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about uh the state as a more
 
03:28:47.309 --> 03:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
cohesive unit rather than communities
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
that are disparate and and separated um
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
I think that is a really important
 
03:28:57.670 --> 03:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
similarity that that I think both States
 
03:29:00.830 --> 03:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
um have a lot of opportunities uh to to
 
03:29:00.840 --> 03:29:01.630 align:start position:0%
um have a lot of opportunities uh to to
take

03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:29:05.189 --> 03:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
on thank you certainly diversification
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has been the key to
 
03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture forever since you know since
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
we've been here but okay U thank you for
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
that I I appreciate the answer uh rep
 
03:29:17.070 --> 03:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you so much Mr chair and
 
03:29:19.630 --> 03:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for this wonderful
 
03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
presentation I know I certainly
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of the um uh updates that
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
I received from uh your your office
 
03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
about different findings and uh new
 
03:29:36.070 --> 03:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
things that you've discovered or awards
 
03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
that you're winning and that kind of
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
thing but um I'm I've always been
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
curious as
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
to when you make certain discoveries or
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
you have certain results from the
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
experiments that you run or the you know
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
things that your uh students or
 
03:29:57.269 --> 03:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
researchers are doing how does that
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
translate and how is that disseminated
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
to our farmers and to say backyard uh
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
Growers uh do you offer certain classes
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
is there uh sort of how-to guides that
 
03:30:17.710 --> 03:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
you share with everybody h how does your
 
03:30:20.910 --> 03:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
discoveries get shared and
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
implemented Mr chairman representative
 
03:30:25.550 --> 03:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
Aon thank you for the question uh that
 
03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so there are two
 
03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
aspects to our engagement and Outreach
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
efforts one of course is the more uh I
 
03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
guess the tri tripart uh approach of the
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
of a l Grant University which is sort of
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
the the teaching uh aspect the
 
03:30:49.469 --> 03:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
research uh and and the extension and
 
03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
working with our extension Partners uh
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is something that is has
 
03:30:56.910 --> 03:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally been done and working with
 
03:30:59.229 --> 03:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
extension professionals uh and
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
collaborating collaborations between the
 
03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
scientists and extension professionals
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh is is a really important Avenue and I
 
03:31:10.910 --> 03:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
think uh Dr L Val will will speak to to
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
their efforts um in in disseminating
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
some of uh the signs that that our
 
03:31:18.630 --> 03:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
researchers produce um so that's
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
certainly one approach is is using those
 
03:31:24.750 --> 03:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh connections between our researchers
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
and our extension
 
03:31:30.030 --> 03:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh another approach that I
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
think is something that I in Vision
 
03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
really growing is the direct uh
 
03:31:37.950 --> 03:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
communication between the scientists and
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders um we would we have
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
started a field day series that we've
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
been having for the past two months and
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
we would like to continue that on a
 
03:31:51.189 --> 03:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
monthly basis we've had a field day that
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
was an AES an experiment station field
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
day on maple syrup production uh we've
 
03:32:00.429 --> 03:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
had a a a a field day on seedless grape
 
03:32:02.429 --> 03:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
variety production we're having a field
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
day on June 15th on Dairy production and
 
03:32:08.189 --> 03:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
specifically colostrum and and the
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of of that um and as soon as we
 
03:32:15.870 --> 03:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
are able to uh we will begin several
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
endeav to take our scientists on the
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
road on a much more frequent basis we
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
would really like to increase the access
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
between the communities around the state
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
and our scientists directly um and part
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
of that is going to be taking people
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
putting them in a car and and having us
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
go out there into the communities and
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
and speaking to them I don't think it's
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable to assume that every time
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
those communities are going to come to
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
Durham so that that is really a a big
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
um uh goal for for me to really bring uh
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
that component to the experiment station
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
and of course uh you know we've been
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
working on updating our website uh we
 
03:32:59.670 --> 03:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
put all of our information on our web on
 
03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
our website uh we have the monthly
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
newsletters our Communications manager
 
03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
has really elevated the amount of
 
03:33:10.990 --> 03:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
information that goes out there and we
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
really punch above our uh size in terms
 
03:33:16.349 --> 03:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
of national
 
03:33:20.110 --> 03:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
in getting notied by the USDA by the US
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh secretary of agriculture uh he often
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
gets briefs with New Hampshire a
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
experiment station stories included uh
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
in in those briefs so um we have uh we
 
03:33:37.950 --> 03:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
have room for growth um in connecting
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
more directly but uh I think we have a
 
03:33:44.670 --> 03:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
really solid foundation in in doing that
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Bixby thank you
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so uh one issue
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
that has come through our committee um
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the last uh C two or three terms is
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh development of hemp as a uh crop in
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I was wondering if the
 
03:34:06.389 --> 03:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
experiment station has anyone who's
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
working on that uh Mr chairman
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh thank you for
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
the question um coming from Montana hemp
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
is uh a well-known topic to me as as
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
they were one of the first states to
 
03:34:22.269 --> 03:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
adopt state level rules on hemp
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
production there was a lot of uh
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
interest there um to my knowledge there
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
is no research happening on hemp right
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
now um that is something I I'm I'm not
 
03:34:35.469 --> 03:34:35.479 align:start position:0%
sure of any researchers who may be
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
potentially interested in in hemp
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
production um so that's that's the short
 
03:34:44.189 --> 03:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
answer I think the longer answer is uh
 
03:34:47.469 --> 03:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
we are here to respond to to local
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
locally inspired issues that's that's
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
what we do and if there is an interest
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
and a need for us to look into hemp
 
03:34:59.710 --> 03:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
research and to help science guide
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
production and management techniques I
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
would be very glad to facilitate that
 
03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
discussion and and and have that
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
conversation so um that's not not an
 
03:35:13.150 --> 03:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
answer or maybe a longer answer or a
 
03:35:17.309 --> 03:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
convoluted answer but um yeah
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we are on
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
H okay thank you any other questions uh
 
03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:24.429 align:start position:0%
H okay thank you any other questions uh
rep

03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
rep
 
03:35:28.189 --> 03:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
stable uh thank you Mr chair and uh
 
03:35:31.590 --> 03:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the lovely presentation um
 
03:35:34.510 --> 03:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
I I noticed that there seems to be a a
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
growth in the coastal and aquaculture
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
area and um that uh that has a lot of
 
03:35:46.189 --> 03:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
potential um for need and food products
 
03:35:48.990 --> 03:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
and and so forth I was wondering how
 
03:35:52.189 --> 03:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
much of that particular area is
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
attracting students from um out of state
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
from other areas that have an interest
 
03:35:57.560 --> 03:35:58.990 align:start position:0%
from other areas that have an interest
in

03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman represent ston thank
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
you uh I I can't really speak to the
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
student aspect maybe I can defer that to
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues either Dr Davis or
 
03:36:13.389 --> 03:36:13.399 align:start position:0%
Dr Mortenson um I do know that the
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry is uh growing it's
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's an important industry here in New
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh both uh in on on the coast
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
and in the Inland parts of the State uh
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
we do have research on oysters on uh uh
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
finfish on sort of identifying pests in
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
aquacultural production identifying uh
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
barriers and challenges to and economic
 
03:36:43.710 --> 03:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
barriers to agricultural production and
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that is uh an area of growth
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
especially within the context of doing
 
03:36:51.790 --> 03:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
so in growing that industry in a
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
resilient way that will maintain the
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
tourism opportunities and the
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
environmental uh benefits that that our
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
state gets from uh the the various uh
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
water uh features that we have here um
 
03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
so that perhaps uh that that will play
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
an emerging role if it isn't already
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
again in in attracting more students who
 
03:37:21.870 --> 03:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
are interested in those areas um but I
 
03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
can't speak directly to the question
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
about student
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
numbers thank you very much I I could
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
just chime in there this is Dave
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
Mortenson um the student interest is
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
High um and
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're one of this the spirit a spirit
 
03:37:43.870 --> 03:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
that is being conveyed here with the
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the new leadership
 
03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
in the college is um
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
Grassroots bubbling up of ideas for new
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
program areas there's a group of Faculty
 
03:37:58.510 --> 03:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I along with the department
 
03:38:01.150 --> 03:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
chair of the biology Department have
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
been having regular meetings and
 
03:38:06.510 --> 03:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
discussions about the potential to
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
launch an aquaculture and sustainable
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Fisheries um undergraduate program and
 
03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh we've been doing cursory assessments
 
03:38:19.389 --> 03:38:19.399 align:start position:0%
of student interest and we have a very
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
active aquaculture uh Club on campus
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
that um the kids are largely running
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
with two of our uh teacher extension
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
Specialists uh who work he you know very
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
much focused on aquaculture so so I I
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's I would imagine we will see an
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
increasing activity in this area on the
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
campus over the next couple of
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
years thank you for that additional
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
information okay thank you thank you
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
director Beckerman uh we appreciate your
 
03:38:56.110 --> 03:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
presentation and I think that's a great
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
leading to uh bring up Professor David
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
mortensson he is the professor of
 
03:39:04.110 --> 03:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
agroecology and Food
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
muted sorry about that that's okay I
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
think we we got you now go ahead okay
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
great um yeah so what one of the things
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
striking about
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
being here is it's it's an exciting
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
time uh because of a number of
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
things uh and one of those things that's
 
03:39:59.550 --> 03:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
exciting is that we have a leadership
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
team that's new and uh a leadership team
 
03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:05.150 align:start position:0%
team that's new and uh a leadership team
that's

03:40:05.150 --> 03:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
um excited about growing things and and
 
03:40:12.429 --> 03:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
and listening to stakeholders as we as
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
we explore ways of growing programs for
 
03:40:16.279 --> 03:40:17.189 align:start position:0%
we explore ways of growing programs for
our

03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
students and programs for our students
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
that then go on to fill positions in the
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
state and in the region uh and I'm very
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
excited to be a part of that newer
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
member of team members I
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
arrived a little over two years ago um I
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
had been at Penn State and before that
 
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
at the University of
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
Nebraska uh the department that I chair
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Agriculture
 
03:40:48.189 --> 03:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
nutrition and food systems and it was
 
03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
through a restructuring that occurred uh
 
03:40:52.830 --> 03:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
and that was completed in
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
2017 this department arose out of that
 
03:40:59.630 --> 03:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
restructuring prior to that uh faculty
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
that were working in animal science
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
would have been in biology department
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
and faculty working in Plant Pathology
 
03:41:10.269 --> 03:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
of you know diseases of crops would have
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
been working in the molecular and
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
cellular biology Department we now have
 
03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
our faculty aggregated with focused
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
interest on agriculture nutrition and
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Food Systems and we're very excited
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
about that along with the um the
 
03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
aggregation of Faculty with shared
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
interest in their teaching and
 
03:41:38.030 --> 03:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
research we um are excited to have a
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
greater number of our folks in a smaller
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
number of buildings so that we're
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
working in very close proximity to each
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
other in this in had it not been for co
 
03:41:52.110 --> 03:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh the building that I'm sitting in
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
Kendall Hall would have been fully
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
occupied by a move of
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
extension uh
 
03:42:03.149 --> 03:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
agriculturalists um to the third floor
 
03:42:06.030 --> 03:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
of this building and the fourth floor
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
both floors fully renovated in the last
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
year um would be folks working on you
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
know animal and um plant agricultural
 
03:42:17.550 --> 03:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
issues and the only reason we're not
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
fully occupied in the building are the
 
03:42:22.710 --> 03:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
covid regulations and we're very excited
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
as those begin to relax uh that and
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing people um coming into the
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
building um the other thing that was
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
already said by Dean Davis and I I just
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
I will just uh like to just emphasize
 
03:42:42.030 --> 03:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
again um is this beautiful thing that's
 
03:42:46.510 --> 03:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
happening here where we are
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
actively matching up positions sharing
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of those positions across the
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
College of Life Sciences and Agriculture
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
and our extension program and this is a
 
03:43:03.550 --> 03:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
really good thing for the the question
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh that representative Aaron had about
 
03:43:08.990 --> 03:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
um getting the results of the science
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
out to the stakeholders out to the
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
farmers um out to the food processors um
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
this will help us do that much better
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
and it helps us address uh establishing
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
and sustaining critical need of of folks
 
03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
working in important areas for our state
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
and region and over the last last years
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
since since I arrived we've been
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time thinking about
 
03:43:38.830 --> 03:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
how do you create a a a sustainable vet
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
tech program how do you leverage off of
 
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
that cool vet tech program to form a two
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
plus two degree program where our
 
03:43:49.389 --> 03:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
students have greater flexibility to
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
pursue uh exciting and interesting
 
03:43:55.870 --> 03:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
degree options so our department has six
 
03:43:55.880 --> 03:43:57.269 align:start position:0%
degree options so our department has six
undergraduate

03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
undergraduate
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
programs an applied animal science
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
program the the Thompson school program
 
03:44:05.309 --> 03:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
um a four-year animal Science Program
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
which is our most rapidly growing
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
program in uh in the department and I
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
and I will say just just sometimes there
 
03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:15.550 align:start position:0%
and I will say just just sometimes there
is

03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:17.710 --> 03:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
the thought that that the students
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
aren't coming from Farms or going back
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
to Farms our animal Science Program uh
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
now has 135 Majors um it's been
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
increasing about 15% a year over the
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
last three years and I would say half of
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
those students are coming from farms and
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
a good number of them are going back to
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
Farms mostly in this state or in
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
adjacent States we have a sustainable a
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
and food systems program human nutrition
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
and wellness and the equin
 
03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:54.670 align:start position:0%
and wellness and the equin
program

03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
um again back to the to the question of
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
how it is that we get information out to
 
03:45:05.309 --> 03:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
the state this this uh we've had a a
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
strange year as as I know your committee
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
has had a strange year um our seminar
 
03:45:13.870 --> 03:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
which was always done in person was done
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
through Zoom
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
and we had more and more extension
 
03:45:20.590 --> 03:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
Specialists from across the state
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
joining the seminar series each week
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that we progressed into the spring
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
semester which was a blast because they
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
were joining and enriching the
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
conversations and just last Friday Elena
 
03:45:38.429 --> 03:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
enen enan uh one of our master's degree
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
candidates in the department an
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
undergraduate graduate from our animal
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
science program and now an extension
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
specialist in Dairy livestock and forage
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
crops here's a case where Elena is
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
actually conducting research while also
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
working full-time with our extension
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
service so A beautiful example of
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
addressing a research problem in this
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
case expansion of beef production in the
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
state and and and surrounding states and
 
03:46:12.510 --> 03:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
getting the word out directly uh you
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
know through um her programming that
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
she's doing at the state
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
level um our animal science program this
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
was taken the year before covid so the
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
kids are unmasked but this was something
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
that happened in our animal Arena the
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
animal Science Program um is extremely
 
03:46:36.149 --> 03:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
active and as I was mentioning earlier a
 
03:46:39.750 --> 03:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the students um have I mean their
 
03:46:42.030 --> 03:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
their interest is to work with animals
 
03:46:44.149 --> 03:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
for their career and want to do what I
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
would say most of them in the state and
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
region our students come from all
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
backgrounds rural um and urban I would I
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the statistics in front of me
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
but I would estimate that a greater
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
proportion are rural than Urban um and
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're a mixed Bunch um and I
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd give you a glimpse into
 
03:47:10.110 --> 03:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
the background of a couple of them uh
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
today we have four commencement
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
functions for our six commence uh
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
undergraduate programs and tomorrow
 
03:47:21.070 --> 03:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
evening is in-person commencement for
 
03:47:25.030 --> 03:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
our kids uh this is Kyle Bloom with his
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
wife Sophie Kyle came to us um after um
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
getting out of the service having
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
completed two tours of Duty in IR Rock
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
he uh is a among a growing number of
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
veterans returning to school and Kyle um
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
has a farm and his wife Sophie have a
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
farm in the southeast part of the State
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh and um he's he's just been a gem to
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
have in our program and I think all of
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
our students have benefit they benefit
 
03:48:03.309 --> 03:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
from one another much of our curriculum
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
is engaged scholarship meaning there's a
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
serious Hands-On component of this and
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
seeing the students working together
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
across the Vari backgrounds that they
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
come to our programs with it's it's just
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
a real joy for me and the other faculty
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
program here's a group of students that
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
were working on um Hydroponics work that
 
03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
is underway in the department and the
 
03:48:35.950 --> 03:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
the the student with the blue stretchy
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
knit cap uh I asked Katherine who I just
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
saw at the commencement event before
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting on the zoom call here if she
 
03:48:46.750 --> 03:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
would share a little bit about her plans
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
Katherine graduates
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and Katherine is going to be
 
03:48:55.550 --> 03:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
joining one of our new split appointment
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
extension research faculty Anna
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
Wallingford to work on Pest Management
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
of vegetable crops and it's Katherine's
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
interest that uh through these engaged
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship activities that she's had
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
while she's been with us that she would
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
go on to do uh Outreach education in the
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
area of vegetables and Pest
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
Management so um the
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
45 or so majors in our department um and
 
03:49:29.950 --> 03:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh this past year our department I'm
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
proud to report taught 179 courses to
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
3,400 of our UNH undergraduate students
 
03:49:42.269 --> 03:49:42.279 align:start position:0%
but the department is live and well and
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
um we're excited as we uh are also
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
growing to the Future to fill out the
 
03:49:51.389 --> 03:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
the role of our department and I'll end
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
there and be happy to answer any
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%

the bills that we passed out of our
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee was a uh Bill studying the U
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
need for uh butchering services and
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
whatnot for uh the meat industry and
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
that may be something that Elena may be
 
03:50:28.110 --> 03:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at and testifying
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
to that uh to that work committee when
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's developed um to talk about the
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
things she's found and what's holding
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
back the expanding the beef production
 
03:50:39.149 --> 03:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
so that might be something of interest
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
you could mention to her I'm sure I'm
 
03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
sure she would be because she's
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
conducted a uh uh a survey both of
 
03:50:50.710 --> 03:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
processors and of producers and has
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
current in fact that was like half of
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
her seminar so she has really good data
 
03:50:58.590 --> 03:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
on and and there is no question as
 
03:51:01.469 --> 03:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
you're pointing out the bottl neck to
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
beef production in the state is the
 
03:51:06.070 --> 03:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
processing capacity certainly well any
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
information she would like to send to
 
03:51:09.070 --> 03:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
the committee we'd always be interested
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
in looking at and sure so with that I'll
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
go to representative
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
Bixby and um I think representative
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
Pearl was kind of reading my mind on
 
03:51:21.550 --> 03:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
that one sorry so but so but I have a
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
slightly different angle on the question
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
which is that I was wondering if there
 
03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh would be any room in the applied
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
animal science program for uh developing
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
a program to educate people who are
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
interested in becoming um butchers and
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
slaughterers uh to um so that we can
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
essentially have a homegrown Supply of
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
business I I think that's a great idea
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
um we are just uh and I and I say it's
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
Ken lali's group that's been
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
spearheading the search but we've been
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
participating that college has on a food
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
safety position and that food safety
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
position which will be extension and um
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
some applied research and teaching
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
um has to do with uh both the safe
 
03:52:22.349 --> 03:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
handling and processing of vegetables as
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
well as meat products so we're moving in
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
a direction to have greater capacity to
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
do that uh and I think that suggestion
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
is a great one
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
um and we definitely need to figure out
 
03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
a way to grow that that capacity here in
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
the state and in the in the surrounding
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
states as well in fact this was
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
considered the bottleneck to meat
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
production in Pennsylvania as
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
well yeah from my understanding it's a
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
problem all across the
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
country yeah partic particularly the
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
smaller to small midsized operators are
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
but but it is across the country um yeah
 
03:53:10.510 --> 03:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you H representative Murray oh did
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
you have a follow represent I just had
 
03:53:14.670 --> 03:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that I um I noticed that
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
the USDA was had a um a comment period
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh food chain um so food
 
03:53:29.269 --> 03:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and uh and grant
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities or you know where where
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
they might uh spend some of their create
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
some grant opportunities and I uh so the
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh there might be some federal money or
 
03:53:42.149 --> 03:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
there might be a way of um pushing to
 
03:53:45.550 --> 03:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
get some federal money to um help uh
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
develop that program
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
further yeah and again I uh Elena is
 
03:53:56.590 --> 03:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
working in that space and um but but but
 
03:53:58.750 --> 03:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
take come put together the training
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
program that's a great suggestion
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah hey thank you representative Murray
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr ter for taking my
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
question Professor Mortenson I had a
 
03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
quick question um I have three really
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
young kiddos and two of whom have have
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
shown a particular interest in in really
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
understanding where their food comes
 
03:54:20.269 --> 03:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
from and knowing that so can you speak
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
at all to the farm to school program in
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or is that in your
 
03:54:26.229 --> 03:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse or is that under somebody
 
03:54:29.229 --> 03:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
else's director um
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
Direction yeah so I see that Stacy purlo
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
is on and this this is she and Aaron
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
hail this would be in their wheelhouse
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
um not not that it's not an interest of
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
the faculty in the department but I know
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
they're working on it actively and more
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
informed about that than I perfect okay
 
03:54:50.080 --> 03:54:52.070 align:start position:0%
informed about that than I perfect okay

uh Robert Gibson who is in charge of the
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
hello thank you let me um share my

ahead
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh chairman Pearl and
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee members for inviting us today
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your service to the
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
state and on this committee I'm Robert
 
03:55:57.030 --> 03:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
Gibson I'm the managing director of the
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterinary Diagnostic lab
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
and I am pleased to share with you some
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
background about the lab and the
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
essential services that we provide uh
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
for New
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the lab was created by an act
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
of uh legisl the legislature uh in a
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
statute in 1969
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh it was dedicated to our late State
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian Dr Smith uh and we've been
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
providing essential diagnostic services
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and the region for over
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
50 years our mission statement
 
03:56:28.110 --> 03:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
essentially comes from the statute which
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
defines our role as providing
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics in the detection of diseases
 
03:56:35.550 --> 03:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
that impact animal and public health
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of stakeholders who
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
rely on our services and I'll provide uh
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
some examples in a moment
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
the organizational structure of our lab
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
is fairly typical for most Veterinary
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
diagnostic Labs uh Most states have
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
Veterinary diagnostic labs they are
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
typically located at land grant
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
universities or universities that have
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
veterinary schools and they generally
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
have a shared oversight and funding
 
03:57:04.030 --> 03:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
structure from multiple sources so we
 
03:57:06.429 --> 03:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
have the University of New Hampshire uh
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
where we are located here in Durham and
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the University we provide uh
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
teaching and training to students in in
 
03:57:17.149 --> 03:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
various Majors including the preet
 
03:57:19.229 --> 03:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
program uh so we have three boarded
 
03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Pathologists who teach
 
03:57:23.550 --> 03:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
courses and and do advising uh for the
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
college uh additionally we employ uh
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
students um uh as employees uh who get
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
hand on hands-on experience in the lab
 
03:57:33.309 --> 03:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
and then we have uh the New Hampshire
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and uh they
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
provide some of our funding as well and
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
we report to them through the
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the state veterinarian
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh for and we'll talk more about their
 
03:57:48.269 --> 03:57:48.279 align:start position:0%
role the stakeholder um services that we
 
03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
provide to them and then the third
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
component is our fee for service
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
revenues and so the the prices that we
 
03:57:58.349 --> 03:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
charge for certain testing to our
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
Veterinary clients and other uh
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and so it's it's the fee
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
for service revenue is about 50% of our
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
our budget and then the other funding
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
that we get from the University of New
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Department of Agriculture
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
makes up the remainder
 
03:58:16.590 --> 03:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh we are the largest uh Veterinary
 
03:58:18.790 --> 03:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab in Northern New England
 
03:58:20.429 --> 03:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
and by volume we are probably the
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
largest one uh in New England I said
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
Most states have Veterinary diagnostic
 
03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
labs in New England um they're not as as
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
large again ours is probably the largest
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts doesn't have one so we
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually do a lot of testing for
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the diagnostic labs in
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh Maine and Vermont don't have
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Pathologists and so our
 
03:58:42.149 --> 03:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
Pathologists do provide a lot of
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
services um to the region and that's
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
important because New England has lots
 
03:58:49.870 --> 03:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
of small states close together we share
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
borders and you know what's happening in
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
one state is of relevance to our
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and so um animal and
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
public health uh is important for for
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
all of us um the testing that we do in
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
these other states uh also uh provides
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue to our lab to help
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
support the testing that we do for our
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
own State um the the structure where we
 
03:59:15.790 --> 03:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
have um uh the fif for service the
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
university and the Department of
 
03:59:19.149 --> 03:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
Agriculture it's it's a win-win for
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
everybody because each of the entities
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
on their own would have trouble
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
affording uh a lab of this nature and so
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
when everybody joins in again it's a
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
win-win for for everybody
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
involved um for stakeholders so I
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Department of Agriculture
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
we provide uh regulatory disease testing
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
for the state veterinarian and
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture diseases
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
such as Aven influenza brucelosis
 
03:59:46.269 --> 03:59:46.279 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire was actually the first
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
state to be declared brucelosis free
 
03:59:52.349 --> 03:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
back in 19 uh 63 U but declared free of
 
03:59:54.990 --> 03:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
brucelosis by the USDA we also are
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
looking out for foreign animal diseases
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
AGR terrorism all of the the things that
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
would uh threatened uh New Hampshire
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh and the economy again for
 
04:00:06.269 --> 04:00:06.279 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire as one
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
of our key stakeholders I did mention
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
that on the academic side teaching and
 
04:00:13.149 --> 04:00:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh advising for students student
 
04:00:13.159 --> 04:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
uh advising for students student
employees

04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
um getting hands-on experience um we
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
provide support for the agricultural
 
04:00:20.590 --> 04:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
experiment station Farms doing
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
diagnostics for the dairies and such um
 
04:00:25.149 --> 04:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
we also provide support to the animal
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
resource office on campus so uh any
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
research animals or studies that are
 
04:00:32.110 --> 04:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
being done we we will provide um
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
pathology and disease testing in those
 
04:00:36.110 --> 04:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
instances and we work closely with
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension uh and the
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
livestock agent U Specialists that are
 
04:00:44.149 --> 04:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
in the field to educate producers so
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they know what services are
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
available uh from the lab for them uh
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Hospital clients
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarians so we have hundreds of
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
Veterinary clients around New Hampshire
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
around uh New England uh the New
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterinary Medical Association
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
um is a a big supporter of the lab they
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
have a standing committee um that uh
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
reviews what what the lab is is doing so
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
um our Veterinary clients and again that
 
04:01:12.149 --> 04:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
fee for service component is is um
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
probably the largest part of our our
 
04:01:14.439 --> 04:01:15.550 align:start position:0%
probably the largest part of our our
lab's

04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
lab's
 
04:01:17.710 --> 04:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh we do work for the New
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game department uh
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
Wildlife disease Diagnostics uh that's a
 
04:01:25.389 --> 04:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
large and growing area for our lab um
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife diseases are are critical
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
to animal and human health um we are
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
living all on the edge of of of the
 
04:01:35.710 --> 04:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
wildlife and domestic uh interface as as
 
04:01:39.790 --> 04:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
we um come in contact with with these uh
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
animals and um in addition to New
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game we actually do
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
most of the diagnostic work for fishing
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
game departments in uh Maine Vermont and
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well um and we've done
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
some big studies on Canada links and
 
04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
moose um and such uh um loons if a loon
 
04:02:04.349 --> 04:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
dies on a New Hampshire Lake typically
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
comes to us for autopsy uh so w Wildlife
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
is is a very large and growing segment
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
of what we do um preservation agencies
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
science centers um any diagnostic needs
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
they have uh for the animals that they
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
care for we work closely with the New
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Health laboratory so we
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
um with rabies testing West virus Triple
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
E food safety uh disease outbreak
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
investigations uh we're part of the
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory response Network for biot
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
terrorism uh want to keep in mind that
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
the top biot terrorism agents according
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
to the CDC um such as brucelosis Taria
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
plague Anthrax these are all classic
 
04:02:46.830 --> 04:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
animal diseases so Animal Health and
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
Human Health are are definitely linked
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
um zoonotic diseases the majority of
 
04:02:54.429 --> 04:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases of people are
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
zoonotic they come from animals 75% of
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
all the newly emerging disease threats
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we read about and see in the news
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
these are all animal
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
diseases um we're part of the New
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire arboviral task force uh again
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're on the lookout for emerging
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
diseases and and we are routinely
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
discovering and finding emerging
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
diseases whether it be diptheria in a
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
horse or carbapenam resistant ecoli in a
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
dog we are seeing um all of these
 
04:03:26.110 --> 04:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
emerging diseases right here and uh um
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're making the diagnosis for
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
these uh I mentioned the New Hampshire
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association they're a
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of us and all of their
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarians their their membership uh
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
we do provide services too uh we also
 
04:03:42.510 --> 04:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
serve the USDA Federal veterinarians in
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
our region uh with various Diagnostics
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
needed for different disease
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
investigations that they're doing in the
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
field I mentioned surrounding New
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
England states um for example
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts doesn't have a Diagnostic
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
lab so we do all the poultry testing for
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts and that
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
brings in Revenue to our our state um so
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
we do a variety of State contracts with
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
our New England neighbors uh livestock
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
producers we all know how hard it is for
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh producer producers to get access to
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
large animal veterinarians and so we
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
have opened up some of our testing
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
directly to Farmers and producers to
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
help fill that Gap um whereas most of
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
our samples especially regulatory
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
testing and things like that have to
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
have a veterinarian submit the sample
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
there are certain tests that we can open
 
04:04:31.269 --> 04:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
up for large animal uh producers um and
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
backyard poultry owners for
 
04:04:33.479 --> 04:04:35.630 align:start position:0%
backyard poultry owners for
example

04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
um commercial backyard poultry uh
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
another big segment of of the work that
 
04:04:42.750 --> 04:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
we do we provide services to zoos
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
aquariums um uh we work with the Farm
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
Bureau for their membership and making
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
sure that they're aware of what services
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
the lab can provide um to help them
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
maintain healthy uh flocks and and
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
livestock we work with law enforcement
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
agencies so when you hear about abuse
 
04:05:04.110 --> 04:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
neglect hoarding instances uh very often
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh those animals do come to our lab for
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
autopsy um and so both from New
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and out of state we do receive
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
um autopsy from log
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement um Marine Mammal stranding
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
um we do work with Marine strand uh
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
stranding agencies and so we do the
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
autopsies on uh marine mammals that come
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
up on New Hampshire beaches as well as
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
in Maine and uh sometimes in
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts too um previously it was
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned about aquaculture we do have a
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
growing segment of aquaculture clients
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
um so some of our Pathologists have uh
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
specialty training and experience in
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
aquaculture and the the very various
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
bacterial and V viral diseases that they
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
are plagued with um and so we
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
practically on a daily basis receive
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
specimens from various aquaculture uh
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
companies so it's a very U this is a
 
04:05:59.710 --> 04:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
basic list of of of stakeholders it's a
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
very large group we very much function
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
under a on health umbrella which
 
04:06:07.070 --> 04:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
includes uh animal health human health
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
environmental health uh because they are
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
all integral and they all uh are
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
important to each
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
other um this is just a a quick look at
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
uh our new facility um we built the lab
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
in 2015 I mentioned we've been on campus
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
for 50 years um this facility that we're
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
in now was built in
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
2015 um we're very happy very excited to
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
be here I have taken previous um uh Ena
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
committee on tours of the lab so um as
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
things settle out from Co I would love
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
to welcome you to the lab for a tour at
 
04:06:45.149 --> 04:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
any time um that that's convenient for
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
you um I mentioned uh we have a lot of
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
student opportunities too some of the
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
the pictures there contain some of our
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
students so um that's the end of my my
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I would just say reach out
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
to me anytime uh this is your lab um and
 
04:07:06.030 --> 04:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
we are here to serve you and uh uh
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
animal health public health and
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
agriculture in New Hampshire so thank
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
you I'll take any
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you director Gibson that
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
certainly all those Services you perform
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
are essential to agriculture in New
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we appreciate all that you
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
do I suspect as we get into the second
 
04:07:23.710 --> 04:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
year of our session we may be able to
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
start to schedule some of these field
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
trips and we'll uh we'll definitely take
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
you up on that because I know personally
 
04:07:30.510 --> 04:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'd love to go take a
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
tour okay so uh looks like uh
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has a question so
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you uh hi Rob last time
 
04:07:41.950 --> 04:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
we were talking which I think was preco
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that uh there was the
 
04:07:49.630 --> 04:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
the number of um fee for service
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities that were you conceivably
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
out there would be um challenging to
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
meet with the current with basically the
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
current capital and uh
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh set available and uh the
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
04:08:11.309 --> 04:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
um possibly having the the possibility
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
of more funding uh in the short term
 
04:08:15.309 --> 04:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
term might make it possible to have more
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
fee for service opportunities is that
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
still something that you're thinking
 
04:08:23.469 --> 04:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
about um yes it's a that's a great great
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
question so the lab has consistently
 
04:08:28.030 --> 04:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
grown over the years by fairly
 
04:08:30.189 --> 04:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
significant levels uh which is exciting
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's great there's there's more and more
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
people using the lab um the challenge is
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the funding from the the the state
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
maintains fairly level and so um the
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
subsidy that would help support a
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
growing lab hasn't really kept up with
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
the demand and
 
04:08:53.229 --> 04:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
so um what we have done to mitigate that
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
is invest in Automation and equipment to
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
make our our testing and everything more
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
efficient um but our staffing levels
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
have Fair really stayed the same and so
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
we've kind of reaching a bit of a
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
saturation point where the level of
 
04:09:09.309 --> 04:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
growth gets harder to do without more
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
Staffing um however um with with Co and
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
some other funding opportunities that
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
are coming from the farm bill um A
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
Renewed um push to get the lab um some
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
levels of accreditation and membership
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
into Animal Health lab networks we are
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
exploring ways to perhaps get better
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that might allow us to
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
build the capacity that we're trying to
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
do um we're also exploring more
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities with some grants and have
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
had some success there so we are working
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
towards um building our capacity um it's
 
04:09:44.590 --> 04:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
an ongoing discussion with the state um
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner um and probably
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
will come across your desk at some point
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
or other um that you know looking for
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
long-term stable funding for the
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab is is a an important
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
priority so um we are doing very well
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
and looking for ways to keep that
 
04:10:02.159 --> 04:10:04.750 align:start position:0%
and looking for ways to keep that
viability

04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
viability
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
going thank you uh representative
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you chair um so a couple
 
04:10:12.560 --> 04:10:13.870 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you chair um so a couple
questions

04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh Dr Gibson um I run a equin boarding
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
facility um close to the capital here
 
04:10:24.510 --> 04:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
and um in my travels learning more and
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
more what about agricultural check
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
stations to help with the biocurity that
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have in the state um through the
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic um we've also seen a lot of
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
people getting interactive with outdoor
 
04:10:39.109 --> 04:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
activities purchasing of animals
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
Trucking over the road we're seeing more
 
04:10:42.510 --> 04:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
and more animals come in from the
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
Midwest where
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
we have different types of things like
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
strangles and um equin influenza the
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
herpes outbreak for example that we had
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
down in Florida is there better ways
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
that you guys have been working on to
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
try and help protect the um livestock
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
animals that we have here in the state
 
04:11:05.109 --> 04:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
um and what would you suggest possibly
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
for us as a committee to help that so uh
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
excellent question the the concern of of
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
biocurity and the spread of disease
 
04:11:19.950 --> 04:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's happening that between livestock
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
ecoin this is a is a concern we are
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more rescue animals as
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
as you're all aware rescue horses rescue
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
cats and dogs that are coming to us from
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
all different parts of the country with
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
them are coming all sorts of diseases
 
04:11:34.830 --> 04:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
that are not from our region so we've
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
seen coides and a dog from Arizona
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that up here but
 
04:11:42.510 --> 04:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
they're from Arizona we saw you know
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
diptheria and a rescue horse that came
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
up from South Carolina we we see
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
diseases popping up in in these animals
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
all the time so there's the issue of the
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
challenge of rescue animals um many of
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
these diseases are not necessarily even
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
reportable so they wouldn't be screened
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
for or tested for so um there are
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory diseases that are required
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
for transport and Interstate movement
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
and and sale things like the ecoin
 
04:12:10.109 --> 04:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
Infectious anemia test we test 8,000
 
04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
horses a year for that test uh these
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
regulatory test are largely controlled
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
through the state veterinarians office
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
and through the state you know the
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
statutes that that restrict movement um
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
as a Diagnostic lab we don't have a lot
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
of um say in in what's the effective
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
measure to to help reduce those risks um
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
we are here to provide and communicate
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
with our state vet the moment we have uh
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
what appears to be an outbreak or a a
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation that could pose a threat to
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
other animals uh and so we do report
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
regularly as a lab we're required to
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
report reportable diseases and diseases
 
04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
of Public Health concern so we
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
communicate regularly with with Steve
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
Crawford's office but it would really be
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the State Vet
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
to um really decide if any um f future
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation was going to help them in
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
their role in safeguarding the Import
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
and Export of of animals but so I know
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
he would be be working with you closely
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
on any of those questions thank you
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Murray yep
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
question and um thank you so one of the
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions that I have um is what your
 
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
relationship is with tickborne illness
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
testing and the relationship of that
 
04:13:34.510 --> 04:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
between zoonotic um diseases and humans
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
and animals actually I guess and the
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
intersectionality that you might have
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
with DHHS or anything like that this is
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
an issue that is
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
of great concern in my constituency and
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious to hear what your role
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
is sure so you're correct Vector born
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
disease transmission is certainly a huge
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
concern in our region whether it be
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes or ticks um and we are uh
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
from the diagnostic standpoint looking
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
out for these these types of diseases um
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
ticks specifically um that has tended to
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
be a really specialized test um really
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
relegated to certain labs and so
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut was the lab kind of in our
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
region traditionally that would be
 
04:14:21.389 --> 04:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
working with tix I would say though that
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
there is some uh renewed interest and
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
and efforts underway um in a joint um
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
effort between Maine Vermont and New
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire us at un to enhance and create
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
um tick surveillance um and uh you know
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis of diseases Within These
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
ticks and so um that's a something that
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
has not been funded yet um it's it's in
 
04:14:47.229 --> 04:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
the white paper stage and where we
 
04:14:48.750 --> 04:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
through with Maine and Vermont are
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking for uh funding sources for that
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
so in the near future we may get more
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
involved um specifically with ticks but
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
we do um regularly diagnose the various
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
Vector born diseases and work closely
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the public health department um
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
that thank you I know uh from my own
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
personal experience I picked 20 of them
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
off my leg this morning from a short
 
04:15:15.429 --> 04:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
Excursion out behind the farm so there's
 
04:15:17.469 --> 04:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of them this year and I'm certain
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you're probably seeing a a
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
significant uptick no pun intended in
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of testing that you're
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
doing we are we we've been seeing we've
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
seen some livestock actually come in uh
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
deceased from uh overly burdened tick
 
04:15:33.309 --> 04:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
loads and they were basically just bled
 
04:15:35.309 --> 04:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
to death from from the levels of tick
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing these these ticks
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
migrating further and further north
 
04:15:40.269 --> 04:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
where they traditionally haven't been
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
affecting livestock as much so just the
 
04:15:42.600 --> 04:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
affecting livestock as much so just the
physical

04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
physical
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
bleeding that comes from the tick
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
feeding is actually causing really
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
significant pathology for for livestock
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
and so we were watching that closely too
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
I did you have something you wanted to
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
chime in yeah just just because it it is
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
such a new issue for the spring so uh
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
UNH extension we collaborate with um the
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
University of Massachusetts Amherst with
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
a program called tick report so over the
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
last couple of years we've provided
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for residents to go
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
through our portal and have their ticks
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
tested for um one of several um human
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
born uh pathogens like Lyme disease Etc
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
so um we've been doing it but to uh
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
Rob's point I think it would be great to
 
04:16:37.630 --> 04:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities thank you representative
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh for your your presentation today
 
04:16:49.710 --> 04:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
about the lab was ex really interesting
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
for me I'm interested to know H how how
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
is your fee structure developed I mean
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
is it you come up with uh uh what the
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
fees are for certain tests and
 
04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics to be done and uh just an
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
additional question too is when somebody
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
sends something to your lab how do you
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's uh the specimen or the
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
dead animal or part of the dead animal
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's sent to you is sent in a way that
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:17:25.349 --> 04:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
biocure right representative Aaron thank
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
you so a couple of of of questions there
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
um our our fee schedule is set by our
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
lab um in across the country some fee
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
schedules for veterinary diagnostic labs
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
are set by the legislature uh in New
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the public health lab for
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
example their fees are set by the
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislature um our lab traditionally has
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
set our own fees uh which does allow uh
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
more flexibility um to make any changes
 
04:17:58.349 --> 04:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
that are necessary um my view is that
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
having affordable pricing is part of
 
04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
diagnostic stewardship and so if a
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
client cannot afford the test that's a
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
detriment to their animal their
 
04:18:10.830 --> 04:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
livestock it's a potential detriment to
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health of of a disease that might
 
04:18:14.429 --> 04:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
threaten humans as well and so we need
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
to be make these tests affordable um but
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
we also um need to cover our expenses
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
and um um also not trying to undercut um
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
private sector so um we are you know we
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
do market analyses and cost assessments
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're not trying to make
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
profits on it we're just trying to
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
provide a service that's affordable to
 
04:18:39.920 --> 04:18:40.590 align:start position:0%
provide a service that's affordable to
our

04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
clients um
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
and your your your second part of the
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
question about biocurity for shipping of
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
specimens um we provide to our clients
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
um guidelines on how to properly package
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and ship specimens and we do a lot of
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
effort into really trying to educate
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
them on that um our own staff when we
 
04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
have to ship things out have to be
 
04:19:05.109 --> 04:19:05.119 align:start position:0%
specially trained and certified and so
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
we maintain staff members that are
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
trained um both for packaging carefully
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
but also labeling appropriately for all
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
the do and iata um um Aviation
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
regulations that are required for
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
packaging and shipping so we we we do as
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
much as we can to educate um and for the
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
most part we have a fairly good um uh
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
track record for having things arrive
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
safely um and uncompromised and
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
certainly when we receive the specimen
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
we do everything that we can do for
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
quality assurance and to maintain

specimen Integrity throughout the
 
04:19:37.080 --> 04:19:39.149 align:start position:0%
specimen Integrity throughout the
testing

04:19:39.149 --> 04:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
testing
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
process thank you appreciate that okay
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you director Gibson we
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate oh we have one more question
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative candidate go ahead thank
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
you chair uh one more quick question um
 
04:19:55.469 --> 04:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
in the past for competition um when we
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
have collected blood samples for drug
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
testing um I've been informed that your
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
lab is not something that handles that
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
typically it get sent out to Vermont is
 
04:20:06.269 --> 04:20:06.279 align:start position:0%
that something that your lab is
 
04:20:08.109 --> 04:20:08.119 align:start position:0%
interested in taking on at some point in
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
time or is that
 
04:20:09.520 --> 04:20:11.389 align:start position:0%
time or is that
something

04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
in so
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
again if you know if the need presents
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
and there there's a need for it in our
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
state we would certainly entertain and
 
04:20:23.469 --> 04:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
look at uh ways to offer that service um
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
again when it comes to drug testing that
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
sort of Toxicology is is a fairly
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
specialized test and so um not all Labs
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
will will offer that and it's fairly
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
expensive uh the type of equipment that
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
you need to to be able to do that and so
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
it would take a fairly large investment
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be ready to do that um but certainly
 
04:20:44.590 --> 04:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
if the demand was there we would um look
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
at possibilities to to do that thank
 
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you director Gibson we
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate it you've done a great job in
 
04:20:55.389 --> 04:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
your presentation and answering our
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions next we will go to uh Marian
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
McCord she is the senior Vice Prost for
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
research economic engagement and
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
Outreach thank you Mr chair I don't have
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
a set of slides but I just wanted to um
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
give a welcome to all of you um I am the
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
senior Vice Provost for research

economic engagement and Outreach and our
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
office oversees all of the sponsored
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
program activities on campus um as well
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
as uh extension Cooperative Extension
 
04:21:35.389 --> 04:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
professional development and training uh
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
external engagement in Outreach and uh
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
those programs managed by that unit
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
innovation commercialization and
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
Entrepreneurship um so it's a very large
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
unit and it's very outwardly focused um
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
so really looking at um as our mission
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
translating the uh research of the
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
university to make a social and economic
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
impact in New Hampshire so uh we're very
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
excited to uh be with you today uh Ken
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
La valy is vice proost in my unit and
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
he'll be talking to you a little bit
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
about um Cooperative Extension in a few
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
moments uh UNH is your state Flagship
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
University we're an R1 uh research
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
intensive University uh there are only
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh 130 R1 Institutes of higher education
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the United States so it's a pretty
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
Elite group um and that means that um
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
the the federal and state investments in
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
the the research work that we do um can
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
give really great benefit to the state
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I've listened with great interest to
 
04:22:50.830 --> 04:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
the conversation and the questions um
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
I've been working with uh Rob Gibson and
 
04:22:57.950 --> 04:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh Christine Bean at uh New Hampshire
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS to put together a team to do an
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
assessment of our uh surveillance
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
capacity in the State uh so we're
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
looking at um what kinds of capacity we
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
have to look for uh human animal uh
 
04:23:18.990 --> 04:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
environmental toxins and and pathogens
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh as well as plants and um we're hoping
 
04:23:26.910 --> 04:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
that by pulling together uh a network we
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
can build a Consortium that will uh give
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
better access to uh New Hampshire
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
residents to the expertise that we have
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
here uh in our combin through our
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
combined resources uh and will serve as
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
a a really a center of excellence uh for
 
04:23:48.269 --> 04:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
surveillance and for resilience for the
 
04:23:52.109 --> 04:23:52.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um I arrived in
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in February of
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
2020 with a a goal of of increasing our
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
research capacity here uh at UNH and uh
 
04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
short weeks later my first official Act
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
was shedding down research operations
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
due to the covid uh pandemic uh and then
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
then re starting them again um one of my
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
biggest jobs has been to uh build a
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
covid testing program from the ground up
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we we don't have a college
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
of veterinary medicine or a public
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
health program or a a school of medicine
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
at UNH but we have a genome Center uh we
 
04:24:37.109 --> 04:24:37.119 align:start position:0%
have great expertise at the vet
 
04:24:40.030 --> 04:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab and in our other units
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
and by marshalling uh that Talent at you
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
we were able to stand up a covid Testing
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
Lab within 100 days from scratch and uh
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
tested about 4,000 people on our first
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
day of opening and so far we've tested
 
04:24:55.239 --> 04:24:56.590 align:start position:0%
day of opening and so far we've tested
over

04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
600,000 uh We've run over 600,000 tests
 
04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we've been working with DHHS to
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
test uh jails uh school um I'm sorry
 
04:25:10.269 --> 04:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
jails uh homeless shelters and long-term
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
care facilities for the state uh and
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
we're also now engaged in um in a a
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
state program for testing for camps and
 
04:25:22.349 --> 04:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh Public Schools so we are really
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
trying to um extend the resources that
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
we have developed here uh to to U make
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
them available throughout New Hampshire
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
um so uh we are uh as a land grant
 
04:25:38.030 --> 04:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
University you know again our our
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
mission is um to serve serve the public
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we're really excited to be making
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
an impact here in New Hampshire and uh
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions that
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%

appreciate the update You' provided I
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize that uh your work
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
existed at the college so thank you it's
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
new that was a great thing for me to
 
04:26:05.790 --> 04:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
learn um representative Murray did you
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
question I I did just generally speaking
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
but I I first wanted to say thank you
 
04:26:14.189 --> 04:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
for all of the dedicated work I mean
 
04:26:16.269 --> 04:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
setting something like that up in a 100
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
days is commendable and so our committee
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
thanks you for that but I did also just
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
want to ask if um the slide Decks that

we have been presented to U Mr chair
 
04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
digitally I think we lost you there at
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
the end but I think you're asking for

04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
and and I hope to keep it as brief as
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
possible let's see here you think I'd be
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
an expert at doing this at this point
 
04:27:42.560 --> 04:27:46.950 align:start position:0%
an expert at doing this at this point
from

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
beginning all right so I I fundamentally
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give for the new folks on
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
the environment nag committee um some
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
idea of who we are as UNH extension what
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
we do and then just a little bit of our
 
04:28:02.189 --> 04:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
response to
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 so who are we um we have
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
extension offices in all of the 10
 
04:28:11.550 --> 04:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
counties we have professional education
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
campuses is in Manchester and Portsmouth
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
and one at UNH Manchester and I'll dig
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
in a little bit more about this in a in
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
a moment um UNH extension is about 150
 
04:28:27.109 --> 04:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
people strong um it's very important
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we have more people in the field
 
04:28:32.550 --> 04:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
than we do in administration and then we
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
do in Durham um so you can see here that
 
04:28:37.469 --> 04:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
we have about
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
63% um of folks that are helping with
 
04:28:43.389 --> 04:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
getting information out to communities
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
and with that I want to mention that we
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
I have two new phenomenal colleagues in
 
04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
addition to Rob with Anton and Anthony
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
Davis I I think they truly appreciate
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
the uniqueness of the State of New
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and both genuinely want to
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
make a difference um to the A and
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
natural resource businesses and
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
communities around the state you may not
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
realize but Cooperative Extension
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
engages more than
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
150,000 residents per year in
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
face-to-face programs we learned very
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
quickly um through covid that we had
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
many millions over the last year
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
engaging in our online newly developed
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
content um from a return on investment
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
which is very important to me and to our
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization so the county contributes
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
about $2.9 million to Cooperative
 
04:29:42.269 --> 04:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
Extension um the state through through
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
the usnh appropriation contributes about
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
7.6 million it's important to note that
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh the return on investment is high and
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
our extension
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
professionals um bring in an additional
 
04:29:55.760 --> 04:29:57.309 align:start position:0%
professionals um bring in an additional
$7.7

04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
$7.7
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
million um to leverage the county and
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
state contributions and this is
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
important because it truly allows us um
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
to be the size that we
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
are so I wanted to just briefly go over
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
our um five key program areas um
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
obviously food and agriculture is a very
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
important piece of what we do in
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
extension generally we want to provide
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
support to fruit and vegetable Dairy
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
livestock and ornamental Horticulture
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
Industries food safety for schools
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants and food producers and
 
04:30:35.550 --> 04:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
practical advice for the home
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
Gardener it's also important that we
 
04:30:40.269 --> 04:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
have safe and local food production and
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
smallscale agriculture continue to be
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
very high priorities for us in
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
particular we also provide soil testing
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
Plant Pathology and business planning it
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
was important during covid that we
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
maintained our ability to get out on the
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
sites work with the farms and make sure
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
we were doing the soil testing and plant
 
04:31:01.600 --> 04:31:02.910 align:start position:0%
we were doing the soil testing and plant
disease

04:31:02.910 --> 04:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:31:07.630 --> 04:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
diagnostic um needs so that uh we didn't
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
just leave in the face of covid um
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
another area that you might not be
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with is our ask UNH extension
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
so we have an 866 number 866 EXT grow we
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
have an online portal through ask UNH
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
extension and we also have a home
 
04:31:29.109 --> 04:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
gardening podcast it's really funny the
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
home gardening podcast we just built out
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
during covid and we already have over
 
04:31:33.880 --> 04:31:35.189 align:start position:0%
during covid and we already have over
4,000

04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
4,000
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
subscribers and it actually ranks in the
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
top five of all podcasts focused on home
 
04:31:42.269 --> 04:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
gardening which was really surprising
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
ing um ask un is an important online um
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%

Fields about 9,000 calls a year and that
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
is run by trained volunteers with expert
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
um content
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
reviewers you might have seen us on
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
Channel 11 with the grow at Green
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
segment that has also been an important
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
way for us to bring the intellectual
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
resources of the University out to
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
communities our natural resource program
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
area is also uh important we work
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
closely with our many state and federal
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%

04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
with the Lakes slay monitoring program
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
which is a partnership between the
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%

hire um we work with State Partners also
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%

as those needs have evolved we've
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
increased our capacity to deliver
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%

also community and economic
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
development I'm very very excited to let
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
you all know that the uh University of
 
04:34:12.510 --> 04:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire really does see the 4
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
program as its golden uh positive youth
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
development program and for the last I
 
04:34:22.750 --> 04:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
think four years now we've provided a 4
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
merit scholarship this merit scholarship
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
is outstanding so every year from second
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
grade through graduating senior that an
 
04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
individual is actively involved in 4 and
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%

science volunteers are our lifeblood and
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
in spite of covid or despite covid we
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
had over 4,000 volunteers this past year
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
reach an additional 53 53,000
 
04:36:38.189 --> 04:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state over 14
 
04:36:41.310 --> 04:36:41.320 align:start position:0%

time

04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
is more than just a number at 4.17
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
million they really are additional arms
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
out into communities bringing the
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%

04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
towns um I want to provide in a couple
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
of examples of some of the programs we
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
do that I think relate to the
 
04:37:08.830 --> 04:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
environment in a interest um so we have
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
a citizen Science Program citizen
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
science has has been um a growing area
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
of volunteerism for at least the last
 
04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
decade and we have a very healthy
 
04:37:22.269 --> 04:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
program at the University of New
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one particular program is the
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
natural resource program that hosts a
 
04:37:29.709 --> 04:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire invasives Academy this is
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
a five-week course we adapted it to 100%
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
online we had 105 applicants for 40s
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
bases I'm really really excited to say
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Von blinsky
 
04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
participated in our spring cohort and uh
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
after which he's already launched um
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
several garlic mustard volunteer days in
 
04:37:52.320 --> 04:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
several garlic mustard volunteer days in
Keen

04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
Keen
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
um additionally we had over 3,000
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
volunteers trained in covid safety
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
practices so despite um covid people
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
still wanted to find ways to volunteer
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
um in volunteer natural stewardship
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
programs so we educated them in safe
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
ways to do that following CDC guidance
 
04:38:18.269 --> 04:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
and state
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
Guidance the final project I want to
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
bring up is called nature groupies now
 
04:38:26.349 --> 04:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
nature groupies is a way to empower
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
multiple generations of outdoor
 
04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts to volunteer again focused
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
on natural resource
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
stewardship um this is a phenomenal
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
program that really works with over 200
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
conservation organizations
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
and provides a One-Stop portal for an
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
individual who is interested in
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
volunteering um on a land care
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
environmental purpose um through a
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
network portal um this is a has been
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly successful again 200
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
different organizations are populating a
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
calendar that you can search based on
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
interest areas um and we're excited to
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
say that this is continuing to grow our
 
04:39:16.750 --> 04:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
goal is to have over 20,000 volunteers
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
use this portal in the next five
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
years an example from our forest
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
industry so we support a $ 1.6 billion
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
direct impact um 7,000 jobs in the state
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in Forest
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
industry um particularly when we think
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
about Forest industry support we are
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
helping with
 
04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
um how to
 
04:39:48.190 --> 04:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
diversify um what to do with uh low
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
value Pine for
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
example um and figure out ways to uh
 
04:39:55.440 --> 04:39:56.590 align:start position:0%
example um and figure out ways to uh
encourage

04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
04:40:00.190 --> 04:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship in the low value wood
 
04:40:04.510 --> 04:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
Market as well as train um and keep
 
04:40:08.190 --> 04:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
licensed our commercial
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
Foresters I'll end by just giving a
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
couple overviews of the things I'm most
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
proud of that we've done during
 
04:40:18.270 --> 04:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
co uh so we produced a farm products map
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think you all heard at the beginning
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
of covid that um there were rotting
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
produce and spoiling milk because there
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
were no place to bring it so we wanted
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
to connect the people producing the food
 
04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
to the people that needed the food in
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
particular those who are food in Secure
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
we did the same thing with a local
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
seafood F finder um oysters you may not
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
know but their value is based on their
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
size and the most valuable oyster is
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
about two and a half inches so anything
 
04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
more than that they start to lose value
 
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
so oyster Growers all of a sudden were
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation where they needed to sell
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
their product or they were going to lose
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
a great deal of
 
04:41:03.070 --> 04:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue so what are we going to do
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
looking ahead we know that many people
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
have accessed our resources online but
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
first and foremost we a relationship
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
based in-person
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
program over the next few over the next
 
04:41:19.030 --> 04:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
year we're going to continue to focus on
 
04:41:21.550 --> 04:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
helping communities Ag and natural
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
resource businesses recover from
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 we're going to continue to
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
build relationships with youth through
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
our 4 program and we're going to expand
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
our mental health healthy living and
 
04:41:34.878 --> 04:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
our mental health healthy living and
opioid

04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
programs thank you and I will take any
 
04:41:43.230 --> 04:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much director Lali
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's great presentation I personally
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
am familiar with the services that
 
04:41:54.190 --> 04:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
extension provides and has U George
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hamilton actually uh retired he has not
 
04:42:02.670 --> 04:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
retired retiring the end of
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
June and we're all um holding our breath
 
04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
because maybe he'll change his mind yeah
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
I know he's been threatening it for
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
quite a few years it'll be a huge
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
resource that the a community will lose
 
04:42:17.190 --> 04:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
now you are absolutely correct and that
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
is a high priority position to replace
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
in our Hillsboro County Office certainly
 
04:42:25.948 --> 04:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
we certainly won't replace him either
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
that will be a big shoes to Phil for
 
04:42:29.948 --> 04:42:29.958 align:start position:0%
anyone who tries but we certainly
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate George and all the years of

04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
to school
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
me so again I'm Stacy Pura with the New
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm to school program uh New
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm to school is a program at
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
unh's sustainability Institute it's been
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
2003 um I wanted to give you a little
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
bit of information about um what's
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
happening with schools across the state
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
on the local food procurement end of
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
things um some of this data is my own
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
that I've collected and some of the data
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
is from the USDA they do a a farm to
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
school census across the country every
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
few years uh the figures I have there
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
are a little bit old they're supposed to
 
04:44:03.150 --> 04:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
be releasing new data this spring so uh
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of these numbers will
 
04:44:08.948 --> 04:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
increase um so you can see on the right
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
the bar graph showing
 
04:44:13.868 --> 04:44:13.878 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of dollars that schools
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
are spending on local food um some of
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's increasing like schools that are
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
purchasing nothing has gone down which
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
is great we want to see that um and and
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
some purchases um are going up into the
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
higher end but again this is still a
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
little bit old and we're not even going
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
to count this past school year because
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
it was uh really tough for schools to to
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
purchase from farm so so um and then
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
according to the USDA that is the
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
percentag is there that 77% of schools
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
participate somehow in farm to school
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
schools are purchasing $840,000 worth of
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire food um 70% of school
 
04:45:01.948 --> 04:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
districts have a school garden and then
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
you can see the the top local food
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
purchases by schools so these are all
 
04:45:10.190 --> 04:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire products um apples being
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
the favorite and and and easiest to
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
acquire and easiest to
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
serve um so we have a couple of other
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
programs uh that help support uh Farm
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing one is called New Hampshire
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
Harvest of the month so it's a year-long
 
04:45:30.990 --> 04:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
seasonal calendar of of foods that are
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
grown in New Hampshire that schools can
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
acquire the program comes with classroom
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
activities geared toward elementary
 
04:45:40.030 --> 04:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
schools it has school lunch friendly
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
recipes assoc iated with it um it's been
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
adopted by a lot of schools across the
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
state if you ever look at a school lunch
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
menu you might see these images there or
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
these Foods on the school lunch menu uh
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
so this month is mixed greens uh you may
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
see that on hopefully because they'll be
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
serving salads um on the menus we also
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh have a couple of Distributors that
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
are using it to promote um the foods to
 
04:46:13.708 --> 04:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
two schools they sell like native Maine
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh uses it because they have a lot of
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
school customers in New Hampshire food
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
connects in Vermont uh which is a food
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hub but they also have New Hampshire
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
customers so they use it as a
 
04:46:24.280 --> 04:46:25.350 align:start position:0%
customers so they use it as a
promotional

04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
promotional
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
tool um so it's pretty easy for schools
 
04:46:31.628 --> 04:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
this we also just last year finished up
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
an indigenous New Hampshire Harvest
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
calendar so it's a Four Season calendar
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
of foods that the abanaki people who
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
have lived and still live here would
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
have eaten um it's not necessarily meant
 
04:46:51.628 --> 04:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
uh for schools to be able to go buy
 
04:46:53.708 --> 04:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
these Foods because they can't they're
 
04:46:57.070 --> 04:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
not commercially available um but it's
 
04:47:01.150 --> 04:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
more of a classroom um program uh to
 
04:47:04.190 --> 04:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
educate schools about uh the indigenous
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
people that that lived here and still
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
live here so you can see all the
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
different foods that are featured um um
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
some of them they certainly could get
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
like blueberries and and maple syrup and
 
04:47:18.548 --> 04:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
cranberries and squash um so there's
 
04:47:20.430 --> 04:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
recipes associated with it again
 
04:47:20.440 --> 04:47:21.548 align:start position:0%
recipes associated with it again
classroom

04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
activities seasonal posters of all of
 
04:47:24.160 --> 04:47:27.548 align:start position:0%
activities seasonal posters of all of
the

04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
foods another project we're working on
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
right now is a local vegetable
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
processing project uh we receive some
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
grant funding to start this um schools
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
and institutions use lately processed
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
vegetables all the time it's a labor
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
saving product um they can just buy it
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
and use it they don't have to chop it up
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
wash it whatever it's just ready to go
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
so uh this is uh about trying to uh use
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
local products for that market uh so we
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
have this pilot project happening with a
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
farmer in The Lakes Region who is
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
supplying the carrots genuine local
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
which is a commercial kitchen in
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
Meredith that is making the carrot
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
sticks or right now carrot sticks and
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to move on to shredded
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
carrots and sliced carrots um the billup
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
food shed which is the purchasing
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
platform and the conquered school
 
04:48:29.070 --> 04:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
district is is the buyer and so it's a
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
pilot project and we're we're trying to
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
work out what's going to work best what
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
are what's the price points that are
 
04:48:39.270 --> 04:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to work best and hopefully expand
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
the offerings um and expand uh this
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to other schools um in the
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
state so uh the next product up will be
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
a tomato sauce so we have to wait for
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.750 --> 04:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
that so we also have a state uh Farm to
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
school network and we're working on a
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
farm to school reimbursement bill for
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the state so basically asking the state
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
to fund this reimbursement Bill uh
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
meaning that for every three federal
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
dollars that a school spends on New
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grown food they would get a
 
04:49:22.590 --> 04:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
dollar back from the state up to $1,200
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
per school so it's
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
really an investment in New Hampshire
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and an incentive for schools
 
04:49:36.150 --> 04:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.430 --> 04:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
Foods and then a couple of other things
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are happening um the national
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
Center for appropriate technology along
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
with the national Farm to school network
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh have developed a a a training um it's
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
a train the trainer program um around
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
teaching people how to sell to the
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
school Market uh so this is going to
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
start later in the year um there's going
 
04:50:05.230 --> 04:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
to be one in the Northeast the enat
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
Northeast office is in Kean New
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and they participated in
 
04:50:11.708 --> 04:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
putting this program together together
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
so um I hope to attend uh we hope that I
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
think someone from extension is going to
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
attend someone from the Department of Ed
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from the Department of egg
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
will go to this
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
training um and learn about the school
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
Market bring the program back and offer
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
some training to New Hampshire Farmers
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
on all about the school
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
market and uh the USDA Farm School grant
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
program um which has been around since I
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
think 2012
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we have three proposals from New
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this year that would support
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
um actually this incat training uh that
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed submitted so we
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
would be able to send people to the
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
training and then be able to support um
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
the training back in the state as well
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
as provide some stipend for Farmers to
 
04:51:02.910 --> 04:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
participate in the
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
training um but since uh the Inception
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the grant program we've had
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
$500,000 come into the state to various
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
school districts and other entities that
 
04:51:15.868 --> 04:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
have uh applied for the
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
grant um and then I also wanted just to
 
04:51:21.390 --> 04:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
make you aware of the this is at the
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
federal level the Child Nutrition
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
reauthorization bill which is the bill
 
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
that funds the national school lunch
 
04:51:31.150 --> 04:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
program it has to get reauthorized every
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
five years and this is one of those
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
years and so these are some of the
 
04:51:37.788 --> 04:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
marker bills um that may or may not end
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
up in it but any of these would help
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
further support uh Farm to school in the
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%

presentation I'm interested to know um
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
how how many schools in New Hampshire
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
have access to uh green houses uh I I
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
know in my area we have um VI school
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
they have a a small garden out front um
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
and other schools are doing you know
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
other grow
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
programs but um I'm interested to know
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
if there are any schools that have
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
access to green houses um and and how do
 
04:52:41.548 --> 04:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
they How do they go about funding those
 
04:52:41.558 --> 04:52:42.590 align:start position:0%
they How do they go about funding those
as

04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:52:45.070 --> 04:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's that is a good question
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
exactly how many schools have access to
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
green houses but I know uh some do uh
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
the newest one I think is in Pittsburgh
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
School District so way up there uh they
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
have a new Greenhouse um there's some in
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region and on the Sea Coast um
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there are some and they've all been
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
funded in in different different ways
 
04:53:09.548 --> 04:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
the communities and the schools that
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it may have done
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
fundraisers for it um they might have I
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
know a school in The Lakes Region uh
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
that uses uh Title One money for their
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
Farm to school program and they just put
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
up a greenhouse with the help of
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
extension um so there are there are some
 
04:53:30.190 --> 04:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
I would say there are more just School
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
Gardens across the state than there are
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
green houses for those schools um and
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
again funding is in different ways they
 
04:53:40.548 --> 04:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
could have funded it through grants or
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
or fundraising those are kind of
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
inexpensive um things to do followup
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh also in addition I'm
 
04:53:51.390 --> 04:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
interested to
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
know to what extent any
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
corporations uh donate uh time materials
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
money whatever like ague or um Tractor
 
04:54:05.310 --> 04:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
Supply or you know any of these other
 
04:54:07.708 --> 04:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
companies that that deal with
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural um products
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I think so the ones that I'm aware of
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm not so familiar with egue or
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
Tractor Supply but I know like Lowe's
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and Home Depot they have programs where
 
04:54:24.190 --> 04:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
schools have gotten funding uh for
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
supplies for garden programs so like up
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
to $5,000 you can get all you need to
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
put in school Gardens and
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
more but I'm not as familiar with those
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%

curious about the um intersectionality
 
04:54:52.708 --> 04:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education and
 
04:54:54.510 --> 04:54:54.520 align:start position:0%

04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
that um somewhere um and and can you
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
bit so uh the the Department of
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
Education I worked with the nutrition
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%

lunch program um and they are the
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
department is very Farm to school

04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
we work with both Statewide
 
04:56:46.750 --> 04:56:46.760 align:start position:0%

04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
Farmers like extension as well as more
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
Regional organizations to try to connect
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
all of the groups um that are working to
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen the New Hampshire food system
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire um our Network
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
leadership team is the group of people
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
that provide strategic Direction um for
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
our Network and you can see again here
 
04:57:09.470 --> 04:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
we've got Heidi Barker from UNH
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%

Community Loan Fund again we have a
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
breadth of leaders that are helping to
 
04:57:20.190 --> 04:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
kind of keep an eye on what's Happening
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
across the food system and figure out
 
04:57:25.270 --> 04:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
how we can collaborate um again to help
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
strengthen um strengthen our food system
 
04:57:32.670 --> 04:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
so again our main focus is on connecting
 
04:57:36.030 --> 04:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
all of these groups um across the state
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
and um to make sure that we are learning
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
together and figuring out ways that we
 
04:57:43.868 --> 04:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
can work better together and we focus on
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
these six um these six areas increasing
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
Farmland conservation and access
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%

04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
climate change and then promoting racial
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
equity in our food system and again
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
these are areas that our Network
 
04:58:08.350 --> 04:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
Partners have said are important to them
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
and these are the areas that they want
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
to collaborate um to collaborate in so
 
04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you some examples of
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative initiatives that have come
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
out of our work together um I don't know
 
04:58:21.548 --> 04:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
if any of you have heard about the New
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire feeding New Hampshire project
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
this developed just last spring and
 
04:58:28.350 --> 04:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
formed as a result of our weekly
 
04:58:30.548 --> 04:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
meetings that we started organizing when
 
04:58:32.830 --> 04:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
everything shut down because of covid we
 
04:58:34.750 --> 04:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
were organizing weekly and then
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly calls with our Network
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
Partners who are trying to figure out
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
how do we a support a lot of people who'
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
have now lost their jobs and are facing
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
food insecurity and also a lot of our
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
local producers that were having to
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to quickly pivot and
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
find new markets and new customers and
 
04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
so we work together with the New
 
04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Food Bank the Farm Bureau and
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
also noan New Hampshire to start this
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
program um that essentially delivered um
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh money into the hands of our New
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire producers um by giving food
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
pantries the ability to purchase
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
directly from our local
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
Growers um this program is continuing
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and is continuing to grow um this summer
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be um there's going to be
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
$200,000 allocated to New Hampshire Food
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
Bank pant pantries to purchase local
 
04:59:27.510 --> 04:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
produce um another project that
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
developed this last year and was the
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
result of a um USDA specialty crop blant
 
04:59:37.548 --> 04:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
crop block grant um was the development
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
of a New Hampshire food Hub Network so
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
again um we have a growing number of
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
food hubs across the state which are um
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
groups that are helping to aggregate
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
local products and deliver them directly
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
to to customers or
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
institutions and one of the the issues
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
or barriers to Growing this market for
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
local food has been the ability to reach
 
05:00:03.230 --> 05:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state and so the
 
05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
network is now working together to
 
05:00:09.548 --> 05:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
connect these local food hubs as well as
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
other participating Farms so that they
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
can distribute products together and
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
save Transportation costs they can
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
Aggregate and reach um larger wholesale
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
markets um they're learning together and
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
sharing best practices um so this is
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
another you know really exciting um
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
project that we developed just this last
 
05:00:32.190 --> 05:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
year that we are continuing to help um
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
find funding for in the coming year um
 
05:00:38.110 --> 05:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
the other one of the other uh things
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we do is we help to um we actually
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
do now coordinate the New Hampshire E
 
05:00:46.270 --> 05:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
Local month activities um and we have
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
turned that over the last couple of
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
years into sort of a yearlong effort to
 
05:00:53.230 --> 05:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
try to get the word out and communicate
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
and educate consumers across New
 
05:00:56.708 --> 05:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about the value of eating
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
locally in our state um so stay tuned
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
for more information because August is
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire eat local month but as I
 
05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
say we're trying to get the word out
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
that every month should be E Local month
 
05:01:10.270 --> 05:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
um another example of of a collaboration
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
that came out of you know the
 
05:01:16.030 --> 05:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
relationships that are built through our
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
network is the New Hampshire farm future
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
fund um it's currently housed in the
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
chesher County Conservation District but
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
essentially these are grants this is
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
philanthropically funded at this point
 
05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
um grants to land trust to work with
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
land owners on Farm viability planning
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
and conservation easements so often
 
05:01:40.030 --> 05:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
times um in order to to conserve Farm
 
05:01:43.230 --> 05:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
land um farmers and land owners need
 
05:01:45.868 --> 05:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
assistance to think about how can they
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
um continue their their Farm operation
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
into the future so this couples um
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and business
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
planning um because we've talked so much
 
05:01:59.070 --> 05:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
about research I thought I'd also just
 
05:02:01.708 --> 05:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
um mention that we also the New
 
05:02:03.628 --> 05:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Food Alliance applied and
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
received a core um Grant from the
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire so this is a
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
a grant to encourage collaborative
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
research um amongst faculty members and
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
also to connect research that's
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
happening at the University with needs
 
05:02:22.270 --> 05:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
um in the community and so um our the
 
05:02:23.910 --> 05:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
the topic was the food and climate
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
research Network so we're bringing
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
together researchers across the
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
university who are interested in climate
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
and Food Systems and how do we create a
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
resilient reliable food system here in
 
05:02:34.400 --> 05:02:35.110 align:start position:0%
resilient reliable food system here in
New

05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and the last um the last
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
example of of um collaborative work that
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing that I wanted to share is um
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
is also to let you know that we're also
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about collaborating and
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about the resilience and
 
05:02:51.150 --> 05:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
reliability of our food system not just
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
within the boundaries of New Hampshire
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
but working together with other states
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
in New England so again we're part of a
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
three-year USDA Regional Food Systems
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
partnership planning Grant with other
 
05:03:04.590 --> 05:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide food system networks that you
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
can see here across the six New England
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
states and we work with Food Solutions
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
New England as well
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
um to try to figure out how can by 2030
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
we produce um that we consume 30% um of
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
the food grown in New England um is
 
05:03:24.030 --> 05:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
grown in New England sorry that 30% of
 
05:03:25.470 --> 05:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
the food consumed in New England is
 
05:03:28.548 --> 05:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
grown in New England by 2030 so over the
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
next few years um this grant will enable
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
us to think about setting benchmarks and
 
05:03:34.628 --> 05:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
working together across New England
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
states um to really ramp up that local
 
05:03:36.958 --> 05:03:38.030 align:start position:0%
states um to really ramp up that local
food

05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
food
 
05:03:40.390 --> 05:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
production um and finally finally just
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
to say how do people participate we have
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
an annual Statewide Gathering an annual
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
um strategy Retreat we have monthly
 
05:03:50.590 --> 05:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
Network cafes we were talking earlier
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
about meat processing that was the focus
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
Elena was at our um was one of the
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
presenters at our Network Cafe to talk
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
about meat processing in April um and
 
05:04:03.510 --> 05:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it's during these conversations that
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
again a lot of this collaborative um
 
05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
effort is is catalyzed and initiated so
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%

connected with a lot of different groups
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we in the agriculture work with do
 
05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
