00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everybody
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
still just trying to get organized um
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
before we get started i just with our
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
work session i just wanted to mention
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
why i called it uh these bills we did
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
here on the late side
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i did know that there were a few of
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors interested in
 
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.230 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors interested in
providing

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
some amendments
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
um based on what we heard at our public
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i figured we'll take a few minutes
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
and at least go over them for technical
 
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
and at least go over them for technical
issues

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
if we agree that they are at least okay
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
to move i think we should probably still
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
debate the bills in our executive
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
session again this is just an
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about these
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
prior to in case uh we might need in
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
case we need another amendment uh or
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
well i shouldn't be too busy today i
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think
 
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think
um

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i i picked these three i did mention
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
it with our ranking member if he hadn't
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
he wanted to add to the list and this is
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
the only three that rose to the level
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that being said
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
i will open the work session on
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
we'll start with
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
1447 which is
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
prohibiting state agencies from using
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
face recognition technology
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have any amendments to it i
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
looked at the language a few times i
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
think i'm okay with it i don't see
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
think i'm okay with it i don't see
anything

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
technically wrong with it that needs to
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
be corrected by amendment i think we can
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
in my opinion debate this one way or the
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
other in executive session does anybody
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
the intention here is is good but i do
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to dig a little deeper
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
into it and i'm not sure we have that
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
information or if we were provided with
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
anything that could allow us to do that
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.670 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
so

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying i disagree with you and i
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
did not did not receive anything from
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor in terms of amendment
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
since the hearing yeah so we can i think
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much discuss that in executive
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
session thank you okay
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else on 1447
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move that one aside
 
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.949 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move that one aside
sorry

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this is representative
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
fellows and i'm on the edna committee
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to share with you that
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
my committee had a bill that was had
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
this in it but was also more extensive
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of it addressed like
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
how law enforcement
 
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
how law enforcement
could

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
how law enforcement might under some
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances have access to that and
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
also we heard issues about
 
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
also we heard issues about
how

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement sometimes need to
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
work with federal law enforcement and
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
then they have
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
their own rules related to this and so
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
just to share with you we we had several
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we had two amendments sub
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
two amendments proposed
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
and um then it all died due to covid
 
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.189 align:start position:0%
and um then it all died due to covid
so

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
just to say it's a complicated issue and
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
you might need to
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
consider doing more work on this
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh and again we'll
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
talk about the merits of the bill one
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
way or the other when we get to
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
executive session again for this work
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
session i'm just trying to look to see
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
if all our ducks in a row before we get
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
to that point
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh 1447 i think we're good on
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay let's go to the next one i know has
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment and i did pass this out to
 
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.949 align:start position:0%
an amendment and i did pass this out to
everybody

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh we'll start with 1401
 
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
uh we'll start with 1401
and

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
if representative amman would like to
 
00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
if representative amman would like to
explain

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
just for its merits again we're going to
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to explain
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment mr chair
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
the original bill is very simple and
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment is also very simple
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
remember the recall the the intent of
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is to
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
shield new hampshire citizens from
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
the potential for federal mileage tax
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
which would be a new form of taxation
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a far-fetched idea the 1.2
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
trillion dollar infrastructure bill that
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
was passed contains a pilot program
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
for such a nationwide mileage tax
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is also not to
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
disrupt any current business of the
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
state or
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
other interested parties but to
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
merely shield new hampshire citizens
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
from this new tax
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the language in in uh i don't know if
 
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
the language in in uh i don't know if
you're

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
is your sheet color coded
 
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
is your sheet color coded
okay

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and that you see green and blue both so
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
the language in yellow was submitted by
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
a company called carfax before the
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
original public hearing you should have
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
all received an email with that language
 
00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
all received an email with that language
so

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
that language would narrow
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
the bill just to
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
third party public
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
authorities charged with enforcing motor
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle tax law
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
and then there was a question during the
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing i believe from
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
how does it affect
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
people that lease or rent a vehicle so
 
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
people that lease or rent a vehicle so
that

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
that language in green or blue is uh to
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
so happy to take any questions
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
no thank you for that um it seems pretty
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
straightforward and the only reason
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
again we're doing this is because i know
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
there were many issues brought up with
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
the original language
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
um that being said
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
the department of motor vehicles has
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
seen this amendment
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i know there were a lot of issues
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
title bureau as well
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
is do you have any early opinions on
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's it does it satisfy any of the
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
good morning um i am just reviewing this
 
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.590 align:start position:0%
good morning um i am just reviewing this
um

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
so far i was just going to go in and
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
compare it to how the current the
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
statute reads and where this will fall
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
i reading this
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't see a problem okay
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
and george have anything i mean
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative psych sorry
 
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
representative psych sorry
well

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
so my question might be it's actually
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that dmv is the right
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
person to ask but
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
i wonder um
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
this new
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
language of with with third-party public
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
authorities charged with enforcing motor
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle law motor vehicle tax law
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the vehicle's
 
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the vehicle's
owner

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we hear from someone who is
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting taxes to see
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
how they
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
would view that because it sounds to me
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
like well i don't want to debate it now
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
but that's i just wonder if
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
it raises as many questions
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
as it tries to answer
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
yeah no
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
fair enough and again i'm not trying to
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
force any issues here i'm just giving
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
these prime sponsors an opportunity to
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
modify this with the short amount of
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
time we have
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
yep representative i guess i have a
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
question just if either you can clarify
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
it or someone else um
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
there was concerns about the truth and
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
mileage act
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um being able to
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that odometers are not tampered
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
with that kind of thing is there i don't
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
know if this addresses any of those
 
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.029 align:start position:0%
know if this addresses any of those
issues

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
it attempts to with the with that
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
highlighted language with third-party
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
public authorities i mean i i think we
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
can all understand what the prime
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor's trying to do with this is just
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
put up a firewall from any additional
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
taxes coming from the federal government
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's prohibiting that that's causing
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
issues with other things okay that line
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
attempts to do it um i guess that's what
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
we do here today to see if it
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that or not and that's why
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm doing this now to see what the
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
opinions are with all the stakeholders
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else on this and we can
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
further discuss this at our executive
 
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.110 align:start position:0%
further discuss this at our executive
session

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk with the prime sponsor in
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
a moment
on

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
what to do next
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you just wanted to point out uh
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
the language doesn't prohibit
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
an authority to tax a vehicle
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
it just does so
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
on the basis of mileage
 
00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
on the basis of mileage
so

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
if you can tax a vehicle without needing
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
the mileage information you can still do
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know the way towns and
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
cities do it so thank you
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
all right we'll chat in a few minutes uh
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
because if we're gonna if you would like
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the committee to entertain this
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll have to get to ols and
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
and get an official draft
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh last one i put on the work session uh
 
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.230 align:start position:0%
uh last one i put on the work session uh
is

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh so and thank you for setting up the
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
conversation with deputy director mike
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
todd of the registry motor vehicles um
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
in discussing with him he explained some
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
issues that the registry saw with the
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the biggest ones was they
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
have no infrastructure for sending out
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
fines apparently fines by mail is not a
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
thing that anyone except the easy pass
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
people really do
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and so their primary way of issuing
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
citations or fines is
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
an in-person interaction with a police
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
officer at a traffic stop or something
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
else similar to that
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does is that
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
takes out
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
any concept of fines and also as was
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the public hearing there
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
is already a fine established for
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
violation of this section on the
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
universal fine schedule
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change that universal fine
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
schedule stays as it was it takes out
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
the monthly fines that would have to be
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
sent by mail and just creates a new
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
requirement that an individual
 
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
requirement that an individual
who

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
registered to vote here
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
same-day same-day registered vote here
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
presented an out-of-state driver's
 
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.149 align:start position:0%
presented an out-of-state driver's
license

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
with that their information would then
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
go over to the rmv
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they'd be able to tell if they
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
didn't comply with this section to
 
00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:43.029 align:start position:0%
didn't comply with this section to
either

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
transfer that driver's license to an
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
in-state one or file a new form
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
explaining why and then
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
the theorized acceptable reasons why or
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
either they moved back out of state or
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
they gave up their driving privilege
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
this would also create uh direct the
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
registry motor vehicles to send notices
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
which director todd said they do all the
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
time they do have the capability to send
 
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
time they do have the capability to send
notices

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
notices
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
for anyone that was more than 30 days
 
00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:07.029 align:start position:0%
for anyone that was more than 30 days
overdue

00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
overdue
 
00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
overdue
filing

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
filing
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
either transferring their license or
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
filing that form
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
so they'd be informed
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
and coming out of the voter registration
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
database they should have both an
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
in-state address and an out-of-state
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
address the out-of-state address is
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
whatever was associated with their
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
driver's license which the secretary of
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
state already records into this database
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of issuance and the
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license number
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the in-state address should be their
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
voting domicile which is already in that
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
database as well
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
so they'll get a notice that they
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
haven't done it if they do it that's
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
fine they're off the naughty list if
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
they don't do it we we have that we'll
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
have that list in the registry mode of
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles people that have
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
voted here not transferred driver's
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
license and not explained why
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
which was the original core intent of
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was to make sure that we narrow
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
that category down
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
um did you have conversations with the
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office as well yes
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh his biggest concern was that he
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be in a discretionary
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
role the original bill said apparent
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
violation and he didn't want to be in
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
the role of judging what a violation is
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
or isn't he just wants to provide
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.470 align:start position:0%
or isn't he just wants to provide
information

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.909 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman representative
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
prout thank you for taking this question
 
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
prout thank you for taking this question
so

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
how does this amendment change i'm
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
i've missed where you've changed
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
something so that the secretary of
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
state's office's concern is answered
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
so his biggest concern in the
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
information provision was that the
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
original bill said he should provide any
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
information on apparent violations of
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
rsaid all right 263-35 he didn't want to
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
be in the position of judging what an
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
apparent violation was or wasn't
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
i can't follow up
 
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
i can't follow up
yeah

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
i follow that what i'm asking you is
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
where in your amendment did you answer
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
his concern
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
so in the new subparagraph 2
 
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.269 align:start position:0%
so in the new subparagraph 2
um

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
that he'll he'll
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
provide records without a state driver's
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
license information where the record
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be matched to an in-state
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
driver's license obtained within the
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
deadline provided thank you i just
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
yep and and he won't judge whether it's
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
a violation of 235 just
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't meet those fixed
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
parameters he'll provide the information
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
over the registry and the registry and
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles will be the one judging
 
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles will be the one judging
whether

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the notice
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
the new notice provided in
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph b or c on in section one has
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
been provided whether the timelines were
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
met or anything else of that nature
 
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.830 align:start position:0%
met or anything else of that nature
thank

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here this morning uh

representative prout do you have any
idea

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
how how prolific this problem is
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
i mean do we have a
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
something from the secretary of state
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
x number of people presented a out of
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
state driver's license in order to
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
register to vote
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question at the public
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
hearing i handed out to the committee
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
the 2017 report
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was a joint report from the
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner safety and the secretary of
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
state analyzing the 2016 general
 
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
state analyzing the 2016 general
election

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't have a copy with me it's
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
probably my bag but there was just shy
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
of 6000 i believe individuals who
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
had same day registered a vote
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
with that same day registration
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
presented an out of state driver's
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
license and then i believe the report
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
was run some 10 months after the
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
election and at that 10 month mark
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
just shy of um i think it was 6 500 had
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
same day registered and just shy of 6
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
000 had still not transferred the
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.350 align:start position:0%
driver's license
okay

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'll add to that that i was involved
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
with a um
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
an evaluation of
 
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
an evaluation of
different

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
voting districts
 
00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:11.269 align:start position:0%
voting districts
and

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
i'll just bring up manchester for
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
instance there were
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
two of the 12 wards i think there's 12
 
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.870 align:start position:0%
two of the 12 wards i think there's 12
wards

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
wards
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
three wards that
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
that took the information that um he's
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
speaking about from the secretary of
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
state there were three awards that
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
actually wrote down
 
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
actually wrote down
um

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is the requirement wrote down the
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
state that the outer state driver's
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
license was from
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
three wards did that the other awards
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
indicated that there were none
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
that not a single person came in and and
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
wrote down
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
and used an out-of-state driver's
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
license so it's not
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
a perfect science i guess is my point
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
some places do it some places don't do
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
it so that's all i wanted to add
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if i mail i think if i
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
may i think you're talking about
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
existing voters already on the checklist
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to note when they when
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
they sign in but there's also i believe
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
a separate longer form for if you're
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
registering as a brand new voter
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct but when you register
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
as a as a brand new voter
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're taking that sheet and then they
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
write it in on the on the checklist and
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to indicate at that
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
point what driver's license was used
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and only as i said three out of the
 
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
and and only as i said three out of the
12

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
wards in manchester were actually doing
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
it so i'm not
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a perfect number that
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're that you're throwing out it's
 
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
you're that you're throwing out it's
it's

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
under reported if anything
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
andy representative
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
um looking at
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 20
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
it says the director for good cause
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
shown may grant an extension of a
 
00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:02.549 align:start position:0%
shown may grant an extension of a
deadline

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
i have a problem that it doesn't say an
 
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
i have a problem that it doesn't say an
exception

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
as we discussed at the hearing there are
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
situations where someone might move here
 
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.269 align:start position:0%
situations where someone might move here
and

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
become a non-driver or or
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
move here and and not
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
change their driver's license because
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're not a driver maybe a senior
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
citizen or something like that
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
and you just said that the director can
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
it has the information has been filed
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't you think there are some
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.630 align:start position:0%
don't you think there are some
exceptions

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
and is there any
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm just thinking this language
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that concern of mine
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
the situation raised really should fall
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
under paragraph c on line 14 on that
 
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.909 align:start position:0%
under paragraph c on line 14 on that
page

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:46.789 align:start position:0%
page
um

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
is my thinking that if they've you know
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
given up their driving privilege and and
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
either relinquished or uh their driver's
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
license in their you know original issue
 
00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
license in their you know original issue
state

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
they can file the form and say that and
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
then they that should take care of that
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
um to the point where whether someone
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
can keep their driver's license from the
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
state they moved from
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
after becoming a new hampshire resident
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
and just not drive here um
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see how that's allowed in the
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
existing language and paragraph that one
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
and now being moved into paragraph a
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard that the public
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
hearing that someone said that as long
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
as you never get behind the wheel of a
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
car in new hampshire this doesn't apply
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
why the person that said that thought
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
that was a true statement because at
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
least as i
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
am able to view everything i don't
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe it is a true statement can i
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
inquire well because someone might move
 
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
inquire well because someone might move
here

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.630 align:start position:0%
here
and

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
their lifestyle may change and they may
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
not be a driver so it that they're not
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
being forced to get a driver's license
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire you could have an
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
onset of a medical condition you can be
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
a senior citizen moving to be near their
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
family there's a lot of reasons why
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
someone would move here and not need to
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
get a new valid driver's license if
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing sorry i'm just seeing
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
someone from the dmv agree
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
nodding their head that there are
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
situations so i guess there are
 
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.190 align:start position:0%
situations so i guess there are
exceptions

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and like i said i thought that
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
was covered by paragraph c where as long
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
as they you know notify their former
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
state that i don't want my driver's
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
license anymore then they just file the
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
form contemplated in paragraph c
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.549 align:start position:0%
 
all handled

00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
all handled
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
let's uh well i'm going to ask the
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles next maybe
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
she can address it is there anything
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
else from
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none why don't i do this then uh
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
anybody from either the department of
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles or department of safety
 
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles or department of safety
i

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
would like to chime in on any
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
okay so um i saw this amendment uh
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon and kind of
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
responded back i know he's had
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
communications with deputy director todd
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if mr
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
todd has seen some of the items that i
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight back in regards to
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly open to continue
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
conversations with the representative on
 
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:19.909 align:start position:0%
conversations with the representative on
this

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
the administration of this and
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
understanding at what point does a
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
person become a resident is it when they
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
sign their lease documents so when they
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
walk into motor vehicles and we see that
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
they sign their lease document and say
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
june but they're not coming to us until
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
that october point we still issue them a
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
license we don't stop them we don't
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
prevent them but at that point would it
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
be the expectation that we would be
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
stopping and being like timeout um
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're over your 60-day window
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have the authority to issue
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
suspensions or citations and that would
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
be on law enforcement i think some of
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
the conversation i was hearing
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
was roadside so if you're in a community
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
and there is an officer that's aware
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
that you've overstayed that 60-day mark
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
and you're still on your out-of-state
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
place you're still on your out-of-state
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
registration you know they could be
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
cited for that currently as it is under
 
00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:10.549 align:start position:0%
cited for that currently as it is under
statute

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.509 align:start position:0%
statute
um

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
just some of the notes that i had tossed
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
the deputy director that
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know is this going to be through the
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
issuance of a citation
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
what about individuals who can register
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
a vehicle within the state of new
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire if they own property but you
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
do not have to obtain a new hampshire
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
license and i'm not sure if that was the
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
intent of 260 144 but that was more of a
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and i read that as a person
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
that can drive their vehicle in new
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire with their out-of-state plates
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
so what documents again would we be
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
looking at generally for law enforcement
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
and or the motor vehicles in regards to
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
the residency status at what point is
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that bona fide residency is it
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
through the actual establishment with
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
the town when they go that day to
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
register their vehicle or is it that day
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
when they come into motor vehicles
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
the form that
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
is contemplated within the proposed
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
language what is the expectation of dmv
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
when we get that do we need to be
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
reaching back
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
to these other jurisdictions saying hey
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
we just want to let you know that
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's a person here they haven't
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
obtained a license but they've been in
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
our state for this period of time um
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.509 align:start position:0%
our state for this period of time um
again

00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
how's that exchange of information going
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
to happen and what are the expectations
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:29.029 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
a paragraph be one of my concerns is
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
what constitutes ceasing to be a
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
resident at what point does a person
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
decide that they don't want to be
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
a resident like is there a hard date
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
they said on the state i'm no longer a
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
resident and then wait for them to
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
vacate are they in the transition of
 
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.950 align:start position:0%
vacate are they in the transition of
moving

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
do they have loose ends that they're
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
tying up before they can get back to
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
for paragraph c
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
relinquished after becoming a resident
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the state does this mean obtaining a
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire license to which that kind
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
of already meets 263 35 as we're talking
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
about if you're really positioning your
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
license is it are you
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
not renewing your license in the state
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
because i think it contemplates the
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
expiration of the license but then
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
relinquishing what is the difference um
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
just kind of understanding what that
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
the director shall notify an individual
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
that there appears to be they appear to
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
be in violation appears to be is
 
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.829 align:start position:0%
be in violation appears to be is
subjective

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
would we be taking the facts provided to
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
us in law enforcement again is this a
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
director's complaint there's just a lot
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
of things i think we would have to
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
figure out the administration of this
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay did you just say you would have to
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
figure it out or is is it figure out
 
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.230 align:start position:0%
figure it out or is is it figure out
able

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
able
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
i mean because i was first going to say
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're still going to
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
laugh a lot of questions but then your
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
last statement said that doesn't mean we
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
can't do it
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
we still have a lot of questions on what
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
this all means
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.630 align:start position:0%
okay um
again

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
i think i've got the point uh
 
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.430 align:start position:0%
i think i've got the point uh
representative

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you miss shoot um i'm curious
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's two two groups of people we
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed and i'm not quite sure
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
that we dealt with it at the public
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
hearing either which was
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
people who hold a non-driver
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
identification card and use that to vote
 
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
identification card and use that to vote
how

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
this would affect them
 
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
this would affect them
and

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
military who are here and stationed but
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
vote locally i'm curious how this would
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
may the witness is nodding yes
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
yes does that mean all of that so do you
 
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
yes does that mean all of that so do you
okay

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
um with anything else anybody else from
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh you it or not uh that's
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much all i wanted to accomplish
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
with this work session is just to have a
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
quick discussion over what we have in
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
albeit i know these bills are were heard
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
late and our deadlines are fast
 
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.589 align:start position:0%
late and our deadlines are fast
approaching

00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
approaching
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing else from the committee
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
we have the information again i'll talk
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsors in a couple of
 
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.829 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsors in a couple of
minutes

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the rest of our day is
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to look like 9 35
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
again that's what i wanted to accomplish
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
in this i do have our executive session
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10.
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
i figured we'd have a
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
we can take a break and have our
 
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.430 align:start position:0%
we can take a break and have our
respective

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
respective
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
meetings or caucuses whatever you'd like
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
to call them
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
and then get into our
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually i'm trying believe it
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
or not it may not sound it but i've been
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
thinking about this for a week trying to
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
make sure this is organized as possible
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for this workshop
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
so that when we get to exec session
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's my hopes that things go as smoothly
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll go have a meeting across
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to go across the hub you can
 
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:28.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to go across the hub you can
stay

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
all right so we shall we shall return
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to caucus
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
we shall return i came through
 
00:37:34.880 --> 01:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
we shall return i came through
and

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
all right welcome everybody sorry for
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
a couple things before we do get started
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
just trying to get as organized as
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
possible i know we have a lot of bills
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
to execute today it is the balance of
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
our bills
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully that organization will
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
help us move through our executive
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
sessions pretty smooth
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing i've been pretty
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
generous on reports
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
but facing our deadlines i'm going to
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
need all the reports from committee
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
members that make those motions before
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
we leave today whether they're on my
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
laptop or in hard copy matters not to me
 
01:42:09.679 --> 01:42:10.470 align:start position:0%
laptop or in hard copy matters not to me
but

01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have time to to wait for them
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
after this
 
01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
after this
session

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
i did have an order
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
that i put in not with for any
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
particular reason and i'm not
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to take them up in
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
that order either i know we're waiting
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
on possible amendments
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
on a couple
 
01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
on a couple
so

01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.199 --> 01:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the executive
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1341.
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's a definition of conviction
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative hill
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman i'm looking up
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry to catch you guys yeah i was
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for the 1401 bill to come
 
01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.550 align:start position:0%
waiting for the 1401 bill to come
through

01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
through
um

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
oh this uh this i think can be deemed as
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
it simply is crossing out uh for the
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
purposes of rsa 264 a forfeiture
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
a bail or collateral deposited to secure
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
an appearance in court
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
and for the purposes of commercial
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
driver's license statutes
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
it appears to be
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
something that the department had asked
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify and
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a very simple build thank you
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%

out to pass on house bill 1302
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
motions out to pass is there a second
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative hill
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
care to speak to your motion
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chair
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
the um i believe the statute was
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
probably always meant to apply to
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
prevent you from being ordered by a law
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer to drive your
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle not a commercial
 
01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:05.830 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle not a commercial
vehicle

01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
10 miles to a scale or submit to a
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
roadside way
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
most of the people that are being cited
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
for problems right now are getting
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
tagged other ways the scrap guys
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
unsecured or unsafe load
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
driving erratically because the vehicle
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
is overloaded there's a lot of ways to
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
do it and they can look at it by sight
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
they already have probable cause to pull
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
you over because of this so i don't
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
think the bill has any impact on what's
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
going on other than you can't be ordered
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
to drive 10 miles to a scale you get a
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
different ticket
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman so
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
um the the part that causes me
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
gives me pause is the fact that one the
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety was opposed to this
 
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.270 align:start position:0%
department of safety was opposed to this
bill

01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.470 align:start position:0%
bill
two

01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion it is a
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
because it's it just doesn't seem to be
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
that big of a problem and
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i think it's a bill that's not
 
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
i don't i think it's a bill that's not
necessary

01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%

clarifying the prohibition on using an
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
electronic or telecommunications device
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
while driving chair recognizes
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%

motions ought to pass is there a second
 
01:51:21.599 --> 01:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
motions ought to pass is there a second
second

01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative hill
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh would you care to speak to a motion
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
this changes the
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh the rsa
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's what it is it's a
 
01:51:36.639 --> 01:51:38.790 align:start position:0%
it's what it is it's a
housekeeping

01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
using a different rsa instead of the
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
original rsa which
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
the original rsa kind of prohibited
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
people from using bluetooth when they
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
were driving
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
they were in violation so this
 
01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
they were in violation so this
rsa

01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
brings in conformity that
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
people who are driving on the highway
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
can use bluetooth to communicate
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
but because it's a hands-free thing so
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
this just cleans it up
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i would be in support of this
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
motion it's a little bit of housekeeping
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
as called that needed to be done it
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies some of the
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
minor points of this uh differences
 
01:52:21.119 --> 01:52:22.149 align:start position:0%
minor points of this uh differences
between

01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
an old texting while driving bill
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
law versus the hands-free law
 
01:52:28.239 --> 01:52:29.430 align:start position:0%
law versus the hands-free law
and

01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a step in the right direction to
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
making hands-free convictions in court a
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit better and easier
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
and and i do concur uh just for history
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
this bill did pass last year went on
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
consent um
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
it demise was in the senate when they
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
piled on a bunch of amendments uh
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully that doesn't happen this time
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
um with nothing else from the committee
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the clerk to call the role when
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman i would move
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%

01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1447.
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
trump study is the motion do i hear a
 
01:56:42.159 --> 01:56:43.109 align:start position:0%

second

01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
second second by representative thompson
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on your motion
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative agne uh very simply um
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand what this bill
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
is going to do i think it has
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
more questions than answers
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
for one thing there's no list of
 
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
for one thing there's no list of
exceptions

01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's it needs work
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
there is some merit to it so i believe
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
real interim study could come up with
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
some solutions that would be amenable to
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
all parties concerned
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative sykes
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to note that
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
there are some important stakeholders
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
like the department of safety or the
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
aclu and others and they have opposing
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
positions as far as what what should be
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
done with this issue
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
and so i agree with uh
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
vice chairman gagne that this bill
 
01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
vice chairman gagne that this bill
raises

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
raises
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
as many questions as it may answer and
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
so interim study would be an appropriate
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
course of
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
action fair enough thank you sir any

01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
motion for consent was made by
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%

consent that is i'll close the
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 1447.
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh we'll take up
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to open up the executive
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1474
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
relative to annual vehicle inspections
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative smith
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
for a motion thank you mr chair and move
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
out to pass in house bill 1474.
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
motion is out to pass is there a second
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative gagne
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
do you care to speak to motion
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it supports all the
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
arguments that we've heard over the
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
years that a vehicle should be seen once
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
to get critical safety components
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
checked brakes wheel bearings ball
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
joints etc and a lot of that you're not
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
going to check yourself
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that it solves is
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
if you buy a car that is a few months
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
away but beyond the window that we have
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
to get inspected it isn't being seen
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
also low-income people they get hit with
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
a hundred couple of hundred bucks for
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
registration and immediately might also
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for a few hundred dollars
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
for repairs if they choose to
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can separate those events
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
by getting their car inspected in a
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
different month in their registration
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
their birthday's in december maybe they
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to do all that in june and have six
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
months between those bills it gives
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
people flexibility if they like it the
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
way it is now you don't have to do
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
anything different there's no safety
 
02:01:57.679 --> 02:01:58.790 align:start position:0%
anything different there's no safety
impact

02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it gives people the flexibility and
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
the cars are still seen every year there
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
was a little talk in the hearing about
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
confusion while the sticker's going to
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
match not match the registration anymore
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
right nothing to be confused about the
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
point is it doesn't matter the bottom
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
line on the bill is the stick is either
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
good or it's not that's not confusing
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussions from
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
the argument that took hold for me was
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
the one about economics for low-income
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
persons being challenged by this by the
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
current state of affairs for inspections
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
and registration
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
with that in mind i personally am going
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski thank you mr
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this would just be an
 
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
option for someone not forced upon
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
anyone so the number of people that
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually take advantage of this i think
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
are somewhat slim but those who could
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think it would uh it's primarily
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
people who do have older vehicles that
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
may require
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
more extensive safety repairs
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a good thing and
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
while i respect and understand
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the department of
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
safety that
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
it would be a new thing and hard to
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
educate i think
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh change can be sometimes a little bit
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
of a challenge but it doesn't
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean it's bad so i will be
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the all to pass also
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
discussion a question there and i
 
02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.870 align:start position:0%
discussion a question there and i
apologize

02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i just like clarification
 
02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i just like clarification
because

02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.430 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
when i look at this it appears that
 
02:03:52.719 --> 02:03:54.390 align:start position:0%
when i look at this it appears that
currently

02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can get your vehicle inspected four
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
months before
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
your the month of your birth
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that's crossed out it's so now is it
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
moved to four months after instead of
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
four months before or do you have both
 
02:04:08.719 --> 02:04:12.229 align:start position:0%
four months before or do you have both
options

02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
let me get to it unless representative
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure thing
 
02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:19.589 align:start position:0%
sure thing
it's

02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah because right now there's actually
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
a window
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
of 30 days because of the way the
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
statutes are worded where you might be
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
able to get a more than 12 month
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
registration but not an inspection i
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
can't remember works vice versa
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
this simplifies it whenever you choose
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
to go get your car inspected it's 12
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
months from then so the window's no
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
longer necessary
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that only occurs on your very first
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
registration anyway that window
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.669 align:start position:0%
can you
just

02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
what i'd currently do is i get my my car
 
02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.229 align:start position:0%
what i'd currently do is i get my my car
inspected

02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
usually not in my birth month
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
usually two you know um one or two
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
months earlier than that does this
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
negate my option to do that
 
02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:11.669 align:start position:0%
negate my option to do that
no

02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.679 --> 02:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
no this is really all about flexibility
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know vehicle
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
inspections i think are very important
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
here in our state to make sure that as a
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
driver that we know that there are
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
fellow cars on the road that are safe to
 
02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
fellow cars on the road that are safe to
drive

02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
drive
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
we had testimony
 
02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.149 align:start position:0%
we had testimony
from

02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
many people who mentioned that
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
part of the vehicle inspection has
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
caused found some rust issues on frame
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
of vehicles i know recently i brought i
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
bring my brought mine in
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it was discovered that there was
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
rust and i'm a person that brings it
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
brings my car in religiously to get
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
repaired so it catches those small
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
little things and i think that's
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
something real important that we need to
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
sustain in this
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
in our state so i
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
again vote for itl on hb 1426 thank you
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion from
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
so um thank you mr chairman so i would
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
echo the comments from my learned
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
colleague uh
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
recently made
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
about uh inspections they're an
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
important component of the
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
good safety record that this state has
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
but like all safety records this can it
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
can always be improved and so i do not
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
see this bill as being something that
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
improves our safety record and therefore
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
02:10:20.159 --> 02:10:23.430 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
committee

02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'll just say this on it
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
we see this bill quite often in
 
02:10:28.159 --> 02:10:29.830 align:start position:0%
we see this bill quite often in
transportation

02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
i'm a firm believer in the program that
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that some of the
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
issues that other people present are not
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
going unheard or are going unheard
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
i've already started the discussion for
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
maybe addressing some of those for next
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
year maybe looking at some of the
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
predatory stations that we may have not
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
saying we do
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually a national issue um and
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
also looking at the actual rules that
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
cause a vehicle to fail
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
i know we addressed rust or cosmetic
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
rust a few years ago and said
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a safety issue that shouldn't
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
fail a vehicle
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do one with exhaust
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
systems i mean you can go down the list
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
of a lot of things that currently are
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
failing vehicles that perhaps shouldn't
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to
 
02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:14.470 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to
address

02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
safety because they don't address safety
 
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
safety because they don't address safety
so

02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the itl today but
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that the conversations
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
about how to make this program better in
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
won't continue so
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh the motion on
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%

resident driver's license transfer
 
02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.709 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
crawford for a motion
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i make the motion
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
ocean's interim study dwight ii
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative hill
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
we care to speak to your motion
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
i believe that there's still a lot of
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
confusion in this bill and a lot of
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions that we have
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that i think the best avenue is to
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
have an interim study to answer some of
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
those questions

02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
um i agree as well there may be some
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
things we need to look at on this bill
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
but uh for the most part i think it's
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the concept is a good one and i
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
hope that when it gets
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
into the committee that
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
they can find solutions to bring back
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
another bill that we can pass
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
out of this committee thank you
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%

02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
while i can support interim study
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
i feel that uh as we have worked through
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
this bill it seems like
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
there just continues to be more flags
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
and problems that have come up with it
 
02:18:28.559 --> 02:18:29.509 align:start position:0%
and problems that have come up with it
so

02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
i will support it although i think that
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
it potentially
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
is looking to apply motor vehicle law in
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
such a way to people who aren't actually
 
02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.190 align:start position:0%
such a way to people who aren't actually
drivers

02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we can figure out a way
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we aren't
 
02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we aren't
unnecessarily

02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
imposing violations on those
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
should not be getting them but i thank
 
02:18:50.559 --> 02:18:52.309 align:start position:0%
should not be getting them but i thank
you

02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
um i will agree that was one of the
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
issues raised i do see the merit in this
 
02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:00.790 align:start position:0%
issues raised i do see the merit in this
um

02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
i'll take some responsibility of it i've
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
scheduled this late not not knowing
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately now we are looking at
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
deadlines with all the questions that
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
were still there
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh this is a legitimate interim study i
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
am interested in seeing this move
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
forward i just can't support it at this
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
time we still have a lot of questions
 
02:19:18.319 --> 02:19:19.349 align:start position:0%
time we still have a lot of questions
remaining

02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's a safety issue as far as i'm
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
concerned personally and as far as my
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned and i felt
 
02:28:58.479 --> 02:29:00.150 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned and i felt
that

02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
eliminating the speed limit on
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee whether it be in the
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
broads or not is a hazard to all those
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
who participate and
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
in recreation on the lake and therefore
 
02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:12.790 align:start position:0%
in recreation on the lake and therefore
i

02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
so i also
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
can and do support the itl motion
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
nothing in all of the testimony that we
 
02:29:28.319 --> 02:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
nothing in all of the testimony that we
heard

02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
give gave me any concrete data supported
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
decision to not keep the speed limit
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
which is a public safety issue it's the
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
prime directive of this of
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
transportation amongst others of course
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
to promote public safety and this this
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill would not do so so an itl motion is
 
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.230 align:start position:0%
bill would not do so so an itl motion is
appropriate

02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman um
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
i too will support the itl from the
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
various testimony from as my esteemed
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
colleague mentioned
 
02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:05.110 align:start position:0%
colleague mentioned
but

02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
more importantly what i'm more concerned
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
with is i appreciate the
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
responsible boat owners who might be
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
able to navigate this what i'm more
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
concerned with is the irresponsible ones
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
that if that kind of happens it can
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
cause some issues and because of that i
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
as one of the unfortunate co-sponsors of
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
early on i thought it wasn't a bad idea
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
after the response that i've gotten
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
well over 800 emails the majority of
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
those the vast majority against the bill
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative ankerberg thank
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman never afraid to take an
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
unpopular position i will note that
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
during the online hearing 601
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
signed in remotely to support the the
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill while only 206 opposed we also
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
heard that marine patrol takes no
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
position on this bill
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
seeing fit to allow the boating
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
community itself to
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
sort of self adjudicate how they would
 
02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:29.910 align:start position:0%
sort of self adjudicate how they would
uh

02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
wish um to be regulated
 
02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
wish um to be regulated
um

02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
with that given i will not support the
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
itl and i would hope that we would give
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
more thought to this given that this
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
committee in the past
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
has rejected um
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
body specific
 
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.230 align:start position:0%
body specific
legislation

02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
and where this is a state resource we
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
really should be acting in a uniform
 
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
manner across all different lakes and
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
ponds thank you
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for representing sorry thank
 
02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:08.309 align:start position:0%
thank you for representing sorry thank
you

02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
in the last century having been a
 
02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:11.349 align:start position:0%
in the last century having been a
helmsman

02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
helmsman
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
from time to time on a 360-foot
 
02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
from time to time on a 360-foot
destroyer

02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
destroyer
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
going through the atlantic there was no
 
02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
going through the atlantic there was no
problem

02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
going through the mediterranean things
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
got a little dicey
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
then the aegean sea loaded with islands
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
you really had to slow down and watch
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
what the hell you were doing because
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
people were going all over the place
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
going through the suez canal and into
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
the red sea things even got even
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
narrower even though the red sea is
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
relatively wide
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
a boat does not stop on a dime
 
02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.110 align:start position:0%
a boat does not stop on a dime
and

02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
i remember one time we had to stop an
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
emergency this little probably a
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
20-footer fishing boat in the red sea
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
was a dao or whatever they were they
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
were called with a big sail we're right
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
in our path
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
we saw it maybe
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a mile away by the
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
time we stopped it was only about 300
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
yards from us
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
so i would say
 
02:33:02.479 --> 02:33:03.910 align:start position:0%
so i would say
that

02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
speed kills
 
02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:08.630 align:start position:0%
speed kills
and

02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
i've i've been to lake winnipesaukee and
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
even though there are no speed limits on
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
other on other lakes i think the needs
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the many outweigh the needs of the
 
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
of the many outweigh the needs of the
few

02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
few
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'll be voting itl on
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
well i'll chime in on this
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
i knew you would um i've been navigating
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee for decades
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
i was opposed to the speed limit when it
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
was imposed made with 13 years ago for
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
the same reasons my colleague listed a
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago i couldn't have said it
 
02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
better myself
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
just a couple of other thoughts on it i
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
heard that this was somehow by lifting
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
the speed limit we would be putting
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
safety at jeopardy
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
i don't see that i think if this was
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a safety issue that the
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
marine patrol certainly would have
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
weighed in on it and they did not
 
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.270 align:start position:0%
weighed in on it and they did not
um

02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of traffic on the lake yeah it
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
can be busy on the weekends and like
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
every other speed limit these are these
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
are recommendations you can go slower if
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's busy we are expected to do the same
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
thing on the roads
 
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
if we have an issue with unqualified
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
boaters maybe we should be looking at
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
that we'll be talking about something
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
may help with that this afternoon
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime i didn't see any
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
data that showed
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
at all that that eliminating the daytime
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
speed limit was going to be a detriment
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
to safety so for that and principle
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
i am going to oppose
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
the itil
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
that being said i'll ask the chair to
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
call the rule when she's ready the
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is she gave me a
 
02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:48.950 align:start position:0%

as you may recall during the governor's
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
state of emergency in 2020 many new
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire programs were moved to an
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
online platform including the safe
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
boater education exam
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
emergency order number order 29 which i
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
exhibit one was signed by the governor
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
on may 22 2020 and provided that a safe
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
voter education course written test be
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
administered by a proctor or other
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
person approved to offer boating safety
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
courses shall be satisfied by any
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
applicant achieving a score of at least
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
90 percent on an online boating safety
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
course written test that is not
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
proctored or administered by an
 
04:09:28.399 --> 04:09:30.630 align:start position:0%
proctored or administered by an
instructor

04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
this emergency order was in effect until
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
july 1 2021 when the state of emergency
 
04:09:36.880 --> 04:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
july 1 2021 when the state of emergency
expired

04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
expired
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would modify new hampshire
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
safe border education statute to allow
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the exam to be taken via an online
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
platform consistent with the emergency
 
04:09:49.199 --> 04:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
platform consistent with the emergency
order

04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
we saw record numbers of future voters
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
taking the exam when this option was
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
provided and i believe this legislation
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
will continue to allow access to the
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
exam that may not be otherwise attained
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
governor sununu indicated last year that
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
there were numerous emergency orders
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
that could be put into law and i
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that this is one
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
part of the bill is also
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
the the bill also exempt certain
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
commercial driver instructors from
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements so long as they
 
04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
meet federal standards

04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%

i can tell you
 
04:11:30.159 --> 04:11:31.189 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
that

04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
caught us a little bit by surprise in
 
04:11:33.520 --> 04:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
caught us a little bit by surprise in
december

04:11:35.110 --> 04:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
december
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
but there's a whole new training
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that was put on on the
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
and we needed to update the current
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
statutes within our state law
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the cdl licenses
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure we can conform to the new
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
requirements for trainer education
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
they put in some requirements for
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
trainers to be
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
registered online
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
they outlined how many hours and what
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
training needed to take place maybe not
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
how many hours but what training things
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
you need to cover
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
and there were also
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
classroom training as well as driver
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
training and it all went into effect
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
february 7th
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the federal agency that put this in
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
did give a waiver for the state of new
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire to catch up its laws for 90
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
days that waiver was provided back in
 
04:12:28.560 --> 04:12:30.469 align:start position:0%
days that waiver was provided back in
january

04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
january
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
this what this legislation does is it
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
corrects our statute so we can utilize
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
this training
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
i represent a number of contractors that
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
have lots of trucks they need cdl
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
drivers some of them do some of this
 
04:12:45.840 --> 04:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
drivers some of them do some of this
training

04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
so with that there's also a public
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
component for people to get trained for
 
04:12:51.520 --> 04:12:52.710 align:start position:0%
component for people to get trained for
smaller

04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
contractors and truckers and
 
04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
the rest so
 
04:12:59.110 --> 04:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're here today in support of this
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
legislation because we need it to be
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
passed within the time frame of the 90
 
04:13:03.920 --> 04:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
passed within the time frame of the 90
days

04:13:05.110 --> 04:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
to meet the federal requirement and have
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
it comply
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
now i'm not the expert at the language
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was produced the department of
 
04:13:12.880 --> 04:13:14.149 align:start position:0%
that was produced the department of
safety

04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner richard bailey is
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
probably the key guy that worked on this
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
so i want to give him a lot of credit in
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
with connections with the attorney
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
general's office but i'm one of the
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
associations that has truckers
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
we've already put out a lot of materials
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
to our members on how to conform to this
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
new regulation
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
it you know
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
you have to step back and say hey
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
what the federal government had worked
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
on for two years i guess it was in the
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
making for two years just wasn't aware
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
of that when they rolled it out was
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a surprise
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
but it's good for our industry to make
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
sure there's proper training of those
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
people driving our trucks and cdls so i
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
think everything that's there
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of meetings with all
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the appropriate agencies and it's
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
been very productive to help us make
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
sure we can conform to those new
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements so i'm sure you're going to
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
hear from the department of safety that
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
they require this in order for somebody
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
to newly get a cdl license
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm totally here in support of this
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill so that you can
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
pass it as soon as possible so that way
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
we conform with our statutes to what the
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
feds have put in place
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%

question can you just um give us a
 
04:17:07.110 --> 04:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
little information on um how your
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh company deals with um the security i
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
know that there's some always has been
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
some concerns with online testing
 
04:17:17.110 --> 04:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
platform sure um how you deal with that
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
sure so one of the ways we are extremely
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
concerned with it and we're always
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to improve the the
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
security of our of our testing products
 
04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we've done is we
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
piloted a program
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
and we tested it with two of our
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
products one in california one in
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
florida we did a project last year with
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
those two states
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and did a verification system where
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
students went through and did
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
user verification they entered
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
their government-issued id at the
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the testing project or at
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of their
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
their test taking
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
at the start of the course and then
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the course that was verified
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
that they were the same person taking
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
the test so if i enter my government
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
instead i'm stephen bristow that was
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
verified throughout the course that i
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
was the same person taking that course
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
until the end of the course
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
the court that project has proven so
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
successful that we've expanded it to all
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
of our projects or to all of our
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%

woods uh thank you i'm a substitute so
i'm

04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
not known here very well uh just a quick
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you mr chair uh is
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
this a
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
innovative kind of uh
 
04:18:40.800 --> 04:18:42.630 align:start position:0%
innovative kind of uh
um

04:18:42.630 --> 04:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
security procedure or is this sort of
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
more standardized along the lines
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
of when you take an online course like
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
my son-in-law just finished his mba
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they had a very distinct protocol
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
of verifying that he was in fact
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
taking the test and he was not getting
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
input from anybody else
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
is that sort of a standard for the all
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
the universities use or is this
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
something that's very peculiar
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
and uh sort of another level of security
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
well we're not a university sir but it
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
is privately becoming
 
04:19:13.840 --> 04:19:14.830 align:start position:0%
is privately becoming
a

04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
standardized for anybody that's doing
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
any type of online education product
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:19:23.840 --> 04:19:25.030 align:start position:0%
any further questions
representative

04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry fellows oh thank you mr
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
chairman can can you just explain what
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
that verification process is how how is
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
it that you know
 
04:19:37.110 --> 04:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
exactly who it is that's
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
attending each lesson of the class and
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
exactly who it is
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's taking the online test
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
sure and i will apologize because techn
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
the technology is not my forte my
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way the process
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
works is that
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would submit
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
my driver's license or a government
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
issued id
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the process and then
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
that is verified against
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
the i i submit my id and then a picture
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
is taken at various points
 
04:20:10.399 --> 04:20:11.349 align:start position:0%
is taken at various points
and

04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
at as i take the
 
04:20:13.279 --> 04:20:14.309 align:start position:0%
at as i take the
the

04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
test or as i take the course
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the two are compared so that if
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
the two pictures don't match up
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:20:25.680 --> 04:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
the uh
uh

04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's flagged and
 
04:20:28.960 --> 04:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
it's flagged and
that

04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
the uh technology is sent back and
 
04:20:35.830 --> 04:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
an incident is flagged and then
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
we can review it at that point and say
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay this incident shows that you had
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
two people that don't match up
 
04:20:44.960 --> 04:20:45.910 align:start position:0%
two people that don't match up
and

04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
at that point you can say okay we have
 
04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:20:55.680 --> 04:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
carol

04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
carol
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair could you tell me um
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about pictures being
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
taken are those pictures held or are
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
they uh do you you know
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
again i'm
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm not the technology person my
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they are destroyed
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
immediately after the person is done
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
with the course the user consents to
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
using them and those are being done as
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
soon as they're done with the course
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're destroyed
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding again i'm not
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:21:35.359 --> 04:21:36.790 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
representative

04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
is there anything in the technology that
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
you use to verify the individual
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent that
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
individual from
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's taking the course and the
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately the exam from having somebody
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
coach them in the room with them to help
 
04:21:57.040 --> 04:21:58.550 align:start position:0%
coach them in the room with them to help
them

04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know give them the answer so to
 
04:21:59.920 --> 04:22:04.309 align:start position:0%
you know give them the answer so to
speak

04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
again i think that
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
it depends on how sensitive you set the
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:22:12.720 --> 04:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
the uh
parameters

04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
you can set it to to
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
as sensitive as
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
if i notice that you look away for a
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
specific period of time or if there's
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
too much movement away from the monitor
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much i
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
i usually say them for the end but i
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
think in this case uh the chair
 
04:22:44.720 --> 04:22:47.269 align:start position:0%
think in this case uh the chair
recognizes

04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee i'm rick bailey i'm the
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the department
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
i will be brief but happy to answer
 
04:23:04.560 --> 04:23:05.510 align:start position:0%
i will be brief but happy to answer
questions

04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:06.389 align:start position:0%
questions
the

04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought forward in
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
the senate that's part of the bill now
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
that deals with how the entry-level
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
driver training program will work here
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:23:19.110 --> 04:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
there was a very unusual portion of the
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
federal law that deferred to state law
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we've only contemplated
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
driver education for 16 and 17 year olds
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
because once you become 18 all you have
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
to do is pass the test you do not have
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
any prerequisite of a formal training
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
the entry level driver training program
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the federal level is in fact a driver
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
education program that's spelled out
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
very clearly in
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
federal law and rules that is a
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
full-blown how to drive a cdl all the
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
things you need to consider
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
the challenge that came up was because
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
we had never contemplated
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
advanced driver training if you will it
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear in the legal review as to
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether all the requirements that we
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
have for driver ed instructors who are
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
teaching 16 and 17 year olds
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
would all of a sudden become
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
applicable to people that are providing
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
the entry-level driver training program
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
um and so we took the two steps that mr
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
abbott talked about we asked for a
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
waiver uh from the federal government to
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
waive the portion of the law that says
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
they defer to state requirements
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
so that we had an opportunity to bring
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
before you this requirement to make it
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
clear that people who are compliant with
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
the federal program
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
have no additional requirements placed
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
on that instruction either but for the
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
course or the instructor
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire state law or rule and
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:24:49.199 --> 04:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman walsh
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh assistant commissioner bailey i know
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the recent past that i believe the
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
federal government has tried to
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
recognize a problem for cdl licensure
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that if you were under if you were 18
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
but not 21 you could only drive
 
04:25:15.990 --> 04:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
cdl in your state
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
and is that still the case yes but
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's under consideration it's in
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
discussions at the federal motor carrier
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
safety administration as to whether
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
lower from 21 perhaps to 18 or something
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
in between because of the substantial
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
shortage of long-haul truck drivers so
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
this does not follow up
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure so this is not
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
fixing that problem yet
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
no and even but there's an effort to to
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's a separate effort to deal with
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
that problem but this training
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirement would apply to anybody if if
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
they do lower the age they would those
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
applicants would still have to go
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
through this training program
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't create another conflict
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
down the road if they change the age
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirement no it doesn't okay thank you
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.149 --> 04:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good to see you it's
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
been a while
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable asking a question
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
about the boater portion of this
 
04:26:17.520 --> 04:26:19.590 align:start position:0%
about the boater portion of this
uh

04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
lieutenant mclean is here i can give it
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
a try we'll see where we go all right is
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
he coming up or jeez
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
you can come on crystal
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
oh it's an easy one so
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.760 --> 04:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
so in in reading the uh the proposed
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendments of the language
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like it doesn't change
 
04:26:43.110 --> 04:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
the nature of the test at all it's still
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
a proctored examination the only change
 
04:26:45.279 --> 04:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
a proctored examination the only change
is

04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:48.870 --> 04:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
who can administer it so is it correct
 
04:26:48.880 --> 04:26:49.670 align:start position:0%
who can administer it so is it correct
the

04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
even if this passes the test is still
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to be administered under
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
supervised conditions
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're just allowed to have somebody
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
else do it
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is crystal mclean
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the record and i'm with state police
 
04:27:05.110 --> 04:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
marine patrol that is correct that it
 
04:27:07.110 --> 04:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
will still be a
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
a proctored exam
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a housekeeping issue
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the language of the law and we have
 
04:27:17.110 --> 04:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have sought legal counsel and uh it
 
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
is more of a housekeeping item as
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
proposed for the boating part of it
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
lieutenant can you just confirm what i
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
think i heard in the previous testimony
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
that already we have an online training
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
and testing program for snowmobiles
 
04:27:38.479 --> 04:27:40.229 align:start position:0%
and testing program for snowmobiles
ohrvs

04:27:40.229 --> 04:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
ohrvs
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
and are those programs successful
 
04:27:45.269 --> 04:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
i can confirm the boating portion of
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
that i
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the snowmobile and the
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
ohrv where fish and game houses that
 
04:27:51.359 --> 04:27:53.429 align:start position:0%
ohrv where fish and game houses that
typically

04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
typically
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
i could defer to the kalkamai
 
04:27:55.760 --> 04:27:58.950 align:start position:0%
i could defer to the kalkamai
representative

04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you both very much thank you
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
sorry representative fellows
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair since i'm a
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
substitute i'm not up to speed
 
04:28:13.110 --> 04:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
as much as the other people here
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
but is is it the case that somebody can
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
get a boating license by taking a test
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't ever have to get into a
 
04:28:21.120 --> 04:28:23.030 align:start position:0%
but they don't ever have to get into a
boat

04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
boat
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
currently the way the law is written
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
they anybody that's going to operate a
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
boat that has an engine with greater
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
than 25 horsepower has to have safe
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
boating education there's a couple of
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
methods that they can take to comply
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
with that law
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
both in state and federally
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
over that they do need to have that
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
voting education certificate currently
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
there is no practical requirement
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes jody gambrellis from

new hampshire marine trades association
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is jody
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
grimbolus i'm the lobbyist for the new
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire marine trades association that
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
is the new hampshire group of small
 
04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
businesses that work in the marine
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
industry and really focus on
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
recreational boating
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of senate bill
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
307 and specifically
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
can talk to the beginning of the the
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
we see this as a very positive
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
step forward for boater safety education
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
having that ability to do that proctored
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
test online would be a great innovation
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's more convenient for the boaters
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly it makes them take
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire test and not the
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
florida test which is also accepted here
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we'd rather see new hampshire boaters
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
people boating in new hampshire on
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
vacation take the new hampshire test
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
which is specific to new hampshire laws
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
then take it from another state where
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
they can do it all online and then come
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
here we have different safe passage laws
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
than other states we have different
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know different buoy systems than
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
other states and we'd really like them
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
to take the entire test with the new
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire information we also think it's
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
a benefit because then new hampshire
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
keeps those dollars so if they're going
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
to spend money on the boater education
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
do it in new hampshire not florida so i
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
hope that's helpful
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions i can but
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
from a practical perspective the marinas
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
that see renters or new boaters think
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire test is the one to
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
take and if this helps do that then
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%

04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we represent the state's forest
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
landowners forest products industry
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
and like gary abbott our interest in the
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill is the cdl portion of the the bill
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
sections two through i think it's
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
sections two through five
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
our members run a lot of trucks they
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
they ship logs from the forest to the
 
04:31:38.080 --> 04:31:39.349 align:start position:0%
they ship logs from the forest to the
sawmills

04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
sawmills
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then they ship lumber from the
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
sawmills to the home depots of the world
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:31:46.710 --> 04:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
like every other industry
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's scrambling for truck drivers
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
and and having
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
this bill will help
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier with some of the
 
04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
training requirements get us in
 
04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
alignment with the federal requirements
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
as they're getting rolled out and so
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
we're fully in support of it the other
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's not watering down any of the
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
training requirements it's not going to
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
create unsafe conditions out there on
 
04:32:13.110 --> 04:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
the roads it brings us into alignment
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the federal standards and we
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe that overall this will help
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
kind of streamline the process and
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get more young men and
 
04:32:21.520 --> 04:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get more young men and
women

04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
women
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
licensed and on the road driving our
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
logs and lumber with that i'll conclude
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%

04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
was the applicable person in here
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
it seems to be the the language that was
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned to us by the uh by the prime
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%

the committee
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the amendment

04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the changes that were made
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
but i i wonder and worry if it goes far
 
04:50:36.240 --> 04:50:37.350 align:start position:0%
but i i wonder and worry if it goes far
enough

04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
um because there are additional
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
04:50:41.200 --> 04:50:43.990 align:start position:0%
questions so
i

04:50:43.990 --> 04:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah the amendment doesn't quite go far
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
enough from my from my perspective
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
although it does answer part of the
 
04:50:51.600 --> 04:50:53.350 align:start position:0%
although it does answer part of the
questions

04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%

04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question i did
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
want to know about we had a discussion i
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
think about the possible amendment uh
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
last time
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of addressing high efficiency
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles in terms of following the vin
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
number versus the person
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i didn't know if there'd been any
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
with an eye towards that amendment i
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
mean i don't see it in here there may
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
have been some discussion
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
can you say that one more time in terms
 
04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the issue uh we had talked about
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether there would be any
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
benefit to
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
clean the amendment effort to address
 
04:52:05.670 --> 04:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
high efficiency vehicles specifically or
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
following the vin number as opposed to
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
the owner on the vehicle i guess it's
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
lessee a renter now also but
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i hadn't heard any further discussion
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it's needed or what the
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
amendment was pretty simple okay
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of just adding that third party
 
04:52:24.000 --> 04:52:25.110 align:start position:0%
in terms of just adding that third party
um

04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
to enforce motor vehicle tax laws i
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
everything else should stay the same the
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
yep rebels
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle sorry
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
public authority authorized to enforce
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle tax law so are we saying
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
that the other issues that came up in
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:52:57.190 --> 04:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
um odometer tampering for resale or
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
title stuff or any of those other issues
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
that were raised with the department of
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
safety wouldn't fall under or state farm
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
also was opposed to it wouldn't fall
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
under this because those are not tax
 
04:53:09.120 --> 04:53:10.628 align:start position:0%
under this because those are not tax
issues

04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's how i read it
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
basically all the other issues
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment the way i read it is
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
pretty simple all the other issues we
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
heard from the uh
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
from the title bureau et cetera et
 
04:53:25.840 --> 04:53:27.190 align:start position:0%
from the title bureau et cetera et
cetera

04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
they are not um
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
public authorities authorized in vehicle
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
tax laws so they wouldn't have
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
this bill has no impact on them that's
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
how i read it
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so we're
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment correct
 
04:53:47.360 --> 04:53:48.628 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment correct
so

04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing the only entity i can
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
think of
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
that they would not be able to share the
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
information with is the municipality
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
i am not sure
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
can you try to rephrase that because
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
at what point
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
the municipalities even require mileage
 
04:54:26.480 --> 04:54:32.070 align:start position:0%
the municipalities even require mileage
now

04:54:32.070 --> 04:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
no motor vehicle no mileage information
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
shall be shared with any public entity
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
authorized to enforce motor vehicle
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax laws
 
04:54:51.840 --> 04:54:52.868 align:start position:0%
tax laws
so

04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
but not on mileage
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
and so to to your point i think it
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that to your point i think i
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you as a public authority
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
authorizing the enforcement of motor
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle tax laws
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
with this amendment i would say
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities wouldn't get the mileage
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
unless consented by the owner or lessee
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't know of an instance where
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities currently look for
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
the municipalities make out the
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
applications for titles
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh which do require a mileage
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
declaration on them
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
so they have that information anyway at
 
04:55:45.270 --> 04:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a confirmation of they
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't go and check your
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
odometer to do it that's
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
you're writing that information on the
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
transfer paperwork right
 
04:56:10.230 --> 04:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
so there still wouldn't be any transfer
 
04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
of information that i can see well and
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
if there is it's actually done
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily by the right because they're
 
04:56:17.430 --> 04:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
from the owner they're filling out the
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a sharing correct
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
indulging me in the water i bought you
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
some time you did you did a good job
 
04:56:30.798 --> 04:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
some time you did you did a good job
um

04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so i
 
04:56:36.550 --> 04:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
i see this as a problem because they
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
need that information
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it says you can't
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
give the information to the local towns
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written it doesn't say
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
why you can't give it to him it just
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
says you
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
can't and
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
it there's no explanation of it beyond
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
that it just says
 
04:57:01.590 --> 04:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
use you know does tax
 
04:57:03.440 --> 04:57:04.550 align:start position:0%
use you know does tax
information

04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:57:06.550 --> 04:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
they can't have the information
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
but they do do other
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
they do need that for other purposes is
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think the keyword is shared so
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
and it's shared by the department or an
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
inspection station it says nothing about
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
whether the owner can share the
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
i agree with that if you read the
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
language it's pretty clear it doesn't
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent the owner or the or the
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
lessee or anybody else that
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
is going to share that information
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a department doing that or an
 
04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
inspection station it's the owner
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
the leasee of the the vehicle that
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
shares that so i don't think it applies
 
04:58:23.590 --> 04:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
to them in in the case of uh the mileage
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
that's done on a transfer on a title
 
04:58:28.550 --> 04:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
it actually goes further and says
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the vehicle's
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
owner lisey or renter so
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
they would be consenting to do it if
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted it shared yep
 
04:58:39.040 --> 04:58:40.830 align:start position:0%
they wanted it shared yep
anybody

04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
else see nothing else we'll vote on the
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
i can do it voice vote but with this
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussion why don't we call the roll on
 
04:58:51.120 --> 04:58:51.990 align:start position:0%
discussion why don't we call the roll on
it

04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%

04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do that
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
all right so uh thank you thank you for
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%

04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
new new hampshire citizens from from
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
being taxed there have been talks in the
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
federal government i have personally
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
heard secretary budejig talk about doing
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
this particular tax and i think with
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on right now
 
05:00:11.910 --> 05:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
this bill will just create a small
 
05:00:11.920 --> 05:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
this bill will just create a small
firewall

05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
firewall
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
to protect our new hampshire citizens
 
05:00:15.120 --> 05:00:15.830 align:start position:0%
to protect our new hampshire citizens
from

05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:00:17.990 --> 05:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
another unwarranted tax
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why i vote for otp of 1401
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any other comments
 
05:00:27.670 --> 05:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative trojan thank you mr chair
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
is another note um it also helps the
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
consumer or the owner of the vehicle
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
from not having
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
that information then get go to the
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company which would then
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
probably set rates based on the mileage
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
driven so that's a kind of a byproduct
 
05:00:41.920 --> 05:00:45.910 align:start position:0%
driven so that's a kind of a byproduct
benefit

05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:00:49.750 --> 05:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the part of this that i'm struggling
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
with is twofold
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
one is that this bill as it's currently
 
05:00:56.000 --> 05:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
one is that this bill as it's currently
amended

05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
would not allow a state vehicle vehicle
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
mile travel tax either
 
05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
because they can't share the information
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
and yet there's efforts
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
bipartisan efforts in this house to
 
05:01:14.550 --> 05:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
look at that the need for additional
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
revenues to maintain our roads and
 
05:01:17.040 --> 05:01:19.110 align:start position:0%
revenues to maintain our roads and
bridges

05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
which the
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
road toll continues to drop
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
every year of the amount of money that's
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
being collected so i have a little bit
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
of a problem
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
where this i believe this
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
prohibits the state from doing it as
 
05:01:32.638 --> 05:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
prohibits the state from doing it as
well

05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
i understand um the point that the owner
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
lisi or renter
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle could consent to share
 
05:01:43.190 --> 05:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
this information
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
but that smacks of
 
05:01:48.550 --> 05:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
i joe citizen get to decide whether i
 
05:01:51.030 --> 05:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
want to pay my taxes or not
 
05:01:51.040 --> 05:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
want to pay my taxes or not
and

05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:51.840 --> 05:01:53.270 align:start position:0%
and
i

05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a whole separate
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and i don't know that we need
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
to be wading into that
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
that kind of discussion by creating law
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i was um
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
representing sykes touched on what i was
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to say but
 
05:02:16.948 --> 05:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
i just want to emphasize that with the
 
05:02:16.958 --> 05:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
i just want to emphasize that with the
increased

05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
efforts towards a more green future and
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles transitioning towards
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
better mileage and even fully on
 
05:02:30.390 --> 05:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles that don't pay any
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
road gasoline tax through the road toll
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
we're in a really difficult position as
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
a state to figure out how we're going to
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
maintain our roads
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
there has already been a significant
 
05:02:41.600 --> 05:02:42.868 align:start position:0%
there has already been a significant
drop

05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
drop
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
in revenue from the gas tax
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
due to just simply you know
 
05:02:50.788 --> 05:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
honda crvs now getting 32 miles to the
 
05:02:50.798 --> 05:02:51.910 align:start position:0%
honda crvs now getting 32 miles to the
gallon

05:02:51.910 --> 05:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
never mind putting on full electric
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles on these roads and it is a
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
problem that as a state we are going to
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
have to figure out and this is
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
closing any opportunity we have
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
to address
 
05:03:08.320 --> 05:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
to address
the

05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
road usage
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
as one of the factors we can at least
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
discuss and i think it is
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh inappropriate to
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
close that door before we even have a
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss it
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against the ought to
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
this is why we have
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
these exercises this is why we do this
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong and i'll take
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
some help from anybody else reading this
 
05:03:39.830 --> 05:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
thing when we heard
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
it was the understanding that this was a
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
firewall against
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
the federal attempt at an additional
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
mileage tax on us and i think we can all
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
agree to that
 
05:03:52.868 --> 05:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
and it was also said at that time that
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
there was no intention by the prime
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor to
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
prevent the state of new hampshire from
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
implementing the same thing if we
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
decided to be fit
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
because we do have a problem i think we
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
can all understand that too
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
does this language prevent new hampshire
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
from doing it
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
i mean granted if we wanted to down the
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
road this could be reversed just as easy
 
05:04:14.080 --> 05:04:15.110 align:start position:0%
road this could be reversed just as easy
um

05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
but uh what say you
 
05:04:17.440 --> 05:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
but uh what say you
anybody

05:04:20.550 --> 05:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman there there is an
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
issue with the mileage
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
fee that would be associated with the
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
the usage
 
05:04:30.868 --> 05:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
regarding out-of-state vehicles coming
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
here um and how they that would be
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
implemented to them so somebody coming
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
from you know california driving out
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
here um you know so there there are
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
alternatives to mileage in terms of a
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
road usage fee um the primarily the at
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
least in terms of my perspective on that
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
the the biggest hurdle there is privacy
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
and not creating an intrusive
 
05:04:54.400 --> 05:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
and not creating an intrusive
um

05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know setting up waypoints and then
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
tracking people around with identifiable
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
data like that
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
but there are discussions of course this
 
05:05:06.150 --> 05:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
is a a large issue um we all know we
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
need funding
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
but that this in my understanding that
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
this this amendment this bill
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
is intended to
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
protect the new hampshire taxpayer the
 
05:05:19.990 --> 05:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire driver
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle owner operator
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
from having them be tracked
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
from the federal government right so if
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're worried about state issues i'm not
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know best by mileage
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
whereas we have other people using our
 
05:05:41.040 --> 05:05:42.628 align:start position:0%
whereas we have other people using our
roadways

05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
that are new hampshire citizens and also
 
05:05:44.638 --> 05:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
that are new hampshire citizens and also
none

05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
none
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of what we do in the future is
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
another issue but point taken anybody
 
05:05:56.550 --> 05:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
else in the community represents erosion
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and again there's
 
05:06:00.070 --> 05:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
a at the beginning of the paragraph
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
there there's a little closet
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding any provision of
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
the law to the contrary so if down the
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
road we decided we wanted to
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
um tax electric vehicles by the mileage
 
05:06:13.040 --> 05:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
um tax electric vehicles by the mileage
driven

05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
driven
 
05:06:13.920 --> 05:06:14.868 align:start position:0%
driven
which

05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
personally i'm not in favor of period i
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
mean there are other are other ways that
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
we can tax those vehicles um
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
that first part of the paragraph
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
gives a
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
do it if we decide at the state level we
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to tax that way
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
point taken
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
so what the biggest concern that i can
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
see about this bill
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
takes or removes a tool that we as state
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
government probably have
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
operations and every time you take away
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
a tool it then further restricts what we
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
are able to do
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
and makes it harder and you may end up
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
with something that you don't want
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
because you took away a tool
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
and that's my biggest objection to this
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're taking away a tool from state
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
government about how to raise funds to
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
pay for things
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
yes there
 
05:07:14.310 --> 05:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
will be questions about how this gets
 
05:07:14.320 --> 05:07:15.030 align:start position:0%
will be questions about how this gets
done

05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the future but if you take the tool
 
05:07:18.550 --> 05:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
away that we will never have those
 
05:07:18.560 --> 05:07:21.350 align:start position:0%
away that we will never have those
discussions

05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
no legislature can bind a future
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislature so there would be
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
we may be taking that tool away to use
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
your your term
 
05:07:34.400 --> 05:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
your your term
but

05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
that tool can always be put back into it
 
05:07:39.190 --> 05:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
by a
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
simple repeal word um so i'm not sure i
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
would say this will never happen
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
but i don't know why um
 
05:07:48.718 --> 05:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
but i don't know why um
i

05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
thought process um to say that
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
this is removing the tool other than for
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
what the prime sponsor suggested that it
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
it creates that firewall from
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
any kind of federal
 
05:08:04.480 --> 05:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
any kind of federal
licensor

05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.000 --> 05:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
one representative sykes so thank you
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative hill um
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
i i would only observe
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
in my
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm a newbie i've only this is i've
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
only been doing this for 10 years
 
05:08:22.320 --> 05:08:23.590 align:start position:0%
only been doing this for 10 years
um

05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
i would only observe that repealing laws
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
is more difficult than it is to pass
 
05:08:28.638 --> 05:08:29.590 align:start position:0%
is more difficult than it is to pass
them

05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so i just
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
throw that out there
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
i i think you have a valid point that we
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
could change it at some point but it is
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
a little more difficult by past
 
05:08:38.000 --> 05:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
a little more difficult by past
experience

05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:08:42.718 --> 05:08:45.270 align:start position:0%
anybody else
see

05:08:45.270 --> 05:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
i would just make the point that this
 
05:08:49.270 --> 05:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
this talks about tax laws when we talk
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
about the road toll there's there's a
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
difference between a usage fee
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
and a levied tax
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know and one is unconstitutional and
 
05:08:59.910 --> 05:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
the other one is
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:09:01.520 --> 05:09:02.628 align:start position:0%
you know
allowable

05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
right so this talks about tax laws
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about a usage fee
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
you know that i'm not even sure that
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
that would necessarily apply in
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
something like this like under this
 
05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's unclear as well another good
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
point and let's hope the federal
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
government's not watching and they call
 
05:09:22.400 --> 05:09:22.410 align:start position:0%
theirs a fee instead
 
05:09:22.410 --> 05:09:23.910 align:start position:0%
theirs a fee instead

no but i don't have the amendment for
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
the last one
 
05:11:06.410 --> 05:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
is a really bad amendment
 
05:11:06.420 --> 05:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
is a really bad amendment
[Laughter]

05:11:11.270 --> 05:11:11.280 align:start position:0%

i have a curious question
tom

05:11:27.910 --> 05:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
tom
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
do you know if this is going to finance
 
05:11:29.520 --> 05:11:43.270 align:start position:0%
do you know if this is going to finance
yeah

05:11:43.270 --> 05:11:43.280 align:start position:0%

yeah i mean in fairness yeah
 
05:11:48.550 --> 05:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
well and actually because we're past the
 
05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
deadline for second committee bills
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
if they deem it to be such i wonder what
 
05:11:54.550 --> 05:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
happens there i don't know that would be
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
a shame thanks larry
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%

second invite representative crawford
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay this is the long awaited
 
05:16:22.550 --> 05:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
for amendment house bill 1534. as you
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
remember from the public hearing
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
department of safety had an issue the
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
way the original language
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody with a four-door antique
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to run such side exhausts
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i did get a series of amendments
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
finally this one shows
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
that it will be to the rear edge of
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
either door if it has two doors into the
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
rear edge of either rear door if the
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle has four doors
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh any such system shall direct exhaust
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
away from the vehicle
 
05:16:49.840 --> 05:16:50.788 align:start position:0%
away from the vehicle
so

05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:52.830 --> 05:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's pretty self-explanatory and i
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe uh i hope the department of
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
safety is okay with it too i see a head
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
shaking back there
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%

05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
second by representative thompson do you
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to motion
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh certainly um
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
05:21:28.638 --> 05:21:29.430 align:start position:0%
no problem
um

05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
my computer is not
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
functional but i will tell you that i
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a number of things
 
05:21:39.270 --> 05:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
that i object on this legislation
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
one of which is if you
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you go through part b
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
all the way down with the num i think it
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
was the end of page two
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
the people that are
 
05:21:55.030 --> 05:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
that this applies to it seems like there
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and or or listed after each one of those
 
05:21:59.520 --> 05:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
and or or listed after each one of those
people

05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:22:03.430 --> 05:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
it seems impossible for you for someone
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
all of those but
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
it lists
 
05:22:11.430 --> 05:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
it lists one section after another and
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that is how
 
05:22:17.590 --> 05:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
it was originally designed to be written
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
but that's how it comes off that's
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's one problem i have
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
um it also seems to be this is the thing
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
that creates
 
05:22:27.680 --> 05:22:28.868 align:start position:0%
that creates
essentially

05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
a super passport for um
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
for someone that uh i think if you look
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
at number seven or number eight
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
that has uh pending or approved
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
applications for temporary protected
 
05:22:42.000 --> 05:22:43.990 align:start position:0%
applications for temporary protected
status

05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that says
 
05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
05:22:47.120 --> 05:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
what happens
if

05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:22:48.400 --> 05:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
if
the

05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%

does the real id terminate at that point
 
05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
nothing in here

05:23:15.280 --> 05:23:16.470 align:start position:0%
of the people
nothing

05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
nothing in the bill

tell us the full story as far as i can
see

05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
and yet we would be giving essentially
 
05:23:28.150 --> 05:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
a passport that can be used for any
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%

voting
 
05:23:40.470 --> 05:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's um
 
05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
traveling across the country all of
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
those things are possible
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
with this real id and
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons and many others
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%

committee the day we heard this
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in this bill and and i recall
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
05:24:13.110 --> 05:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that um
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this legislation it
 
05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
would violate the current real id
 
05:24:17.680 --> 05:24:18.948 align:start position:0%
would violate the current real id
um

05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
you know provisions of that law
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
currently so that would be problematic
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%

05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to get
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
registering to vote
 
05:26:03.670 --> 05:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
when they shouldn't be
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
we have almost thirty thousand people
 
05:26:06.628 --> 05:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
who already have driver's licenses here
 
05:26:08.070 --> 05:26:08.080 align:start position:0%

effect

05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
effect
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%

05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
flying for any of those things we have
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand people who aren't going
 
05:26:20.310 --> 05:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to get
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the driver's license that will allow
 
05:26:21.840 --> 05:26:22.868 align:start position:0%

them

05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%

to participate in those activities
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i think just think that didn't come
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
out in the in the testimony and i want
 
05:26:33.190 --> 05:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure you all understand
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are non-citizens who have driver's
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
you representative sex
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the the final point that i would
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
like to make is that
 
05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing there was some
 
05:26:52.150 --> 05:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
testimony on the part of the dmv
 
05:26:52.160 --> 05:26:53.270 align:start position:0%
testimony on the part of the dmv
where

05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
later admitted to i heard the person
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
from the dmv and the citizens group who
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
was most interested in this bill
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
the two of them acknowledged that he was
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
in error about some of his testimony and
 
05:27:08.400 --> 05:27:10.310 align:start position:0%
in error about some of his testimony and
that

05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:10.320 --> 05:27:11.190 align:start position:0%
that
this

05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:27:13.590 --> 05:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
the bill as written is just trying to
 
05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
bring us into compliance full compliance
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather than an exception
 
05:27:18.480 --> 05:27:19.670 align:start position:0%
rather than an exception
compliance

05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
05:27:21.990 --> 05:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the real id act that the fed
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal government has written and the
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
reason and the biggest difference is the
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
20 29 000 people that you just heard
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
about this is trying to make it possible
 
05:27:33.190 --> 05:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
for those 29 000 people to get the real
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
id that they are
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise in
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
other states qualified to get and they
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
are again to repeat they're here legally
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're working here
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
they have a driver's license but they
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
can't get the federal id
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
part real id portion of it
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
because of an exception that was granted
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire this is just trying to
 
05:27:55.040 --> 05:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire this is just trying to
fix

05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
fix
 
05:27:59.110 --> 05:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i heard representative crawford first
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone from dmv dmv is
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
here but of the 29 000
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
licenses that are issued are those from
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%

to but as far as i remember just you can
 
05:28:40.548 --> 05:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
shake ahead if i'm wrong as far as i
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
recollect through discussions in the
 
05:28:44.310 --> 05:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
past anybody with a current green card
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
or work visa
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
can get a new hampshire driver's license
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
temporarily it expires when their visa
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
or green card does that's right
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.990 --> 05:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
so these are the requirements from the
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security the
 
05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
united states department of homeland
 
05:29:14.080 --> 05:29:15.910 align:start position:0%
united states department of homeland
security

05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
on december 27
 
05:29:18.400 --> 05:29:20.150 align:start position:0%
on december 27
2020

05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
2020
 
05:29:20.160 --> 05:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
2020
the

05:29:21.190 --> 05:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
real id modernization act became
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
effective and i think this was largely
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood this removed the
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that a separate social
 
05:29:29.680 --> 05:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
requirement that a separate social
security

05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
document be collected did not remove the
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
requirement that a social security
 
05:29:34.798 --> 05:29:35.670 align:start position:0%
requirement that a social security
number

05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
be collected
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
to uh in order to issue a real id
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
compliant license or identification card
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i guess just to nail that home
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
under the paragraph explaining that
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
homeland security has provided a big
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
giant does an applicant still need to
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
provide their social security number
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
when applying for a real id
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes both the real id act and the new
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
regulation require states to collect and
 
05:30:04.310 --> 05:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
retain an individual social security
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
account number during the application
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
process so nsco can remove that
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
requirement and still have real id
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%

05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%

more correctly answer the your your
point

05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
previously it said provides documents
 
05:30:59.040 --> 05:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
previously it said provides documents
required

05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
required to demonstrate identity united
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%

number and new hampshire residency
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
social security numbers stricken out
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it's i guess it's no longer a
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.590 --> 05:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
well they're looking anybody else from
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
i do have a question
 
05:31:32.240 --> 05:31:33.270 align:start position:0%
i do have a question
sure

05:31:33.270 --> 05:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:31:39.910 --> 05:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
i know that um
 
05:31:46.150 --> 05:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
some of these 29 000 people can in fact
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
get their social security number
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
if the language were changed by an
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
amendment would that be something that
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
would change anybody's mind
 
05:31:58.230 --> 05:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
because i i acknowledge the there's an
 
05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
error there that shouldn't
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to
 
05:32:01.920 --> 05:32:02.708 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to
go

05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
away from
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
federal requirements we're trying to
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
match federal requirements
 
05:32:08.718 --> 05:32:10.470 align:start position:0%
match federal requirements
and

05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
we did ask for a further opinion from
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
the dmv but they they didn't get back to
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
us in time for this hearing
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the indulgence of the
 
05:32:19.680 --> 05:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the indulgence of the
committee

05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to i could
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
basically ask for a straw poll right if
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
i take that out we fix that with an
 
05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
admittedly will take some time will it
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
change anybody's mind and if it won't i
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to work with you guys
 
05:32:38.320 --> 05:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to work with you guys
right

05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
i was hoping to get everything done
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
today catching me off guard with that
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
but even if we were to change that error
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about the 29 000 people
 
05:32:53.040 --> 05:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about the 29 000 people
um

05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
say that was fixed it would still be
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
eligible or the difference of the 29 000
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
if some of them could get a social
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
security number
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
can but there's still a lot of people
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
what scares me the most about this
 
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
is the pending the word pending
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
anybody can come to this country and
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
claim asylum anybody can come to this
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
country and claim temporary protective
 
05:33:15.920 --> 05:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
country and claim temporary protective
status

05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
those are the ones
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
even with a temporary license are still
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
being reviewed and i don't know that we
 
05:33:24.390 --> 05:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
should be giving anybody that's under
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
review for a claim of something until
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's done a driver's license that looks
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
like everybody else's so i still have an
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
issue with it there i'll let anybody
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
else on the committee continue or voice
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
their opinion
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i in addition to
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
that pending um
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
or approved application section
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
i still have a problem knowing what
 
05:33:51.910 --> 05:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
if that application is rejected
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
does that mean you still have
 
05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
someone that's able to drive until the
 
05:34:02.390 --> 05:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
temporary tag is removed is it
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
immediately um
 
05:34:05.280 --> 05:34:06.948 align:start position:0%
immediately um
invalid

05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
invalid
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
and i still haven't heard answers to
 
05:34:09.120 --> 05:34:11.830 align:start position:0%
and i still haven't heard answers to
whether

05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know we just had a bill on driver ed
 
05:34:14.400 --> 05:34:15.430 align:start position:0%
you know we just had a bill on driver ed
that

05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
made people apoplectic and i don't know
 
05:34:17.760 --> 05:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
made people apoplectic and i don't know
why

05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be included in
 
05:34:24.868 --> 05:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation if the idea was to just
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
get to the 29
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
000 people one of which is my 97 year
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
old mother um it would
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
a different bill entirely
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
so if what
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
the representative is suggesting is
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
rewriting the entire bill and just
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with those 29 000 that's a whole
 
05:34:47.110 --> 05:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
different story and we're starting all
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
over again so
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm of the opinion that this is not the
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
bill for those 29 000 but this bill has
 
05:34:59.350 --> 05:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
more problems with it than we can solve
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i also have to look at our
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
deadlines uh again this was the day for
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%

excuse me a motion on the floor in house
 
05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1463 is inexpedient to legislate
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
allows the clerk to call the roll when
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%

05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right the committee recommendation
 
05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
of itl has adopted 10-9 i'm going to
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
close the executive session on house
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
bill 1463
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh next up give us a couple of minutes
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh one six six six i don't think so
 
05:36:39.270 --> 05:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
because it has a floor i acknowledge the
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
floor we don't have the chance to fix it
 
05:36:42.798 --> 05:36:47.270 align:start position:0%
floor we don't have the chance to fix it
is

05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
is it going to be a minority report no
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
that's what yeah
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
the question was if there would be a
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
minority report which was asked of us
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
my answer is that
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
no there won't be a minority report um
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
it can't go on consent obviously because
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm not putting we're not going to
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
put it in a minority report because i
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.430 --> 05:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that we only learned
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
about it at the last possible second
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
but be that as it may um it still needs
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
to be fixed so that we won't argue it
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
on the floor with a minority report
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
fair enough we may argue
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
we may argue it
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor i should say but we're not
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to bother with the minority report
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
say that again we may in fact have you
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
know flight a flight
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about flights here for
 
05:37:35.760 --> 05:37:36.708 align:start position:0%
we're talking about flights here for
people

05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
we may fight it on the floor but we're
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
05:37:42.800 --> 05:37:42.810 align:start position:0%
bother with the minority report
 
05:37:42.810 --> 05:38:24.070 align:start position:0%
bother with the minority report
[Music]

05:38:24.070 --> 05:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to open the
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 1666
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the application process for
 
05:38:31.990 --> 05:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and the privacy of
 
05:38:34.470 --> 05:38:34.480 align:start position:0%

yes i do thank you mr chairman
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
really focuses on our undocumented
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
people and
 
05:38:57.280 --> 05:38:58.150 align:start position:0%
people and
my

05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
i have several concerns with this bill
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
number one
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sharing of information
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
to federal immigration enforcement if in
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
fact it has found that someone
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
is not here legally
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
what this does if we give them license
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
it makes this makes a license a legal
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
document for them
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
05:39:21.990 --> 05:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
will make new hampshire a sanctuary
 
05:39:22.000 --> 05:39:23.430 align:start position:0%
will make new hampshire a sanctuary
state

05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:39:23.440 --> 05:39:24.788 align:start position:0%
state
and

05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know when we look at driver's
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
license driver's licenses is a privilege
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
not a right
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i vote itl for this
 
05:39:34.240 --> 05:39:36.628 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i vote itl for this
bill

05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:39:39.548 --> 05:39:39.558 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:39:43.840 --> 05:39:44.868 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about what this bill does
 
05:39:49.110 --> 05:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
do and what it does not do
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is
 
05:39:51.360 --> 05:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is
um

05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
the the passage of this bill as it's
 
05:39:59.440 --> 05:40:00.390 align:start position:0%
the the passage of this bill as it's
written

05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:40:01.830 --> 05:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
would remove
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
what i call an unnecessary burden of law
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the criminal justice
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
system for the state this is a federal
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
immigration problem that the federal
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
government should be dealing with
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
interposing state
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
into this into this
 
05:40:20.080 --> 05:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
into this into this
equation

05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
equation
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
is uh to my mind a bit of a problem and
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's also very important that
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
people realize that
 
05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
if a person comes here and they have no
 
05:40:29.600 --> 05:40:31.190 align:start position:0%
if a person comes here and they have no
documentation

05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
it is a violation
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a criminal matter it's a civil
 
05:40:36.480 --> 05:40:37.830 align:start position:0%
it's not a criminal matter it's a civil
matter

05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so there should be a separation of
 
05:40:41.430 --> 05:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
these things
 
05:40:41.440 --> 05:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
these things
secondly

05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
and more importantly
 
05:40:45.910 --> 05:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
what we're really trying to do with this
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard from
 
05:40:51.680 --> 05:40:52.548 align:start position:0%
i've heard from
folks

05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
in this room today how important it is
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
that people get their driver's licenses
 
05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
after testing
 
05:41:02.310 --> 05:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
after after passing a written test and
 
05:41:04.150 --> 05:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
passing a
 
05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
driver's test and i absolutely agree
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
and this would make possible for the
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand people who are here
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
undocumented again a civil violation it
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
would make it possible for them
 
05:41:17.040 --> 05:41:18.548 align:start position:0%
would make it possible for them
to

05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
take that test
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
be proven to be
 
05:41:22.240 --> 05:41:23.110 align:start position:0%
be proven to be
good

05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
safe drivers
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that local
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
police departments
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
almost all of them are engaged in an
 
05:41:32.878 --> 05:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
almost all of them are engaged in an
effort

05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
to improve their community relations to
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
get better policing models in place
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then be able to talk to the people
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
who live in their neighborhoods
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
when you don't have a driver's license
 
05:41:52.470 --> 05:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
that one really big important way that
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
people can talk to their police
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
departments is when they as when they've
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
seen them out
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
having a driver's license so that if
 
05:42:01.750 --> 05:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
they asked who they are they can prove
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they can prove where they live
 
05:42:07.110 --> 05:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
and they can talk to police departments
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
is an important goal for public policy
 
05:42:12.470 --> 05:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
public policy for safety sake public
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
support within the law enforcement
 
05:42:20.868 --> 05:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
community for and also for them to make
 
05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
open roads for them so they can talk to
 
05:42:26.230 --> 05:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
all the people and who live in their
 
05:42:26.240 --> 05:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
all the people and who live in their
communities

05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
it will
 
05:42:31.280 --> 05:42:32.548 align:start position:0%
it will
furthermore

05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
05:42:32.558 --> 05:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
furthermore
allow

05:42:33.510 --> 05:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
to positively identify the driver
 
05:42:39.830 --> 05:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that's an important
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the most important points
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
of getting a driver's license with that
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive is it also identifies
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
who that person is
 
05:42:50.708 --> 05:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's effective for regulation of motor
 
05:42:50.718 --> 05:42:51.670 align:start position:0%
it's effective for regulation of motor
vehicle

05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
05:42:51.680 --> 05:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
vehicle
operators

05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
clearly it's safer i think we all agree
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
that if you take a test
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
written and practical and prove that you
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
can drive
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
is that's an important thing
 
05:43:07.590 --> 05:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
it also allows people who are currently
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
driving let's make no mistake there are
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
people driving in this state who do not
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license
 
05:43:15.910 --> 05:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
it makes it possible for them to get
 
05:43:18.150 --> 05:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
insurance as well which is good for
 
05:43:18.160 --> 05:43:19.350 align:start position:0%
insurance as well which is good for
everybody

05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:43:21.430 --> 05:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's good for business it's good for the
 
05:43:23.590 --> 05:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
motoring public it's good for you if you
 
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
get involved in a a crash with somebody
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have a driver's license and
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
they flee that's
 
05:43:29.680 --> 05:43:30.390 align:start position:0%
they flee that's
just

05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
a bad thing and we can take away a lot
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
of these problems
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
this is a law that's effective this is a
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
law that
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
the like of which is effective in 17
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
other states
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that's all
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
happened quite recently
 
05:43:50.470 --> 05:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
and of those 17 states some of them are
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
for example most recently massachusetts
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
did so because of the strong support of
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement community
 
05:43:59.280 --> 05:44:00.548 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement community
vermont

05:44:00.548 --> 05:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
new york
 
05:44:01.600 --> 05:44:02.788 align:start position:0%
new york
connecticut

05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
they all have similar laws
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
allowing undocumented individuals to
 
05:44:07.840 --> 05:44:08.788 align:start position:0%
allowing undocumented individuals to
be

05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
shown and proven to be
 
05:44:10.638 --> 05:44:11.590 align:start position:0%
shown and proven to be
safe

05:44:11.590 --> 05:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
safe
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:17.670 --> 05:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
and again i just want to remind you
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
again being undocumented is not a
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
criminal matter it's a civil matter
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
but when they drive and don't have a
 
05:44:26.788 --> 05:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
driver's license under our current law
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal matter not a civil
 
05:44:29.200 --> 05:44:30.310 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal matter not a civil
matter

05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to take away some of
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
these problems
 
05:44:34.080 --> 05:44:34.868 align:start position:0%
these problems
make

05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
more fully integrated into the community
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
and leave the immigration law problem to
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
the feds where it most proper
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
further thoughts from the committee
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr chairman
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's still the same issue that we ran
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the real id driver's license that
 
05:45:07.750 --> 05:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
section is in here saying that
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
an applicant for a driver's license who
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
has not previously been licensed to
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
drive a motor vehicle in this state
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
shall provide his or her social security
 
05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
number in the application if applying
 
05:45:21.990 --> 05:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
for a real id driver's license
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
if the applicant is applying for a
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
non-real id then he or she may opt out
 
05:45:29.990 --> 05:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
of social security not really sure it's
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
the same problem but we still have real
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
id mentioned in this bill as as one of
 
05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
this this seems always to have been
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
getting around or ignoring
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
federal law and and that seems to be um
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
my problem with it more than anything
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
else um
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
it it seems to say
 
05:45:59.830 --> 05:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
those people that you would like to get
 
05:46:02.310 --> 05:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
the driver's license
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say in here that they that
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
they are required to take drivers tests
 
05:46:07.440 --> 05:46:08.390 align:start position:0%
they are required to take drivers tests
or

05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:13.990 --> 05:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't see that i may be
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
wrong um
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
but i also think that there is a it it
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
05:46:22.788 --> 05:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
what information is needed to get the
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
driver to get the the license um i
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see that it would be that they
 
05:46:30.830 --> 05:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be taking the driver's exam
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
um and i also didn't i i
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
never fully understood and it wasn't
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought up in testimony
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
but we did have people testifying here
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
that needed an interpreter
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
and and i'm wondering i've never
 
05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
understood how we were able to get by
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
drivers um um
 
05:46:50.638 --> 05:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
drivers um um
signs

05:46:51.830 --> 05:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
signs
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
i i have an australian mom who has no
 
05:46:56.548 --> 05:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
idea what some of these signs are saying
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly so i'm not sure how
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
that works but the part of getting
 
05:47:02.788 --> 05:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
around the federal laws is the part that
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative hill for the points that
 
05:47:14.708 --> 05:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
you're making um
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
first things first
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
i've driven in probably
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
14 different countries
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't speak 14 different languages
 
05:47:26.868 --> 05:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
i do speak three
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
but i've driven in places where i do not
 
05:47:30.240 --> 05:47:32.070 align:start position:0%
but i've driven in places where i do not
necessarily

05:47:32.070 --> 05:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
05:47:32.080 --> 05:47:33.270 align:start position:0%
necessarily
speak

05:47:33.270 --> 05:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
or read or write the language but can
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
still drive quite safely and probably
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
could have hadn't tried to but you
 
05:47:41.830 --> 05:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
probably could pass the test i think
 
05:47:44.708 --> 05:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
that's you know really happens
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
much more frequently than and people
 
05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
realize secondly
 
05:47:52.470 --> 05:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing mentioned in here about
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
the driving license test because
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's not in the part of the bill that of
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
the laws that we're amending the the
 
05:48:03.190 --> 05:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for taking the driver's test
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
both written and practical is elsewhere
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
where this fits in
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:12.000 --> 05:48:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.030 --> 05:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
immigration problems
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
well let me let me rephrase it this way
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
05:48:25.120 --> 05:48:27.350 align:start position:0%
i believe
that

05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
it is incumbent upon this state
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to deal with those problems
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
for which we are able to deal with
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
now there are some constitutionally
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
which we can't take up
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
more appropriately the federal
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
government's responsibility
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
where it is a state responsibility and
 
05:48:47.910 --> 05:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
driver licensure is strictly a state
 
05:48:47.920 --> 05:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
driver licensure is strictly a state
responsibility

05:48:49.750 --> 05:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
it should be the kind of questions that
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
we answer
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we answer those to make
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
our citizens in this state
 
05:49:01.190 --> 05:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
as well as people who are just visiting
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
or living here
 
05:49:02.638 --> 05:49:03.990 align:start position:0%
or living here
safer

05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
safer
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that's what this is
 
05:49:08.548 --> 05:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
about this is about public safety making
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
it safer for people it's not an
 
05:49:10.558 --> 05:49:12.310 align:start position:0%
it safer for people it's not an
immigration

05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
it's not there's no attempt here to
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned this bill will make the
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
road safer
 
05:49:30.310 --> 05:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
you may be right because for an hour we
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
listened in our public hearing that in
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact uh that they may be
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
here illegally
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
they came to this country and they have
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
every right to
 
05:49:41.430 --> 05:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh in spite of the law and they are
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
currently driving
 
05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
in spite of the law and it's up to us
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
now to change that
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i disagree with with the with the
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
whole premise
 
05:49:49.680 --> 05:49:50.708 align:start position:0%
whole premise
um

05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:50.718 --> 05:49:51.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
you're saying the roads are more
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
dangerous because the people that are
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be here who are driving
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
on the roads are driving anyway
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for that anybody else from the
 
05:50:00.240 --> 05:50:01.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for that anybody else from the
committee

05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
05:50:06.390 --> 05:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i i'm not sure who i address the
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
question too if it's
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative sykes or the chairman but
 
05:50:10.558 --> 05:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
representative sykes or the chairman but
um

05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:11.520 --> 05:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
um
if

05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
these people are undocumented and by all
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
admissions i guess they are
 
05:50:18.948 --> 05:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
how do we even know who they are to
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
apply let them apply for a driver's
 
05:50:20.958 --> 05:50:21.910 align:start position:0%
apply let them apply for a driver's
license

05:50:21.910 --> 05:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
how is that verified if they don't have
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
a passport
 
05:50:25.280 --> 05:50:26.230 align:start position:0%
a passport
uh

05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
some of the birth certificates some
 
05:50:28.320 --> 05:50:29.910 align:start position:0%
some of the birth certificates some
other

05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:50:32.548 --> 05:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
certification of who they actually are
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
why would we want to give them a
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license and what would the
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
purpose be
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
if those
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
names are not factual
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
i can answer that mr chairman if it's
 
05:50:43.040 --> 05:50:44.470 align:start position:0%
i can answer that mr chairman if it's
allowable

05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:50:45.440 --> 05:50:48.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representatives

05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
within this bill
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
there's a list of documents that will
 
05:50:55.030 --> 05:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
achieve the following purposes
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
that we need to see in a driver's
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
license they will prove one
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
that they are of a proper age to drive
 
05:51:06.548 --> 05:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
two that they are who they are that the
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%

clerk
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
is that person
 
05:51:13.830 --> 05:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
and three it will prove that they
 
05:51:13.840 --> 05:51:15.190 align:start position:0%
and three it will prove that they
reside

05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
reside
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
05:51:18.480 --> 05:51:19.190 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
and

05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
those three things are what driver's
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
licenses are supposed to do they're
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to prove age
 
05:51:27.120 --> 05:51:29.430 align:start position:0%
supposed to prove age
residency

05:51:29.430 --> 05:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
residency
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i lost my the third one there but i
 
05:51:34.390 --> 05:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
you you hear my point it's built into
 
05:51:36.390 --> 05:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
the law representative
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
it'll achieve all of those things that
 
05:51:41.430 --> 05:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
you would like to see achieved
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative crawford
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
is there anyone
 
05:51:50.788 --> 05:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
on this committee who was here i think
 
05:51:52.548 --> 05:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
before covid
 
05:51:56.070 --> 05:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
that remembers um
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
director burlecki testifying on a bill
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is very similar to this
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
if not almost the same bill yeah
 
05:52:04.390 --> 05:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually i
 
05:52:06.470 --> 05:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
i could answer them too
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
two ways
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative crawford for
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
that question because it reminds me of
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
something a point that i forgot to make
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is true that two years ago
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
director bolecki raised some objections
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
to portions of the bill that i had
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
introduced at that point
 
05:52:24.470 --> 05:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
they were corrected to the best of our
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
ability within this bill
 
05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it is of interest to me and i'm not
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you might remember during public
 
05:52:34.470 --> 05:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
testimony for this this bill
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
the dmv had no
 
05:52:38.470 --> 05:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
testimony to give
 
05:52:40.470 --> 05:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
um i i don't want to speak to their
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
motives because that's unfair
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
but i think it is telling that they did
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
not have any objections this time
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
they did not say they supported it
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
either so i believe we made some
 
05:52:53.830 --> 05:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
important corrections
 
05:52:53.840 --> 05:52:55.030 align:start position:0%
important corrections
to

05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
final thoughts
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
role as soon as she's ready the motion
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
vice chairman gagne
 
05:53:15.280 --> 05:53:16.470 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
i wrote this one down so driver's
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
licenses and ids cards are useful to
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
create an appearance
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
of lawful presence and serve as the
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
virtual passport to the nation
 
05:55:48.070 --> 05:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
opening many doors that would otherwise
 
05:55:49.830 --> 05:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
be unavailable
 
05:55:52.470 --> 05:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
granting a driver's license or an id
 
05:55:56.390 --> 05:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
card to those here illegally treats them
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
as they are lawfully present
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
in the united states and facilitates
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
further illegal conduct i believe it is
 
05:56:06.150 --> 05:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
bad public policy and undermines the
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
purposes and objectives of federal
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
immigration law and for these reasons i
 
05:56:11.200 --> 05:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
immigration law and for these reasons i
suggest

05:56:12.470 --> 05:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
05:56:14.948 --> 05:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
we vote itl

are here legally
 
05:56:29.910 --> 05:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's the section license for
 
05:56:31.430 --> 05:56:31.440 align:start position:0%

05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
and they're here legally with a pending
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%

05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
with a pending application and i will
 
05:56:46.868 --> 05:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
then defer to represent psych sorry
 
05:56:49.190 --> 05:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:56:51.030 --> 05:56:51.040 align:start position:0%

so
 
05:56:54.470 --> 05:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
actually former dmv director belecki and
 
05:56:58.240 --> 05:56:59.030 align:start position:0%
actually former dmv director belecki and
i

05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:57:01.270 --> 05:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
wrote together to try and fix a
 
05:57:01.280 --> 05:57:02.788 align:start position:0%
wrote together to try and fix a
technical

05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
technical
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
what we both viewed as a
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
as a flaw in the the dmv laws
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
the issue is this
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
a person who enters the united states
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
and enters so
 
05:57:17.830 --> 05:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
as a legal
 
05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
entry into this country
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
may have
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
a visa for instance one example is a
 
05:57:26.948 --> 05:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
tourist visa they may come in on a
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
tourist visa but they're fleeing
 
05:57:30.628 --> 05:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
violence in their country or some other
 
05:57:30.638 --> 05:57:32.708 align:start position:0%
violence in their country or some other
reason

05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
drug warlords
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
civil war
 
05:57:37.830 --> 05:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
real war
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
but they're here and they're here
 
05:57:39.520 --> 05:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
but they're here and they're here
legally

05:57:42.150 --> 05:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
but they cannot drive because if you
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:57:48.070 --> 05:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
tourist visa you are prohibited under
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law from getting a
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
05:57:51.920 --> 05:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
driver's license
however

05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:57:54.480 --> 05:57:55.590 align:start position:0%
however
once

05:57:55.590 --> 05:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
once
 
05:57:59.910 --> 05:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
a clock
 
05:58:01.120 --> 05:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
a clock
starts

05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
starts
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
and under new hampshire law
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you have a work permit
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
you can then successfully apply for take
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
the written and
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
practical exam and get a driver's
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
license that's current law right now if
 
05:58:19.030 --> 05:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
you get a work permit you can take your
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
driver's test and get a driver's license
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
the problem is and
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
the federal system is such that it takes
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
forever literally
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
your asylum status resolved
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
the feds recognize this so what they do
 
05:58:39.920 --> 05:58:40.948 align:start position:0%
the feds recognize this so what they do
is

05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:44.310 --> 05:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
if they have if you have not had your
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
pending asylum request hearing
 
05:58:48.718 --> 05:58:49.628 align:start position:0%
pending asylum request hearing
after

05:58:49.628 --> 05:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
365 days after one year you can then
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
apply for and receive
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
a work permit
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then in turn once you have the work
 
05:59:03.990 --> 05:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
permit you can apply for and receive
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
with testing a new hampshire driver's
 
05:59:08.788 --> 05:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
license all of that exists now
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
the time frame when they're living here
 
05:59:17.110 --> 05:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they're here illegally
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
they are required to get a driver new
 
05:59:20.310 --> 05:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license but they
 
05:59:21.910 --> 05:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
cannot because they don't have the work
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
permit and the purpose of the bill is to
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
close the gap
 
05:59:28.708 --> 05:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
between those and give a temporary
 
05:59:28.718 --> 05:59:30.310 align:start position:0%
between those and give a temporary
license

05:59:30.310 --> 05:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the gap time
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
and then they would then come in and it
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
would it would expire
 
05:59:38.240 --> 05:59:39.590 align:start position:0%
would it would expire
after

05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:59:42.470 --> 05:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
i think was a hundred and
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
180 days it would expire
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
but then they will have had time to have
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
gotten their work permit and test and
 
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
get their driver's license that way it's
 
05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
just trying to fill that little gap
 
05:59:56.310 --> 05:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're here legally
 
05:59:58.470 --> 05:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
they get their driver's license the
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license that they get with
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
their work permit which many of these
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
are given out all the time they do have
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
an expiration
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
expire when the work permit expires
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a real world example for this and the
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
person to me known to me
 
06:00:20.080 --> 06:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
person to me known to me
who

06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:00:22.948 --> 06:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
arrived on a
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
tourist visa legally
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
but was fleeing
 
06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
gang violence where he had been
 
06:00:29.520 --> 06:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
gang violence where he had been
kidnapped

06:00:31.510 --> 06:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
kidnapped
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
and was fortunately able to escape and
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
he brought his family out of that
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
country here to the united states
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
he applied for asylum
 
06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
he did not get a driver's license until
 
06:00:45.030 --> 06:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
he got his work permit which was a more
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
than a year later
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
he is still now
 
06:00:51.670 --> 06:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
seven years later
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
still waiting
 
06:00:57.990 --> 06:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
for his asylum request to be answered
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to make
 
06:01:01.190 --> 06:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
possible we're just trying to close that
 
06:01:02.310 --> 06:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
little gap
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
between you arrive you ask for asylum
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you get your
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
work permit the work permit is automatic
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
they get it as soon as
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
the if the feds haven't given them their
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing they get that work permit
 
06:01:18.000 --> 06:01:19.590 align:start position:0%
hearing they get that work permit
automatic

06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that's all i'm trying to do with this
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill it's pretty simple it had the
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
support of the dmv
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
former director we wrote it together so
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
we could close this small gap it's a
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
very narrow
 
06:01:39.750 --> 06:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.590 --> 06:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions or discussion from
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the committee representative corrosion
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess it's one of a
 
06:01:45.600 --> 06:01:46.548 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess it's one of a
question

06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
because in in this proposed legislation
 
06:01:49.520 --> 06:01:50.230 align:start position:0%
because in in this proposed legislation
it

06:01:50.230 --> 06:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:01:51.750 --> 06:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a temporary driver's license
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
for 180 days
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the example that the representative
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
just cited
 
06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
he said
 
06:02:00.150 --> 06:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
seven years later they still don't have
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
that asylum so
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
if this was to pass
 
06:02:06.070 --> 06:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding correctly that they
 
06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
would get a driver's license for 180
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
days and then the remaining several
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
years they wouldn't have one if if they
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't been the asylum hadn't been
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
approved well let me let me put it this
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
book thank you for the question um
 
06:02:17.520 --> 06:02:19.350 align:start position:0%
book thank you for the question um
representative

06:02:19.350 --> 06:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
imagine there's two different drivers
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
licenses one is a temporary that only
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
lasts for the 180 days
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
the next one is
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
temporary but can last indefinitely
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
until the feds
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
that temporary driver's license
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
once you have a work permit is existing
 
06:02:43.590 --> 06:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
law now
 
06:02:45.910 --> 06:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
what doesn't exist is that little gap
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
between when you apply for asylum
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
and you get your work permit
 
06:02:51.670 --> 06:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
automatically that's this is just about
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:58.310 --> 06:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%

06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
they've been trying to get rid of that
 
06:06:18.470 --> 06:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
damn thing for years
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%

06:06:40.948 --> 06:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hope you have the executive
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
session on senate bill 307
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the issuance of safe boater
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
education certificates and commercial
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
driving instruction chair recognizes
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson for a motion
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd like to make a motion to
 
06:06:58.868 --> 06:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
otp on 307. okay uh motion about the
 
06:07:01.830 --> 06:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
pass is there is there a second
 
06:07:04.150 --> 06:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
second by representative gorsky do we
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes um
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think the boating uh
 
06:07:16.390 --> 06:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
part of this is uh
 
06:07:19.830 --> 06:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a no-brainer the uh as far as
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
the commercial driver's licenses go
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
um i think anything we can do to
 
06:07:26.708 --> 06:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
expedite uh
 
06:07:28.628 --> 06:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
more driving more commercial drivers
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state and in the country
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
is probably the best we can do for
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
fair enough any other discussion on
 
06:07:41.110 --> 06:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 307
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd be in support of the otp i
 
06:07:48.150 --> 06:07:48.160 align:start position:0%

06:10:42.480 --> 06:10:43.430 align:start position:0%
how many of these will make it up on the
10th

06:10:43.430 --> 06:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
10th
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh because we're not facing any
 
06:10:45.200 --> 06:10:46.390 align:start position:0%
uh because we're not facing any
deadlines

06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
06:10:58.470 --> 06:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just wanted to clarify that
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
um since we don't have any we don't have
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
any senate bills that have been passed
 
06:11:05.990 --> 06:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
over to us we won't be meeting as a
 
06:11:08.070 --> 06:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee potentially until
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
after crossover in april
 
06:11:12.868 --> 06:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
that is correct we get senate bill 307
 
06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
fast tracked because of the issues with
 
06:11:16.868 --> 06:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
the federal government a lot of change
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
i don't expect to see any more until
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
after crossover so we are technically
 
06:11:24.150 --> 06:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
on committee break yeah until after
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
crossover great i just wanted to confirm
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
