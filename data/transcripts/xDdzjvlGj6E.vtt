00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
unable to serve they were um children of
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
single moms or dads who needed to go to
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
work in person you know to put food on
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
their table like lnas and delivery
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
drivers and grocery store employees they
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
were children with special needs for
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
whom remote therapy just wasn't working
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
at all uh they were M medically fragile
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
children who couldn't go into a
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
classroom setting that the parents had
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
fear that the children would be um in
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
danger in a classroom setting and they
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to stay home and all those people
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
were in addition to our normal kids that
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
we see in any given year usually those
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
are kids that are bullied and need to go
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
to a different School setting they might
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
be kids that are well below grade level
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
and the parent is looking for a smaller
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
class size for them or they might be
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
families with special needs who are just
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of their rope and want to opt
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
to do something completely
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
different um these families are normal
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
families and then we saw all these other
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
families because of the pandemic so it's
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
been a really tough year
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
hb20 gives us the opportunity all of us
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to serve these children
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
and really that's what we're all here
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
for is to serve the children of New
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm just going to point out a
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
couple of things in the bill that I
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
think are of note that haven't been
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
brought up by anyone else um who's been
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
talking about it and that is the the
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
total transparency around the use of the
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
funds it's very clear what you can use
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
it for and it will be very clear in the
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
reporting and accountability what those
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
funds are used for I thought also the
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
fact that it requires a system for
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
rating and reviewing education providers
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's public will be a wonderful piece
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
and service to the state where you can
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
go and see how education providers who
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
they are and what they're doing and what
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
do people think about them I think
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
that's a really important piece of this
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I also um noted that there's
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
auditing of every account and I thought
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
that was a really good piece of this
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill I like how the bill requires the
 
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to use a
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
financial Tech payment platform I know
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
that class wallet is also here today and
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
they are ready to share with you how
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
that works and the accountability and
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
transparency built into that payment
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
platform and the fact that this bill
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
specifies doing something that's
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
familyfriendly and also fraud prevention
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
I think is really important um the fact
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
that the State Board of Ed further after
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill makes the rules I think will
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
make it really clear how to run the
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
program and I appreciate that that is in
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
there I also o um noticed the uh
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
rigorous annual reporting and that
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
there's legislative oversight and that
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
those legislators are elected I thought
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
that elected legislator oversight piece
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this was also good and so for me you
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
know hb20 and education Freedom accounts
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
will give us the opportunity really all
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
of us to serve New Hampshire children
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
who otherwise are struggling and so
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund supports
 
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.949 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund supports
this

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.790 align:start position:0%
this
legislation

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%

I want to ask what type of expenses do
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%

cover thank you so much that's a great
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
question so what we see with our
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
existing we do have almost 200
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers in our current education
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
tax credit scholarship program using a
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
homeschool scholarship and the families
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
I I did I do have a list of that and
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
they have um
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
particularly about 3% spend money on
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
tutoring about 7% spend money on online
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
classes textbooks are about 15% of the
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
purchases um technology Hardware
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks are about eight% of the
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
purchases education therapies about 2%
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
testing fees about
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
5% college classes and again remember
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
you can use this for a college class but
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
only if you haven't graduated from high
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
school yet so these aren't actually
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
college student they're high school
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
students taking a college course and
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
1% um Public School tuition was about 2%
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
so people are buying classes and courses
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
online for example we have a student um
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
in Lowden on a farm who goes to online
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
school at Stanford University he was an
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
advanced child who needed a more
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
accelerated curriculum and so he's
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
technically a homeschooler even though
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
he's a full-time online Schooler and so
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
we see that we see people purchasing
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
courses and classes there are some um
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
co-ops that have opened um there's one
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
in Manchester where families can
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
purchase classes for their homeschool
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
classes there's also a a Learning Center
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
in do called big big fish and I think
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
you actually heard from one of those
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
students um who was on the meeting last
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
time talking about his experience there
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
at bigfish and at big fish is a place
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
where you're a homeschooler but you
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
purchase courses and classes and
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
advising from the school and so we see
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
that um people also do purchase music
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
classes um what else do I see here music
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
lessons learning
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
supplies mad science
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
class so it's been a really fun
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to provide
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
low-income families with this you know
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
sometimes with a homeschooler they're
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
giving up an entire person's income
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
capability to stay home and educate
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
their child and so to be able to help
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
them with these curriculum type things
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
and courses you know I see a New
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history class here to be able
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
to provide that for families is really
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
except ctional and meaningful so thanks
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
Moffett yes
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair thanks than
 
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.350 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair thanks than
my

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to find out how do you
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
see that this bill would
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
impact um minority kids and
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged kids you see that this
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
is we just expand on the idea choice and
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
the charter school already started
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
sure that's a that's a good question so
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
the our existing tax credit program our
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is one of the most
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
diverse programs in the state so while
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
the state percentages are 90% white in
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
10% um people of color our program is
 
00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.269 align:start position:0%
10% um people of color our program is
about

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
78% people that are white and
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
22% um people of color and so we do find
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
that many families come to us because
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
they might be experiencing some form of
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination in their school they tell
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
us um that happens to them they tell us
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
that they experience racism and that's
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
why they come to us and so the fact that
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
a program exists where a family who's
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing something like that can get
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
help I think is really important and so
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
um when you're creating education
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts yes you are creating an
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a family who otherwise
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
is experiencing discrimination to come
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
or bullying um and and go to a school
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
where they want to or a building that's
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
safe for them um there was a gleon
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
report that they put out um that said
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
that LBGTQ CH kids are the most bullied
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
63% of those kids in schools are bullied
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and that is the top reason that
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
people come to us now is because they're
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing bullying or discrimination
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and so putting a program like education
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts into place does
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
directly help those
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
kids thank you very much are there
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
for yeah thank you very much Mr chair um
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
would um um and thank you very much U
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
Miss Baker for um I'm sorry U for taking
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
my um my question no problem just um uh
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
was wondering based on the um the the
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
the estimated um uh State costs that the
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh LBA has um um has put forward how
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
much revenue do the scholarship
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
organizations look to potentially
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
receive as a result of hosal 20 you're
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
asking the administrative cost right now
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
we run between 90 and 94 cents goes to
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
kids so that would be between six and
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
10% of our cost what happens
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative luno is if something is
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
larger it's more efficient when
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
something is smaller it's usually less
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
efficient in the nonprofit space there's
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion around um 10% being
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
kind of the requirement of a baseline
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
for a Federal grant for example to run
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
well they'll say you should use 10% as
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
your Baseline there's some discussion in
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit space also about making
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
sure that you're not being so narrow
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that you don't run well and so we do a
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
really good job currently with that
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
946 um overall at Children's scholarship
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
fund running really efficiently and
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
we'll work to run as efficiently as
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
possible I'm not going to upgrade my
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
Corolla anytime soon I want to be able
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
to send all the money to kids if I can
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
and so we'll run efficiently but that is
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
a really reasonable expectation that
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
some somewhere between 6% and 10% is
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the cost to run the program
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
and that's super efficient and gold
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
standard for nonprofits I know for
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
example Easter Seals in New Hampshire
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
runs 9010 nine 90% goes right to the
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
programs in families and 10% is for
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
their administrative so I feel like
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty reasonable and safe safe
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
guess and and you know I'll run it as
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible for sure if I
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
run this type of
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
program uh followup Mr chair
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
so um so thanks very much for that so
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that would be somewhere between 6 to 10%
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the um $ 74.8 million that the that
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
the LBA has um has looked at I guess I
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a reasonable
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a reasonable
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
projection well it's what they it's what
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
they they emailed me so so in other stes
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
but I've got a question I've got a
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
question I've got a question sorry so
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
question is is would you be interested
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
in learning more about a bill
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
particularly being from Manchester would
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
you be interested in learning more about
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill uh 158 which with with no
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
additional um impact on on property
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
taxes to Manchester um uh property
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would direct um almost that
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
same number close to $80 million in
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
additional State funding to the
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District would you be
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
interested in learning more about that
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
bill I mean I love reading everything
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno and having wonderful
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
conversations I I think that it's
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
families use an education Freedom
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
account it does increase the per pupil
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
money that the district has for all the
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
kids that they have there and so I I
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about apples and
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
oranges I'm not quite sure where you're
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
going with your with your question okay
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah you're welcome uh further
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:03.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
okay um I was wondering
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
how how this is going to avoid the
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
mistakes of Arizona as far as widescreen
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
televisions and stuff like
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
that so Arizona recently in the past two
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
years has moved their families to class
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
wallet and um it's standard now
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
understanding for anyone running these
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
programs Nationwide that that's the way
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
to do it initially Arizona used debit
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
cards where they tried to track spending
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't really make sense using
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
class wallet is really the way to go
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
because every expense can be
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
pre-approved and I know class wallet is
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
here today on this call to show you that
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
so you can see how the expenses are
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
preapproved by a real human instead of
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
being some sort of mechanical and the
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
the platform exists really to do that
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then to report down to the skew so
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
the transparency around that is really
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
good you're going to be able to see down
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the skew what every family does with
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
the money using class wallet and the
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
administrator will be able to
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
pre-approve every expense and there I
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
know class wallet's here to show you
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
that so you'll be able to see that
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
representative today yeah you're
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss Baker for being here
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
my pleasure currently uh the funds
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
you're receiving uh are pre-tax dollars
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh from businesses is that correct you
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
could be now a business um or an
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
individual it's against business profits
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
tax business Enterprise tax and interest
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax so someone makes a
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
donation to the scholarship fund after
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
they've applied to Department of Revenue
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
then they can get the credit after they
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
make the donation but that's the
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
existing mechanism that we have yes HB
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
hb20 is dealing is directly from a
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh money that would go to your
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
state yeah you're talking about the
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
State adequacy dollars following the
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
child wherever they go yeah absolutely

Tanner um thank you for taking my
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
question Miss Baker um I was wondering
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
if you could uh if the giving andg
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
goinging Alliance is that uh is set up
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
by the christiany basically is still
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
part of the children's scholarship
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
fund uh that's a separate organization
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
and they actually don't have any staff
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner so I don't know
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
what their plans are
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
could I have have a followup on that
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
please um
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
so they are though approved to put out
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
these um vouchers as well as the other
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
scholarships yes we do get reapproved
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
every year and so they were approved
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
like we were um at the beginning of the
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to do scholarships for this
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
year but we're all only approved for one
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
year and then we reapply every year base
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
on our compliance with the law and
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
turning in our 05s on time and
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
resubmitting an application so one does
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
get reapproved every fiscal year and do
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know what percentage they
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
take I don't
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
know no I'm sorry I couldn't answer that
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
um who would we contact to find that
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
information out you actually can look at
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
the reports they're on the department of
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
revenues website um if you go to the
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
Department of revenues website and you
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
click on education tax credit you can
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
see all of the public reports that have
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
been published from last this year all
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
the way back to the beginning and so you
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
could really just look at it it's it's
 
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.950 align:start position:0%
could really just look at it it's it's
public

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
information um it does seem like they're
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
part of your organization on the on some
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
of those reports though the ones so I
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
did use to help them in the beginning
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
when the organization started they did
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
not know how to do the work and so I did
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
help them in the beginning to learn to
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
do education tax credit scholarships I
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
mean 77g is also a 11 page law with
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and so I did help them so
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the beginning that we
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
filed reports together but now we've
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point where children's
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund is so large that I
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't have time to help anyone really
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
with anything else at all and they've
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
been able to to run that on their own
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
for years now thank you you're welcome
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%

helpful if we went through some actual
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of of the bill itself many of
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
the speakers uh last week um sort of
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
talked about their own personal
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
experiences and some of the broader
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
policies about um vouchers and
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
privatization so I'm going to walk
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
through some of the language of the bill
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
and and try to identify where there are
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
problems with the with the current
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
language where it may be contradictory
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then wrap that up um with some of
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
the larger policy concerns um of which
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
this bill has has many so I'm on page
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
one um of the bill um page one line 17
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
talks about an educ educational service
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
provider that provides educational
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
materials um educational materials is
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
not further defined um within the bill
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
um there's some stuff on page two um
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
that I'll get to in a little bit that
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
talks about tuition and tutoring um but
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
education materials is is is about as
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
broad-based of phrase as we could
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
possibly get um I'd like to know who
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%

just want to make sure I'm clear when it
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
says a resident of the state who was
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to enroll in a public
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
enrollement um in a public elementary or
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
secondary school so we're talking about
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
180,000 kids um that would potentially
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
be available for um this voucher this
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
this handout um of about $4 or $5,000
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
hours per person um I know they'll be
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
going to committee and fiscal notes so
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into that but I
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're clear
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
that it's every kid that that's eligible
 
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
to attend public school is about 170
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
180,000 kids in the state um the other
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
question about that uh the definition of
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
an eligible student I'm on page one line
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
26 it says um you know eligible student
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
including a sibling of a student with a
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
with an education Freedom account um
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
does that sibling also have to be a
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire and meet the
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
initial criteria I don't think that's
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
very clear um because it's quite
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
possible um that we have siblings of
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
students um who live in a different
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
state dad may live in in in Dover or
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
summersworth with one child and mom may
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
live in Berwick or South Berwick Maine
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
with another child um we have families
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
with with stepchildren and and half
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
brothers and half siblings that from my
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
own experience may live in various parts
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
of the state or various parts of of of
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
of Maine or New Hampshire or
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I are we expanding that
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
to any sibling regardless of where they
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
live or does that sibling also have to
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
be a New Hampshire
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
resident definition um page one line 30
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
fulltime means more than 50% of
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
instructional time um 50% of what is
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
that a school day is that a a
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling day is that a a school day
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
based on the the the resident District's
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
hours um it's sort of using the phrase
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
instructional time is also
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive to the Competency Based
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
education system um that New Hampshire
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
has been moving towards for the last 10
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
or 12 years where we're not counting
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
seat time to earn credits we're talking
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
about competencies and Mastery of
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
competencies so I'm not sure what um you
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure what instructional
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
time means um does that mean that they
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
have to BU adhere by the minimum
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
standards which require 9990 hours for
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
high school over the course of a year
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
and less for for elementary schools um
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
I'm moving on to page two um line one um
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
a person where the student or the
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
educator are not physically present in
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
the traditional classroom I don't know
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
what traditional classroom means um when
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
you tell me a traditional classroom are
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
we talking about a little two two room
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse and in the mountains um or
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
are we talking about um you know uh the
 
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
are we talking about um you know uh the
latest

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
latest
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
um classrooms in in Dover High School
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
which was just built two or three years
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
ago so I don't know what that means um
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
I'm on page two now continuing down um
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
talking about some of the the qualifying
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
expenses um I'm looking um I'm on sub
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph D this is line 19 says
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
Services contracted for and provided by
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
a public school district Charter Public
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
School public Academy including but not
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
limited to individual classes curricular
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
activities and programs one of the great
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
ironies with this bill is that public
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
schools provide these services for free
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
um and now we're giving money away to
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
parents to turn around and Reby them it
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're going to be paying for
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
the same Services twice whether or not
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's uh Educational Services Physical
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
Therapy special education services but
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
the services are are essentially if if
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to a public school and you
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
need those Services guess what parents
 
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay for them
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
um continuing down I'm on page line P
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
again page two line 25 of paragraph F
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
computer hardware internet connectivity
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
and other technological services and
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
devices that are used to help meet the
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
students educational
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
needs I'm going to try and not get testy
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
but this is a little bit insulting
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
considering that we have a lot of
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
schools that are still going remote and
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
when those children needed desk when
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
those children needed laptops and
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
devices it was the public schools that
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
paid for them and it was the public
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
schools that worked with the internet
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
service companies to try and get
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
internet out there um you know and how
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
about our teachers there's nothing in
 
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
law that requires a teacher has a laptop
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
or the internet at home but yet we know
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
our teachers were providing remote
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
instruction for the last 10 months and
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
are continuing to do so so if a kid
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
needs a computer and his rolled in the
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
public school um especially in times of
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
a pandemic and especially in times when
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're changing educational
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
models to meet the needs of kids
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
again local taxpayers are paying for
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
that the state isn't paying for that
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers are paying for that and
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
now we're giving them additional money
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
to go buy these sorts of things
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
um uh line 27 on page two educational
 
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
software and
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
applications is that education
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
applications or just applications
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
there'll be paying for Angry Birds um
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
and and and games to play I don't I
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
either um line 32 tuition or fees or
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
other summer education programs what's
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
an educational program is that any sort
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
of summer camp does there have to be a
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum for a summer camp does it
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
have to relate to reading wrath and
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
reading um writing and arithmetic again
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's vague and and and if not who
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
decides who decides if it's if it's an
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
educational summer program is it the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is it some
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
level of oversight by the department of
 
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.750 align:start position:0%
level of oversight by the department of
educ

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
educ
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
um these are all continuing questions
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill that simply don't have any
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
answers I'm moving on to page three um
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh line two again these are some of the
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
things that you can pay for fees for
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
transportation pay to a fee for service
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
TR uh Transportation provider for the
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
student to travel to and from an
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
educational Ser service provider again
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
these are paid for by public schools
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
already if a child needs to get on a bus
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
to go receive some sort of special
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
services um public schools are already
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
paying for that so again this is just
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
another example where if we're giving
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
out free money giving out a voucher to
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
people we're going to be paying for the
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
same service twice um that does not seem
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
like an efficient way to be spending
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money uh all the other things
 
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.550 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money uh all the other things
um

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
to the things I talked about these these
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
qualifying educational expenses um one
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
of the larger concerns nhba has with
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
this B bill is whether or not these
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers are required
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
to undergo criminal background checks
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
the same way um anybody that steps into
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
a public school to provide Education
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
Services is required to undergo a
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
criminal background check um further um
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
are they going to be required to adhere
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the the teacher or the educator code
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
of conduct that the Department of
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
Education um the state board has adopted
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago now I I understand
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the depart Department's really only
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
role is to cover certified Educators if
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
you hold a credential from the
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
Department um but it seems that if we're
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
going to be giving State money um to
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
these other education service providers
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
that they should at least be held to the
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
same standards at least as it comes to
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
child safety criminal background checks
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think is that much to ask and
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
adhering to um a code of conduct I don't
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
think is too much to ask
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
either um page three line 13 this is
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
where it says that the the EF F does not
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
constitute taxable income to the parent
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
I is that allowed some we need to check
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
with a tax attorney or the IRS on that I
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if a state statute can can
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
dictate what constitutes income and what
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
does not constitute income I presume
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
that that's a a federal is issue under
 
00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:44.910 align:start position:0%
that that's a a federal is issue under
IRS

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
IRS
 
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.910 align:start position:0%
IRS
regulations

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm moving on to page
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
four um I'm online um
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh 17 I I this may be covered this may
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
not be covered elsewhere in the bill um
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
it talks about enrolling a full-time
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
student in the Resident School District
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
shall result in immediate suspension of
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
payment of additional funds um and if I
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
missed it maybe it isn't here but the
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
larger question is what happens to sort
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
of these unexpended funds does it is it
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
return back to the state does it go to
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
the school district where the the the
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
child resides who's receiving the the
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
voucher or I don't know does it stay
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
with a scholarship organization in their
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
account does it get back sent sent back
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
to the state or does it get sent to the
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
local school district if I miss that I
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's certainly a
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
has um moving on um I'm on page six line
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
seven says if an EFA student is free
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
from personal misconduct that student
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
shall be eligible for an EFA in the
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
future I don't know what that means by
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
personal misconduct um anybody with
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who has kids knows that um kids
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
are not free from personal
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
misconduct um which is why they're kids
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it's why it's responsibility of the
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
parents to to make sure that they're not
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
but I mean does that mean that the kid
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
had was suspended at a school does it
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
mean he got detention I don't I don't
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
know what that
 
00:40:22.359 --> 00:40:24.030 align:start position:0%
know what that
means

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
um uh continuing up on um line 32 on
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
page six the scholarship organization
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
May adopt policies or procedures um it
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
seems that a sha would make more sense
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
there um it's also peculiar though that
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
we're putting sort of Ru making
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
Authority into the hands of of a private
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
entity um question the oversight um of
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
of of the scholarship organization
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
creating its own rules to run
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
itself um also on P this is on page six
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
and the top of page 7 I'm at line 36 on
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
page six um it says the scholarship
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
organization shall not include
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
discriminate against or otherwise
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantage any educational provider so
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
on and so forth with respect to the
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
religious character and
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
affiliation um including mission-based
 
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.710 align:start position:0%
affiliation um including mission-based
practices

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
um by carving out the religious
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
exception in that line you're saying
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization can
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate for other basis um if
 
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
you're if if you don't want the
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to discriminate
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
on any basis then you should then that
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
then that should be it um but by carving
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
out the religious carve out there I
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
think I think the implication is that
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
they can discriminate for other
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
purposes uh page seven line four uh the
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization and any
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
contractors shall comply with all
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
federal state laws regarding student
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
privacy um I I I I I'm not sure what
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
they mean by contractors are contractors
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
the service providers or are they
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
contractors that the the the the the
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization as a corporate
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
entity uses um the other challenge with
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
that just before the contractors and the
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization sort of jump
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
both feet in with respect to House Bill
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
20 um I'm going to interpret that as
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
meeting the scholarship organization any
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
contractors which I'm going to interpret
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
as as education service providers
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
um at this point need to comply with
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
1612 um the cost time effort and
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
expertise that needed to um uh implement
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
the provisions of House Bill 1612 for
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
the newer members that was a very
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
significant data privacy bill um uh
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative cordelli in
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
2018 I believe that was Sir and um nhba
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
was happy to help with representative
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
Cordell and house at in full legislature
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
to provide multiple uh training
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities and webinars and in-person
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
trainings for House Bill 12 but
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
um it was quite an effort school
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
districts are still um I think getting
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
up to speed on that but it was timely it
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
was costly it was expensive um so I just
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're clear that
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations and
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
contractors which may or may not include
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
the education service providers are also
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
required to comply with house B
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh um so page8 line
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
20 Education Service Providers shall be
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
given maximum freedom to provide for the
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
educational needs of vfa students
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
without government control I I think
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
that this really sort of sums up House
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 and and all the other voucher
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
bills we're giving away money and
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
oversight uh I would think that if we're
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
giving away State money public money um
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know adequacy grants uh that there
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
should be some level of government
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
control and governmental
 
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.710 align:start position:0%
control and governmental
oversight

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so those those are just some of the
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
highlights nhsda has identified um with
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
the bill there are some of the larger
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
policy concerns that nsba has the fiscal
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
note I know that the LBA did a fiscal
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
note the department did a fiscal note
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
reaching higher New Hampshire did a
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm not going to get into
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
the nitty-gritty of of of of those
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
people are going to believe what they
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
want to believe but at its most base
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
level if we're talking about 15 or
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
20,000 kids that are currently in
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
private schools and homeschooling right
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
now and and not even even if not a
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
single child in in currently enrolled in
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
public schools access this um we've got
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
about 20,000 kids in home schools and
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
and and private schooling I believe or
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
some of the the enrollment numbers
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
that's $80 million price tag just on
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
that um um remind you that we're arguing
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
over $50 million for school building Aid
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
when we know that the department has
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
reported that um you know building aid
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
needs across the state are about a
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
billion dollars um it seems odd that we
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
just want to you give away that much
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
money and we said without any government
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
oversight or control is the bill notes
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect to which I think is
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
concerning is that there's no
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
requirement these that these Education
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
Service Providers be New Hampshire
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
corporations so we could be giving a
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
voucher um for a kid to be go to school
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
out of state it seems that the very
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
least is a policy um standpoint the
 
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
committee might want to make sure that
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
state money is being spent in state for
 
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
state money is being spent in state for
state

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
students um and and last there's there's
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
two one aspect um one word that gets
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
floated around a lot with respect to to
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
these bills um and I'd like to provide a
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
little context and Clarity to that um
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
the word is accountability um we know
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
that you know uh opponents of House Bill
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
20 have said there's a lack of
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
accountability proponents of House Bill
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
20 have said that you know parents are
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know accountable for the
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
education of their child and school
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
districts are accountable to parents and
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth there's two kinds of
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
accountability that we're talking about
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
the first is going to what I'm going to
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
call Little a accountability in the
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
sense that school boards are accountable
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers school boards are
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
accountable to the parents and the
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
children that are within their District
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
um you know anybody time we're spending
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
public money we're account accountable
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
to the public that level of
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
accountability what opponents of House
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 when when opponents of House
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 speak about accountability this
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
is big a accountability and that's the
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
requirements um both found in statute
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rules and the
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution that there be
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
an accountability system within our
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
public education that accountability
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
system is the Statewide assessment um
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
we've we've had some conversations about
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
the input-based accountability system
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
and the output based accountability
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
system on some of the other bills this
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
session um that's the accountability
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's lacking from this bill um our
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
public schools are required to file all
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of accountability um reports with
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and and why
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
do they have to do that because it's
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
state money and if you're taking State
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
money certain strings come attached with
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
that so I just want to I wanted to
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
clarify that for the committee when
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
accountability in the educational
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
context we're not talking about the
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
little a accountability where school
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
boards are accountable to parents and
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
school boards are accountable to
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and things of that
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
accountability General accountability
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking big a accountability which
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
the law already requires public schools
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
that there be an accountability piece to
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
an adequate education um so I I I hope
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
that helps clarify sort of what we're
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
talking about with the the
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
accountability aspect um accountability
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
is a general adequacy um requirement um
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
you know minimum standards uh flow with
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
that um so I guess we Circle back around
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the argument that if if if if it's if
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's too much accountability in
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
public schools and too many standards
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
for public schools and that is somehow
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
inhibiting public schools from serving
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
all the children then let's focus on on
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
on where those standards are and what
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature can do to perhaps
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of them um but anyway
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up my testimon I I I thank you
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
for indulging me uh nsba is is firmly
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill um the language of
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
the statute itself uh has a lot of holes
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
in it and then we have the broader
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
policy concerns which um which we don't
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
think makes for a good bill either and
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh ver for
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
your detailed presentation here uh are
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
you to questions happy to answer any
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
questions sir thank you
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
question opponent frequently say that
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
the students leave due to
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
the to raise property taxes that mean if
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
they gain students they would cut
 
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.150 align:start position:0%
they gain students they would cut
property

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
taxes I I I miss part of that
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative B I just want to make
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
sure you said it uh opponents of voucher
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
bills claim that if students leave the
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
school property taxes will go up but if
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
they come back into the school property
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
taxes will go down was that was that the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
general question General also if
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
students come into the school from other
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
reasons uh
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's lose students property taxes goes
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
up gain students property taxes go up
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
heads they win Tails they lose so case
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
where taxes would go down well thank you
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I I
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have a clear answer for
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
that but I will tell you that Manchester
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
has the lowest cost per pupil in the
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
state and I think that's because they
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
have the most kids um you know I'm I'm
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
not a a I'm not a a statistician by any
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
means but we know that you know a child
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
in and a child out um you know doesn't
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
change your tax rate one bit to some
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
degree these are economies of scale if
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
you have a large District such as
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester you can have a lower cost per
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
pupil conversely if you have a small
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
student population like say Waterville
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
Valley their cost per pupil is $3 or
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
$40,000 because you're only 10 or 15
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
kids that live there whatever the
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
numbers are so I don't know if that
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
answered your question but um I think
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's the best I can I can provide for
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Miler uh thank you Mr
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Christina for
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm referring to your
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
comment on page
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
seven uh line
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
four uh do you find it strange that that
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
language that the contractors have to
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
comply with federal and state laws
 
00:50:57.559 --> 00:50:58.870 align:start position:0%
comply with federal and state laws
regarding

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
privacy but not regarding
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination um thank you for the
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
question representative um you know that
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's also a significant concern of of
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
of opponents um who uh opponents of of
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
voucher bills in general um you know I I
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
I liken this to sort of uh you know a
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
Federal grant if you will anytime
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's a Federal Grant and I'm imagine
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
even a lot of state grants um if you're
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
accepting Federal money you have to
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
agree to abide by all federal you know
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination measures um it would
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know it would be a powerful
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
statement from the state of New
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I if if there were uh
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced or increased
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination Provisions put
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
within House Bill 20 if we're going to
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
be you know providing these vouchers to
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
people to use it any way they want thank
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
you very much much thank you uh repres
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you spoke to how
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
the schools are providing certain
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
services for free um that's in regards
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
to the equal access and transportation
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
but with that I'm a little bit confused
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
because I thought that that came within
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grants that come from the
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
state directly to the schools for those
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
students and I I don't quite understand
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
the objection to having those same
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant funds that are going into
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
the EFA program paying for those exact
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
same services that are paid for in the
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
public schools with those same funds
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
could you help me to understand that
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
better please sure thank you for the
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
question representative I'd be I'd be
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
happy to um I think the most basic
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
answer is that adequate adequacy grants
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be paid for inadequate
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
education inadequate education can only
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
be met by following um pertinent State
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
statutes relative to adequacy um by
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
following the minimum standards from
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education that
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
directly relate to State adequacy um and
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
all the other accountability aspects
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
that we talked about as well too uh to
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
your second question about the service
 
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.789 align:start position:0%
your second question about the service
providers

00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
um you know this again it sort of gets
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
back to the economy of scale a school
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
district May employ a speech
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
pathologist that Services 20 50 100 kids
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the school district um and
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
collectively that person is employed and
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
paid through some combination of both
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
state taxes your adequacy Grant and
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
local property taxes um here we're
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
simply giving money to parents to
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
provide the service that if the child
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
were enrolled in the public school the
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
child would be receiving for free anyway
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
you may have a special education bus
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
that drives three or four kids half a
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
dozen kids to and from school every day
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
whether the kids are are medically
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
fragile in a wheelchair whatever it may
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
be um so again by transporting six kids
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
at once
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
um you're saving the cost payers
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money as opposed to giving
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
people just a free check to transport
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
one child on a bus to a to a to a
 
00:54:04.599 --> 00:54:06.270 align:start position:0%
one child on a bus to a to a to a
potential

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
provider but I think the gist of the
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
question is that adequacy payments adade
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant should should be used to
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
pay for an adequate education an
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
adequate education can only be met by
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
meeting certain state
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
requirements which the bill lacks it
 
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
requirements which the bill lacks it
doesn't

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
require um and if I may have a followup
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
yes follow uh my my question to this is
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
is the way that I read it it appears
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
that the students would be able to use
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
these grants to purchase those same
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
services that benefit from the economies
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
of scale that you just spoke to is that
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
something that the Schoolboard
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
Association is opposed to allowing them
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
to bring those dollars back into the
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
public school system for things that
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they believe are served even though
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
the students are served served in other
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
educational modes outside the system
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know are so so our school
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
districts are now going to be vendors is
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
that I I mean is that what the if that
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
if that's the language of the bill I
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
understand you can bring it back in to
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
pro to get that speech therapy and those
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
OT therapy I don't think Public Schools
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
do that um I mean maybe a special ed
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
director could answer that question
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
better than I but it's not like it's not
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
like we're a private entity and we
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
advertise speech therapy services um and
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
bring kids in to receive them that
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
aren't residents of the district or
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
through some um you know uh
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
superintendents to share Services among
 
00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:34.870 align:start position:0%
superintendents to share Services among
school

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
districts thank you and I apologize for
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
getting too wonky on thank very quite
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
all right representative thank you for
 
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.549 align:start position:0%
all right representative thank you for
the

00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair uh and
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Christina for for um taking
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
my question um as you mentioned the the
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has a lot of roles in
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um accountability roles um you
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
know auditing roles and that sort of
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
thing and I think most people assume
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be the child
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund but there's
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
also the giving and goinging Alliance
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is uh for Christian Schools that's
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
that has been approved but um kind of
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
flies I think a little bit under what
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
people know about the scholarship funds
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
can you see an issue if um let's say 10
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
different scholarship funds come into
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
this program and decide that they're
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to take the you know six to 10% um
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
is there do you see any oversight for
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
the scholarship
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
organizations in this in this bill
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
itself um thank you for the question
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative um I did see there was
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
some reporting out to the department
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization and Ju
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
Just to your first point the the giving
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
and going or whatever you I I'm not
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with that organization I hadn't
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
heard of them before um I mean I know
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
that there there is some Provisions I
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm on page seven where it talks
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
about like a legislative
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
oversight commission um with some
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
parents and whatnot um you know I I the
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
bulk of NHS Ba's testimony and objection
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 20 is not so much about
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
the organization itself but rather um
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know the manner in which we're just
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
getting giv money away for people to use
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
sort of in a manner in whichever they
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
manner in whatever they see
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
fit so I'm I I don't I guess the simple
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
ansers I'm sorry representative I guess
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer for your
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you very
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
much your hand up oh yes
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question you
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
were talking about discrimination and
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
saying that the schools who take the
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
money should follow the same
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws but I'm
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think then that means
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
that an all girl school if they take any
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
girls from this they then have to take
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
boys as well thank you thank you for the
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
question representative um nobody
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
disputes that private entities are
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to create their own rules for
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
admission I'm not de I'm not debating
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm not arguing about that I'm not
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
making a policy decision on whether or
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
not an all girl school should accept
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
boys or whe whether or not a Christian
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
School should accept non-christians
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
that's not the point of nhp's testimony
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
the point is that we're giving State
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
money to to organizations that are
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this and we're authorizing
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
that in statute um that's not
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best policy or the best
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
practice Governor sonunu the last two
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
last I guess four or five years now
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
since he's been since he was elected in
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
2016 has made very concerted efforts to
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of all students in our
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
public schools um expanded um workplace
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
protections to transgender people
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
expanded um uh uh school-based
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
protections for transgender students um
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
created a private right of action for
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
people to sue against discrim for people
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
to sue Public Schools against
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination in whatever forms that
 
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
may come so it seems peculiar to me that
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
while nhsb sorry while the state has
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
made significant efforts to combat and
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
address discrimination within our Public
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
Schools we want to turn around and say
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
that but other schools receiving State
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy money don't have to abide by
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
those it it it it's a little
 
00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.510 align:start position:0%
those it it it it's a little
confounding

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
confounding
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
repres thank you very thank you very
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you very much Mr

Christina for joining us this morning
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
and and taking my question um you had um
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
you had referenced um the Manchester
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
School District in particular saying
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
that uh they have the lowest cost per
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
pupil in the state and uh and I was
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
wondering does that lowest cost reflect
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the fair cost to educate 13,000
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
students um that come from the with with
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
really the highest um incidence of uh of
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
family poverty and English language
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
Learners uh being able to educate them
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
to an equitable student outcome thank
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%

U Mr okono chair of the Manchester Board
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
of school committees testified I believe
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
it was on the building Aid Bill uh one
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
of the building Aid bills and he said
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
that you one of their high schools is is
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
120 years old or something a lot about
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
that you know that's Statewide um we
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
know you know representative Vlad has
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
been pushing for building Aid because
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%

you be interested to learn more about
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 158 that would direct an
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
additional $80 million in state funding
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%

not take any more questions I don't
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
believe we are have that many more
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh I think
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've done a good job in questioning the
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
two speakers which we just had the
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
presenters one from one side of the
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
point the from the other side going very
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
thorough and hopefully this will assist
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
people that are coming up to testify in
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
the future that they can Echo maybe the
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts of one or the other and and say
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
that so that we don't have to do a lot
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
of repeating today uh so with that I
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
would like to go on and I'm going to set
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
now we haven't had a Time Lim for these
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
first two speakers was pretty much even
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
as far as time between the two of them
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
so we're going to now go to the time
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
limit and it's going to be two minutes
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh per testifier from this point forward
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're still with well over 140 people
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
wanting to testify today that's divide
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
that by 2 minutes per person add a
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%

01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
have to sit in his seat for six hours
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
each day wasn't working for him he
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
didn't like learning at that point and
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
resisted um any kind of teaching uh in
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
school and at home and he viewed all of
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
it as just awful work that he didn't
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
want to do um at that time I decided to
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
take my son out of public school and we
 
01:05:00.039 --> 01:05:01.549 align:start position:0%
take my son out of public school and we
began

01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
began
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling uh for six months we did
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
what's known as deschooling which is
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
where you don't do any formal schooling
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
but instead fill your days with Museum
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
visits Library trips exploring nature
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
reading together and just talking about
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
what interests the child the idea is
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're following the child's lead and
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
exploring his interests discussing his
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
ideas and thoughts and answering
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions in a laid laid-back way to let
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
him learn to enjoy learning
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
again um by the end of that six months
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
my son who had been um unable to read
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
became a fluent reader um very quickly
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
with the freedom to direct his education
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
toward his interests in a flexible
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
manner that worked for him is what uh
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
made that possible the local public
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
schools may not offer what individual
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
students need they set standards which
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
the teachers have to teach to and
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
students who fall within a window of
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
those standards not too advanced and not
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
too far behind do very well well for
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
other students who may have different
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
learning styles it may not work out so
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
well and they need something different
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
we pay thousands of dollars in property
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
taxes every year around 80% of which
 
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
goes to our local school dist School
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
District in my town for the purpose of
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
educating children so many families
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
could benefit from using alternative
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
education method methods whether it be a
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
different public school private school
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
homeschool or Charter School I believe
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
if people truly care about children then
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
they would support this
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
legislation if these people who um claim
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
they care about children being
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
discriminated against don't support this
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
legislation you have gone beyond two
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
minutes so we're going have that
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
conclude with a single sentence and we
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
will move to the next speaker okay the
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
next speaker I'm are we not are we not
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
taking questions y well I want her to
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
conclude and then the next next person
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
might want to ask a question go ahead
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
what I want I I'm giving represent an
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give her summary
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
statement thank
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
you uh my summary is just that children
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
learn in different ways and this
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for us to give
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
an adequate education to kids in a way
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
that they need it and there's no
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination because you're sending
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
your you have a choice of where to send
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
your kids so we this discrimination
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue either thank thank you

well-being of our children and our state

education funding are a big piece of
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
that however I'd like to put that aside
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%

very active and brigh eyed um there's
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%

that Sparks life in a person and each
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
child is unique and it's one of the joys
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
of life to watch them grow up and
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
develop their own personalities um
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about children and
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
how to serve each student with the best
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
education for their unique abilities and
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
personalities and education savings
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
accounts are a proven way of doing
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
this currently adequate education grants
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
for each student are given directly to
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
the school district or Charter School
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
child attends that can leave children in
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
educational settings that aren't a good
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
fit for them we are currently funding
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
schools but not necessarily the best
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
education for each child in those
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
schools with an Esa program the state
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
would deposit that child's education
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
grant into a government approved savings
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
account so that amilies can pay for
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
state approved educational expenses
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
finally letting families match their
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
child to the education that best suits
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
him or her they're not a new public
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
policy idea nor are they destroying
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
Public Schools five states currently
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
have Esa programs Arizona Florida
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
Mississippi Tennessee and North Carolina
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
and as mentioned last week Arizona's
 
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
program started in 2011 and right now
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
about 4% of eligible students are
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
participating in the program school
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
choice programs including esas have
 
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
shown by numerous academic studies to
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
improve student outcome
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
in 17 studies of academic achievement 11
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
found gains in achievement four found no
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
effect and only three found a decline in
 
01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
effect and only three found a decline in
test

01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
scores we're at the uh end of your two
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
minutes uh can you please wrap that up
 
01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
minutes uh can you please wrap that up
and

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
questions certainly um so by letting
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
families match their children with the
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
education that best suits them esas
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
improve academic performance for both
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
participating and non-participating
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
students and make families more
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the education their
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
children are getting thanks very much uh
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
saying it really does process side thank
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
you go ahead May uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me um I wanted to
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
address a couple of points points the
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
first being the idea that when a child
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
leaves the public schools to go to a
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
private school of some kind that that
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
saves the school district money that is
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
not usually the case in fact uh usually
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
nothing is saved and and I can explain
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to use Nash as an example
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
not because it's different or more
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
important or anything but just because I
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
know the numbers but this is true in
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
every Community large and small so we
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
have 4 some
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
classrooms across 17 schools and 12
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
grades plus kindergarten plus a little
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
prek so let's say 300 kids
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
leave now so there's one kid in Amis
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
Street school at in the third grade you
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
know two kids uh in a couple of
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
different grades in another school the
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
class size gets reduced from 21 to 20 or
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
something like that it doesn't save any
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
money at
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
all Because unless the people leaving
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
were concentrated all in one classroom
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
or all in one
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
grade which never is going to happen you
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
still have the same teaching
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you same have still have
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
the same schools all of the same
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
expenses so maybe over very very long
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
term you know if a if many kids left
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
over many years I mean yeah eventually
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
there might be some savings but
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
certainly in the short term there
 
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
certainly in the short term there
absolutely

01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
nothing uh number two I would just like
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
to address the uh cost of an adequate
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
education now there's a constitutional
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
mandate that the state provide funding
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education the fiscal
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
note on the bill says that the cost is
 
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
average State average is 19,000 or
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
something approaching that and the
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant is 3600 so the state is
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
not even coming close to to meeting its
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund an adequate education
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
and if there are educational funds
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
available uh the you know and those
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
should go in my opinion to the public
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
schools until we really do fund an
 
01:16:09.159 --> 01:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
schools until we really do fund an
adequate

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
education the third the cost of the kids
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
that are already out of of not even in
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
public schools where there would be
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
clearly no savings the commissioner
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
testified the other day that all those
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
children would be eligible for the uh
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant kids that are already
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
in private schools well if you look at
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note you see that there are
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
22,000 kids between private schools and
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
homeschooling who would receive or be
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive these funds these
 
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.629 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive these funds these
State

01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%

01:16:46.639 --> 01:16:49.629 align:start position:0%
State

01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%

out of the state you know uh just for
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
kids that are already in private school
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
in any event thank you Mr chair for the
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify Mr are you
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%

thank you very much repres thank you Mr
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Mayor uh May n you
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
You' really testified to this committee
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
about your concerns about Nash losing
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
students and revenue to Innovation
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
schools do you still have that
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
concern I've never said that I don't
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
know when what you're talking about but
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I have not testified that I'm worried
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
about losing kids to Innovation schools
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm worried about is that the state
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
providing nearly enough assistance to
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education and when
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
someone does leave to go to another
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
school it does not result in savings to
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
district thank thank you very much Mr
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
then thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
and thanks thanks very much Mr Mayor for
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning and and being
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
willing to uh to to take uh take
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions um I was wondering if um if uh
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
you would be interested in in learning
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
more about um uh Senate Bill 158 which
 
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
would actually reduce uh property taxes
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
in um in the city of nashaa by 78 cents
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
but it would also direct uh nearly $224
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
million of additional State educational
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
grants to them um uh to the nashwa
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
school district and that amounts
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
calculated specifically to improve uh
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the student outcomes that you were
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
talking about order Mr chair is this
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for him to keep asking about
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
a separate bill asking the same question
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
everybody regarding no no there I'm not
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
question so and and it's directed to the
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
mayor's um comments about student
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
ahead no no I've I've asked the question
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
or you have a question rep yeah I I
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question all right can you
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
hear me now I don't know um if I'm
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to answer the question I would
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
say yes I'd be more interested in
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
learning about it but I'm concerned
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
about educational quality in public
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
schools across the state of New
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cities like man NASA but also
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
small towns where you know kids there
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
deserve just the same help so uh I'm
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about Nashville but really all
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
kids in the state thank you Mr
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
Mayor further questions I thank you Mr
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Mayor since this
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
loss of State funds and property taxes
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
tax increases is such a concern what is
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
your plan to deal with the declining
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers that we've been
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
seeing over the past decades and our
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
forecasted to continue without property
 
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
forecasted to continue without property
tax

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
increases uh well if you look at uh the
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
percentages that departments in
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
Nashville have gone up the school
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
department has gone up significantly
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
less than the police department the fire
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
department Public Works and other
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
departments and I think that's
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
because uh the you know gradually the
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment which is not
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
terribly significant I but we still have
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
over 11,000 kids uh the uh the declining
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment probably over a period of
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
very long period of time has enabled the
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
district to keep costs down below what
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
other departments have going
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
up thank you are there any further
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
mayor not seeing any hands thank you
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%

you all today um first class wallet uh
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
is a financial technology uh this year
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
we are um under contract and currently
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the process of Contracting to work
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
with about $550 million of federal uh
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
Grant funds uh with state and local
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
agencies being delivered to both
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
families for programs like this in Esa
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
teachers and schools uh we did help
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
Arizona to resolve their challenges with
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh fraud and do completely eliminate the
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
possibility of fraud as a financial
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
technology what we do is provide a
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
closed loop system where families uh
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
could only access first of all vendors
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
that have been preapproved and vetted by
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
the granting organization and not be
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
able to pay anyone outside of that
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
boundary um additionally um as an
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
education wallet um parents access that
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
pool of approved only vendors they uh
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
they then can submit a digital um
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
request very very easy for parents to
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
use by the way um and and that digital
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
request actually for the specific either
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh Service uh like a tutor for example
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
or educational item that they need get
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
submitted but it actually doesn't go
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere they're simply making a a
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
request uh once the request is made that
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
goes over to the granting administrator
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
that Grant administrator has full
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vet and make sure that
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is fully compliant with the B
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
within the boundaries of where the money
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
can be spent so it completely eliminates
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
the pro possibility of fraud as no
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
purchase can happen unless it's approved
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
once that is approved we facilitate the
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
payment and the money flow of that
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
transaction in other words we will pay
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
the vendor we will they will be able to
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
get the goods through one of our vendors
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace that they have been
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to access we deal with shipping

please what is uh your administrative
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
fee for conducting this service
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely our administrative fee is
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
0.5% um and then as far as the rest goes
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
the vendors in the marketplace pay us a
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you know a commissionable amount uh
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
we also have a transaction fee that is
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
um you know not doesn't need to be paid
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
by the state uh just very similar if you
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
could imagine PayPal and how when
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
someone swipes a card there's a
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
transaction fee um when someone pays
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
with PayPal we have that as well and
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
that payment can be directed to wherever
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
you would like that most times and in
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
the case of Arizona for example that
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
payment is directed to the vendors just
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
like when somebody pays their babysitter
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
with the PayPal there's a fee that comes
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
out and that's
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
2.5% thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%

question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I had a
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
question about for example if I wanted
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
to purchase a a novel um from Kindle
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
books on
 
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
Amazon and um would
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
Amazon then be one of the um granting
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
vendors or would I have to go to a
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
vendor for the same book that may be of
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
a high higher price that that has been
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
approved good question so um we will
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
allow whatever vendors um your your team
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
the granting administrator wants to
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
allow so Amazon can be allowed in the
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
marketplace or not allowed in the
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
marketplace um and uh and there are uh
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
around 60 uh educational vendors and we
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
can also onboard local vendors such as a
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
local tutor if that is permissible um so
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
we don't really arbitrate you know
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not a vendor uh is allowed or
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
not that's for you to decide from The
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
Wheelhouse of what is acceptable um and
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
there should be plenty of opportunity to
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
shop that novel around um and if it's
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
not a permissible novel then that data
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
of the name and the title of the book
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
The Novel itself will go over to the
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
grant administrator and they'll be able
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
to look at that and say am I going to
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
allow this novel or
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
not um a followup then on that please Mr
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
chair yes go ahead so so um what are you
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
saying that the grant
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
administrator actually can choose to not
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to take a certain novel or a
 
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.149 align:start position:0%
allow them to take a certain novel or a
certain

01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
textbook yes that that's not something
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
that we arbitrate they have the the
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
grant administrator can look at the
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
compliancy guidelines and decide whether
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
that novel is compliant and either
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
approve or reject the
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
purchase thank you very much I don't see

Banfield youve you not on this subject
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
Anar you've been
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
promoted go ahead okay thank you very
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
much um my name is Anar Banfield and I'm
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
an advocate for parental rights and
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and education I do
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
come here in support of hb20 however I
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
do have some concerns with the language
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
and want to make sure that it would
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
protect the homeschool Community I think
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
others may be testifying on that so I'm
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
just going to kind of skip over that
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
part um we heard about accountability I
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
again want to stress that this bill
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
allows accountability to parents and
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
when I work with parents across the
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
state is because they feel that there's
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
no accountability in their Viewpoint
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
which is what brings them to me in the
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
first place so you know we can go back
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
and forth with accountability but you
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of parents out there
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
that uh don't feel like their school
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
what that they're in uh is accountable
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
to them um most of what I approached you
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
with on uh HB 607 I I would duplicate on
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
this bill in terms of using a balanced
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
approach supporting public excellence in
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
public education and choice for the few
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
who need it uh in my research parents
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
prefer their local public school there's
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it when you provide uh an
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
excellent uh education choice in the
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
public schools that's where parents want
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
their kids most parents superintendant
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
have school choice they can choose
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
private or religious schools and divert
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
public funds towards those schools they
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
send some of their children to religious
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
or private schools that have their own
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
policies in terms of who they will
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
accept no one has brought forth any
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
issues of discrimination when they
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
choose a school to send some of their
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
public school students too so in terms
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the schools that accept these
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
students or in the fact that public
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
schools will not do all that they can do
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
to provide the best education for their
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
CH for that child so using the kind of
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
logic that we've heard today in terms of
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination it it almost seems like
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
you can make a case then that the public
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
school is discriminating against the
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
child that they're sending to a private
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
school because they can't provide the
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
needs for that specific child I think we
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
need to just go back to
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
letting Miss bfield we are now beyond
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
the two minutes so can you please
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mar I don't and Marie I don't think
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sure you know just to to to
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
bring up one last point is that schools
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
also divert public funds to lobbying
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
organizations like the nhba the nhsaa Lo
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers pay their salaries and
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
then we hear them talk about how this
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
would divert funds to private schools
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
but this is happening
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
in public schools as we speak so I just
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
think that those are the kinds of those
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of things we need to think
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
about you know we're arguing back and
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
forth where this money is being diverted
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
to but we need to make sure that we're
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're diverting it for the best
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
interest of the child and I think that's
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
what hb20 does so thank you for taking
 
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
what hb20 does so thank you for taking
my

01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Mr chair Mr chair can I ask
 
01:32:53.709 --> 01:32:53.719 align:start position:0%
that people people be given some sort of
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
warning when they're close to the two
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
minutes I find it
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
very almost rude that uh people are
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
getting um muted uh right mids sentence
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
I mean at least give them some sort of
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
warning that they're uh maybe within 30
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
seconds of their two minutes so they can
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
wrap it up and and um I think that that
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
would work much better respon to your
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
request represent we do have
 
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.390 align:start position:0%
request represent we do have
15

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
seconds however people are M I don't
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
want to off that point time and they
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
keep for for for us to interject right
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
here using a technology we have
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
still was we had mute them then we try
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
to explain but it's given
 
01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's due to the nature of this

correct something earlier today at this
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
hearing it was said that I was the vice
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%

Member from Manchester I'm a Committee

Member at large representing all 12
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
Wards but I am not the current Vice

chair I am the chair of the education
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation Committee of the manest
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
school board um but I'm here today
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
speaking on on my own behalf as a school
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
board member in Manchester so um just
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh first of all I'd
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
identify with the remarks of bar
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
Christina earlier and I'd refer the
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee to a submission saying by
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
Bishop Robert hershfield the Episcopal
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
Bish Bishop of of New Hampshire
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday I think it's an important
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint that represents it represents
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
of churchgoing people in in the state of
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that correctly identifies
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
the division between church and state
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
and the inequity of um of uh uh involved
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
in in using public funds uh for those
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
purposes I one one other thing I would
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
say is that with regard to Manchester
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
and the and the efficiencies of of of
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
larger populations um the Reas the
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
numbers for per student spending in the
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire have just been
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
released for last year in Manchester is
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually it's third from the bottom
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
there are two smaller towns that spend
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
slightly less but they only have
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
elementary schools but we're spending
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
122,000 dollar 1225 thousand per student
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
the state average is close to 20 um if
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
people want to rest easy in bed at night
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
time by telling themselves that that's
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
because of efficiencies of numbers then
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
so be it but that's being delusional the
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
fact is we have uh huge deficiencies
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh that that we're coping with
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a h large budget
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
reduction in Manchester reducing
 
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
services and doing everything we can to
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
provide an an education to the many
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
children in our great City and um it
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to me to be honest when I
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
in we Jim we you know at the end of that
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
few minutes could you please summarize
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
where you are and then we'll open up to
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you chairman yes I I I
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'll just summarize by what I I refer to
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the to the to the the people I refer
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
to um I I I just I just think that there
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
is such a lack of of funding already in
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
in in public education in the state to
 
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh to divert money from that desperate
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
need is H is just doesn't make good
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
economic sense for the State of New
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh Mr luno I'm sorry rep luno
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
has his hand
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
rais thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um um Mr oconnell
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
for uh for joining us um this morning
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
and and talking about Manchester
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
do you believe that um and this is
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
specific to your testimony do you
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
believe that um that the Manchester
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
school district is um is funded I guess
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately that would provide the
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education or
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
at least a Statewide um um adequate
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
outcome for students yeah I I think that
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
think thank you for the question
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative luno I I think that you
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
know we we we can be dispassionate and
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
objective and just look at data and
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
numbers and and you know there are
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
judgments we can make on some things but
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
just in terms of data I talked to here
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
last week we talk about the this
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
building funding issue about the average
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
school in Manchester being 70 years old
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're closing a school we just
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
announced it last week um so we go from
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
22 schools to 21 um but in in data terms
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
we have uh the largest or some of the
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
large some we've improved a little in
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
the last a couple of years but we've got
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
some of the largest class sizes in the
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
state in terms of per pupil rate r
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
we uh we pay uh when I look at I looked
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
at the number $80 million uh that might
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
go through that might go from this
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding just if people in P private
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
schools presy were to go if you consider
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
we pay a starting teacher 39,000 that's
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
rough that's as near to 40 as you can
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
get divide 40,000 into 80 million that's
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
we could hire 2,000 starting teachers
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money that this bill
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
might send elsewhere so I won't go on
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
but the data is very clear um we do not
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
we are not in a position to give the
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
children of Manchester the education
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
deserve follow up on that Mr
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
chair yeah thank thank you so uh would
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
the with the 80 million that would be um
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
directed to Manchester through Center
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 158 um uh move Manchester closer to
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
um to uh uh you know Statewide um um uh
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
performance outcomes uh without writing
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
the paper on that I would of course I
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
would just point this out that under the
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers from last year I I haven't
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
done the calculation for this year but
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
numbers from last year Manchester spends
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
$53 million less than what it would
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
spend if it spent the state average per
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
student so if we just spend and clearly
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have not just the average level of
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
need in the city of Manchester we've
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
greater than the average uh level of
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
need but if we were to just spend the
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
state average that what every other town
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the state spends on their students
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
per student if we just did that we would
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
need an additional $53 million and just
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
to make the point clearly the tax the
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers of Manchester we
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
could never Levy $53 million and expect
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the working people of Manchester and
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the home owners to pay that great thank
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%

01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
itus uh we have uh Mr Jonathan
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
Weinberg hi um thank you I'll try to
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
make this pretty brief my name is
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Weber and I'm a recently
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
elected member of the conquered school
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
board and a product of the New Hampshire
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
Public School System last week the
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
conquered School Board issued a Stern
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
statement opposing this legislation
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
statement is as follows our district is
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated to cultivating and providing a
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
strong and inclusive public education
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
for students in our schools House Bill
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
20 also known as the Richard Dick hinch
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
education freedom savings account
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
program compromises not only this ideal
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
but our public education system as a
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
whole therefore we the conquered School
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
Board unequivocally stand a post hp20
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
and any iteration that seeks to
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
dismantle our public education system I
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
would just like to note that entities
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
like police agencies and firefighters
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
are not becoming privatized as we
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
instead allocate additional public funds
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
to support these agencies so why are we
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
attempting to privatize our public
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
education system this does not make
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
education more accessible or even lower
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
educational costs but merely places more
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
burden on local school districts to
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
supplement the loss income from State
 
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding I thank you for your
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
time and I'm open to questions but I
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
know there is a long
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
list thank you questions from committee
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
members repr luno yeah thank you very
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and thank you very
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
much um Mr Weinberg for joining us this
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
morning and for your work with the uh
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
with the conquered School Board would
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
would you say that um property taxpayers
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
in conquered are working pretty hard
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
to um U to provide the um the the the
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
level of funding that you do in
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
conquered for um to educate conquered
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
students I think definitely especially
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
as we're in budget season right now uh
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
the onus is definitely on the property
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to ensure that we provide an
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education so follow up on that
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
would you be interested in learning more
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill 158 that would would
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
reduce that could reduce the property
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate and conquered by over $2 per
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
thousand and still provide the same I'm
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
soror representative but we're talking
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
about20 not Senate bills
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
today okay
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions next speaker is next speaker
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
is um Chris Ager Chris you've been
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
promoted uh go ahead and
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
speak good morning my name is uh Chris
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
Ager I'm representing myself I live in
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
Amherst uh New Hampshire I'm a former
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
School Board member of a neighboring
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
town I support
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
hb20 I support it on conceptual grounds
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
that first our first mission should be
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
what's best for the children what's the
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
best way we can educate them I believe
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
the one thing we're missing in education
 
01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
now is vigorous competition comp
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
competition Spurs Innovation it can help
 
01:44:25.629 --> 01:44:25.639 align:start position:0%
lower cost and it can increase the
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
responsiveness of the organization to
 
01:44:28.159 --> 01:44:28.910 align:start position:0%
responsiveness of the organization to
the

01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
consumer um so I'm I know that perfect
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
is the enemy of good enough but hb20 is
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
a great step towards competition and
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
doing what's best for the students and
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
the children I urge you to support hb20
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr AER U questions from
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
rep Tanner uh represent
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh thank you uh Mr chair and
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
Agger

01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
Agger
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
um I was a longtime coach uh at the high
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
school that I taught at and one thing
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
about competition is that you kind of
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
need a fair playing playing field do you
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
consider um public schools that have to
 
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
accept every student um regardless of
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
their ability or their income or um any
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of attribute that that puts
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
them on a fair playing field with a
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
private school that can pick and choose
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
who they um take as their
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
students sure thank you for the question
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
so bringing everybody down to the worst
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
possible lowest comedy denominator I
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
think is the absolute worst possible
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
public policy you can you can have we
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
should have the a a chain as strong as
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
the strongest link let every child
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
achieve their potential don't bring them
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
down because someone else cannot achieve
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
so we should absolutely do the best for
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
individual children one at a time cookie
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
cutter does not work in business I don't
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
think it works well in
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
education just think if we forced
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
everyone to go to McDonald's we'd get
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
greasy burgers limpy fries and watery
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
milkshakes but we have competition it
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
drives them to provide better for all of
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
their consumers and it actually drives a
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
price down we wouldn't have Chick-fil-A
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
or Wendy's if we treated fast food the
 
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
education thank you Mr chairman Mr a
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you just for taking my question I
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
um I find it uh distressing that you're
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh comparing widgets and business and
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
and uh projects and production to
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
students um I'm just trying to figure
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
parallel so it's in in running an
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
organization and getting
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency why would you not learn from
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
best practices in business keeping in
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
mind that the number one mission is
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
those individual
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
students it's and if you can do it
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
better within the same budget or even
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
pay more to get a better quality product
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you try to do that why
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you allow people to go to find
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
what's best for them it's like water
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
flowing down a hill it'll find the right
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
path to meet what they need and so to
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
force everyone especially people who
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the money and the financial
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
resources to force them to go to a
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
school that may not work for them I
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't think is looking out for the best
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
interest of the students follow up Mr
 
01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
chairman if I
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
may yes thank you just one final on your
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
your analogy Mr M Mike if you do you
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe if you take 800 millionar are
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
the public school system that's going to
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
better yes I absolutely do necessity is
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
the mother of invention we took
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
consumers out of
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald's by allowing Wendy's and
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
Chick-fil-A McDonald's didn't go away
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
they didn't go out of business they
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
didn't get worse they got better they
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
Rose to the challenge of the competition
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
the individual The Innovation from
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
Individual teachers superintendent
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
school districts will drive a better
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
environment for everyone competition
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
breeds Innovation and Innovation is
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
Paramount to public education thank you
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman represent luno thank you
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and thank you very
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
much Mr Ager for being with us this
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
morning and for taking um my question
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
but um uh we've had testimony here by
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
from the commission
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
um that uh about New Hampshire's public
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
school student outcomes being you know
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
top five you know in the country so I
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
was just sort of wondering what you are
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
talking about when you when you refer to
 
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
the lowest common
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
denominator so I was responding thank
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
you for the question I was responding to
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the uh to the the the previous um
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislator's question uh with respect to
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
to widgets versus versus students um but
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
number five is good but every single
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
individual child is not in the top five%
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
or the top five and so why not allow
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
them to do the best that they can do as
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
an individual student and why not allow
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
that it just seems to me we would
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely want every individual student
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
to find the best path for them and if we
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
can help by allowing them and helping
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
them to go somewhere else at a much
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
lower average cost than what we we need
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
to spend for our public students why
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we do that and have everyone do
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
better we can always do better everyone
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
better follow up on that Mr chair so
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
when you refer to the a much lower
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
average cost what are you what are you
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
referring to there I'm talking about the
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
C the average cost per student versus
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
what the allocation would be for student
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
20 okay thank you I mean thank
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Ager thank you next
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
speaker is uh Bonnie Bonnie Dunham and
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
she's been promoted so go ahead and
 
01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:43.709 align:start position:0%
she's been promoted so go ahead and
unmute

01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
yourself there Hi I believe I'm unmuted
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
now Bonnie Dunham from Marram New
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I agree with the points
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
that have been raised by others who
 
01:50:52.639 --> 01:50:53.870 align:start position:0%
that have been raised by others who
oppose

01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
hb20 I really fear that communities
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
school districts and children remaining
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
in public schools will pay dearly for
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
hb20 and I have three main reasons for
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill one is fiscal and in
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
addition to everything you've heard hb20
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
does not require a parent to withdraw a
 
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
child from public school and so a child
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
who only becomes ineligible for an EFA
 
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
if they attend a public school for more
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
than half the time could conceivably
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
attend a public school for 49% of the
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
day receiving any accommodations they
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
need such as an interpreter maybe even
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
special education at the expense of the
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
public school that has receiving no
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
funds parent could also use an EFA to
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
pay for an intensive short-term therapy
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
or en or enrichment program and then
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
reenroll their child in the public
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
school for the rest of the year again no
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
state aid available and even if a child
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
reenroll full-time the EFA St funds
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
still stay available for the parent to
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
use while the public school is educating
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
their child New Hampshire is
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
experiencing unprecedented challenges is
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
this really the best time to establish a
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
costly program that some people want but
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't need um it lacks accountability
 
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any performance
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
accountability measures only an annual
 
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
satisfaction survey doesn't require
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
qualifications for providers as you've
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
heard not even a criminal background
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
check while I know it's not the intent
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
with unqualified providers able to teach
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
children with no follow-up
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
accountability I fear that for some
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
children hb20 may become the freedom
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
from Education Act it supports
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination it's very clear they
 
01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate against providers
 
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's a different story about children
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
children can be discriminated against
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
including on the basis of disability and
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
since the Ada the Americans with
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act is exempt from the from
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
um the Ada any any private religious
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
school could openly and explicitly
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate against a child based on
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
that child's disability I've included
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
the citation in my written testimony it
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
claims to expand opportunities for
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
children but by allowing this type of
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination it actually reduces
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the most vulnerable
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
groups of children I really do not want
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes to support private schools
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
that can discriminate against my child
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
so please don't pass this bill an
 
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.270 align:start position:0%
so please don't pass this bill an
earlier

01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we open up questions
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
take

01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
M Mr chair can I ask a question um if
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
the if these people are calling in uh do
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
they see Representatives Leon's little
 
01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:32.910 align:start position:0%
they see Representatives Leon's little
uh

01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
marker that that's why I'm also having
 
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
to you know cut in and and let them know
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
that they've gone beyond I'm trying to
 
01:53:43.470 --> 01:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
be courteous and allow them to go beyond
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit and and
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
summarize but yes and and I realize that
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
and and that's what I'm asking but it
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
seems like they're being muted mids
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
sentence which to me is rude I think
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
that if you cut in at the end of a
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
sentence when it's appropriate it would
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
be much better I I just I I'm having
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
problems with this um
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
process I had one sentence
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
left best we can repres hson has to you
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
know do the technology stuff over there
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
after I give her the signal that we've
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
gone beyond and so we're trying to time
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
it properly but yes it does sometimes
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
come in the middle of the sentence and
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know how to fix that um
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of having remote
 
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.589 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of having remote
testimony

01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
disrespectful so is
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
is still there yep she is she's
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
unmuted I had one sentence left I was
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
halfway through my last sentence if I
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
could finish so saying that there's no
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination because people can choose
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
where to send their schools it's like
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
saying whites only lunch counters were
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
not discriminatory because people could
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
choose to eat someplace
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much Bonnie and
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
welcome it's good to hear your voice
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
again here at the education committee
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes I was
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you knew that
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
in here one of the um possible ex um
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
expenses is for Public School courses so
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if a kid did go 49% of the time to
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
the high school the high school would
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
have to be paid out of that educational
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
Freedom account I did read that it
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear though and since um RSA 193
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
allows children who are homeschooled or
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
attending private schools to participate
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
in extracurricular and co-curricular
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
activities at their Public School it it
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they have to pay for it
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
followups yes you may um the educ the uh
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
doe does pay the state does pay for
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
those um when a homeschooler goes to a
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
high school a that's pro-rated and that
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
is paid for by the state
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
if a child needs an interpreter the
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
state does not pay for
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
that while they're attending that
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%

questions Mullen has her hand
 
01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:40.030 align:start position:0%
questions Mullen has her hand
up

01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:56:43.069 --> 01:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
mull you there thank you uh thank you Mr
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh Miss Dunham for
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
taking the question um Miss Dunham am I
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
correct that you um in your professional
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
capacity serve as an advocate for
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
parents who have special needs children
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'm here as a private citizen but I
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
work at the parent information center
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
where I provide Education and Training
 
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
for parents so that they can participate
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
meaningfully and making decisions for
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
their child in the special ed
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
process okay so I a followup please uh
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um so I would I would not I I
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
know that you can't answer this question
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
with any kind of 100 % accuracy but is
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that if parents were
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
given funds and able to go out and
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
choose their own provider for
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
services uh that they would have
 
01:57:34.119 --> 01:57:35.589 align:start position:0%
services uh that they would have
difficulty

01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
navigating how and who to
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
choose yes I I believe that that would
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
be difficult and particularly to ensure
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
that all of their child's needs were met
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
um it's a really emotional decision that
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
people make and um and sometimes things
 
01:57:52.109 --> 01:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks and then the
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
public school will pick up the pieces
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
after the child
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
welcome see has his hand
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
up thank you re thank you for taking my
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
question Miss Dunham in this bill I
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
believe that if a parent should choose
 
01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
to uh participate in this voucher
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
program that has a uh special ed student
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
they give up any of their rights uh both
 
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide and federally for any
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
assistance uh once they accept this
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
voucher if that is
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
true uh what might be some of the
 
01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
problems that a parent would incur as a
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
result of making that
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
choice first it doesn't say that it says
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization would
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
inform that theyve that they have lost
 
01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
rights but it doesn't say that they do
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and so that's a that's not quite
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
clear and then if a if a parent places a
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
child privately um and it's a nonprofit
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
private school the school district where
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
that child is where that school is
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
located still has some responsibility to
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
to serve that child minimal
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility but some and so I think
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
parents would have a hard time um
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
grasping that concept completely about
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
what they really are giving up and then
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
finding a way to make up for that using
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
private funds those services are way
 
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
more expensive than I think some people
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand thank you you're
 
01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:26.470 align:start position:0%
understand thank you you're
welcome

01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
questions not see any hands thank you
 
01:59:29.159 --> 01:59:29.870 align:start position:0%
questions not see any hands thank you
very

01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome thank you thank you

go
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
ahead hello thank you so much my name is
 
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
Karen Leo Hill I'm a 16 Senor City
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
councelor in the city of Lebanon I am
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
here today in opposition to hb20 I was
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually homeschooled for high school
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
myself uh so I think I have a an
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
interesting perspective on this my two
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
daughters went to Lebanon Public Schools
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
um where they have had um good
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
experiences it seems to me that some of
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
the underlying motivation for this bill
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
is to improve public education in New
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that's actually
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
something that many of us agree on
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's common ground on a lot of this
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
but in fact if the motivation is to
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
improve public education then removing
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
funding from the public schools is not
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
the way to achieve this we should be
 
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
looking at how to actually address the
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
inadequacies in our public schools and
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
make those improvements I want to
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
underscore two particular points because
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat what others have
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
said last week I heard commissioner edel
 
02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
blute speak about the three-year um the
 
02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
I think he called it a a generous
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
three-year window before schools would
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
start losing funding based on declining
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment due to these efas well in
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
fact schools are built uh the
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
Investments for infrastructure um
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
usually require bonds that are over many
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
decades and those fixed costs are spread
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
out over um over many decades and
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
there's this concept of
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
intergenerational Equity where all of us
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
are contributing to the costs associated
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
with providing public education a
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
threeyear window um before schools start
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
losing funds is not going to address the
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
long-term Investments and debt that
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
schools have had to take on in order to
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
provide those facilities I know how
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
precious taxpayer dollars are as a local
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
official and I know how devastating it
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
will be as property taxes continue to
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
rise due to this uh due to
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
hb20 I also want to talk about the
 
02:02:00.069 --> 02:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
impact on vulnerable children we have
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
been facing uh most parents of course
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
are going to make good choices for their
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
children and would certainly use funds
 
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
to improve uh to improve the situation
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
children thank you I'll can I just
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
children thank you I'll can I just
wrap

02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
wrap
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
I'll just wrap by saying that as
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we also have to consider the
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and what will happen
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
when some parents don't make the best
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
choices and use the funds for other
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
purposes I encourage you all to um think
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
about the most vulnerable in our
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
communities as you are taking a position
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
please um thank you for taking my
 
02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.030 align:start position:0%
please um thank you for taking my
question

02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you could maybe
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
tell us how you feel the public school
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
system uh is a kind of a safety net for
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children in your
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
area thank you so much representative
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
Tanner I think that when children are in
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
schools and there's been concern about
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
this over this past year with remote
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
learning when children are in schools
 
02:03:20.189 --> 02:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
there is in in fact Ed a great safety
 
02:03:23.069 --> 02:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
net around them there are people who can
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
notice um what might be going on in
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
someone's life there might be people who
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
notice bruising uh that might not that
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be there there are people
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
who notice uh we know that um school
 
02:03:37.709 --> 02:03:37.719 align:start position:0%
that food scarcity is a real problem in
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there are people in
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
schools who this is schools are a source
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
of food for a lot of students in New
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are people the
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
teachers the Paras the school nurse uh
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
there's just a whole community of people
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
of other adults who are looking who are
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
looking out for people and you know I
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
think we know in New Hampshire from the
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
over the last several years the
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
testimony about child protective
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
services and
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
DCF that there are children who are
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and who are being exploited
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a serious concern
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
for this committee to think about um
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh next we'll welcome in Mary
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me yes thank you
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm Mary wilky from conquered
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I oppose this bill and I'll just
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
make two quick points that I haven't
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
heard made before um one is that the
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
Bill's supporters say there's nothing
 
02:04:56.549 --> 02:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional about sending public
 
02:04:59.069 --> 02:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
money to religious schools and uh even
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
if that's true that doesn't make it good
 
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
public policy um textbooks used in some
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
of our the religious schools in New
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um say for instance that
 
02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
Catholics are practicing distorted
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
Christianity I don't think taxpayers who
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
are uh Catholic should be required to
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
pay for books that denounce their
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
religion and nor do I want to pay for
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
books that teach children that men
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
should dominate women secondly
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
supporters justify esas by saying
 
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
they're for children who just aren't
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
getting what they need in public school
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
but if that's the case I wonder why the
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
program is open even to children who
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
have never stepped foot in a public
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
school uh last year I heard a parent
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
testify in in um support of the
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
education tax credit scholarship program
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
which uses the same justification she
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
said that as soon as she learned about
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
that program she signed up all eight of
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
her children and sent them to private
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
school and it's hard for me to believe
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
that not a single one of those eight
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
children could have gotten what they
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
need in public
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
school I believe that the best way to
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
help students who aren't getting what
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
they need in their local school would be
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
to focus on the thousands of students
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
who live in property poor towns who are
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
denied opportunities that their peers in
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
wealthier towns have a child whose
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
school doesn't offer chemistry foreign
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
language elos or the Arts is also not
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
getting what she needs these systemic in
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
Equity should be addressed before we
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
create a whole new parallel system of
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
publicly funded private schools the
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
state just spent a half a million
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
dollars on a study by the school funding
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
commission to address this problem and I
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
ask you to please turn your attention to
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
their report instead of pushing for
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
privatization programs like H hb20 thank
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
you very much okay thank you we have I
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
think we have a question couple
 
02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:45.750 align:start position:0%
think we have a question couple
questions

02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you Mr acting chair and
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss wilky for testifying uh
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a concern that some uh
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
non-public schools may have some
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
textbooks that would be uh may have
 
02:07:02.549 --> 02:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
material that some would not care for uh
 
02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that any
 
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
prolation uh or do you think any public
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
schools currently have any textbooks
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
that are of serious concern to some
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
parents uh thank you for your question
 
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who's asking the question I
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell by at my screen but it's
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett oh hi thank
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
you very much uh I'm sure there are
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
parents who um disagree with some of the
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
content for instance maybe some science
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
content that might just might be in
 
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with their religious beliefs
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
but at least a public school curriculum
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
has been approved by the state and it's
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's not a religious curriculum which is
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
different I think um I also think that
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh as a tax payer I if I felt that a
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
school was teaching something that was
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect and that was prosing some
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
religious belief I could go to my school
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
board I could Lobby them I could U run
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
for school board I have some options I
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't even know I I know I've read some
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the textbooks that some of our
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
private religious schools use but I have
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing what they're actually
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
teaching you know as a as a person that
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
you're asking to fund them so that's
 
02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's a concern I have thank you thank
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
you repr
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
luno question yeah thank you very much
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and thank you very much
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
Miss wilky for joining us this morning
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question but I was
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
wondering you you you you mentioned you
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
talked about student inequities and I I
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
was wondering if um if you if there's
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
maybe a COR if there's a correlation
 
02:08:42.549 --> 02:08:42.559 align:start position:0%
between um um poverty or incidents of
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
poverty and um and student
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes um my I'm I'm a retired teacher
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
te by the way I don't think I said that
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes from what I've read and and I
 
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
think reaching H New Hampshire just did
 
02:08:56.669 --> 02:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
a big study about that that student
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
poverty is very highly correlated with
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
um with poor
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
outcomes thank you very much Miss Wilkey
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you question um representative MAF
 
02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
asked basically the same question I
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
ask okay thank you miss Wii uh next have
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
um Hall Charlie you've been promoted so
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead and speak
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
please yes uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh education committee members my name
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
is Charles Hall I'm a resident of
 
02:09:30.030 --> 02:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
national New Hampshire have been for
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
over 60 years uh two children through
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
national school system and a grandson
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
and uh grandchildren and
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
great-grandchildren currently in public
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
school system uh across the
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
state I strongly support House Bill 20
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
because it provides the bridge between
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
what we have to what we need new
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's demographics and student
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
diversity require an educational system
 
02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
that will meet the needs of all students
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live or
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
household income this bill will help
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
break the cycle of poverty to prison
 
02:10:02.109 --> 02:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
because well-educated students are more
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
likely to be an asset to society rather
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
than a burden students thrive in a
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%

I have taught for over 40 years
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh so I I have a a a lot of
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
experience um and uh wide experience I'd
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
like to urge you to oppose
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
hb20 for several reasons it uses
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money to pay for part of the
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
cost to send children to private schools
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
states with comparable voucher systems
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
and it is a voucher system whether
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it reveals the
 
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
fact that the rich game the system and
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
the poor get gamed private teachers need
 
02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
no certification whatsoever there's no
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to test your child's
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
progress and they can use your our tax
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
our tax funds as so-called fees for
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
anything they want and a school gets
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
full funds if they teach only 51% of the
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
time what is educational or fair about
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
hb20 outcomes HB 20 redirects our taxes
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
to opaque institutions without it
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
certification and a vague annual
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
so-called review by a board that
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
collects a whopping 10% of the EFA fees
 
02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
in fact hb20 brags that private
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
institutions have so-called maximum
 
02:13:11.709 --> 02:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
freedom to one determine your child's
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
educational needs and two set any
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum without review h B20 requires
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
neither open school board meetings nor
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
any parent teacher
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
conferences hb20 supports supporters say
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
parents not professionals should judge
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
their child's educational needs parents
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
may know a child's personal needs but
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
few know their academic needs too often
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
parents of children in unprofessional
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
private schools find out too late that
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
their child wasted precious months or
 
02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:48.589 align:start position:0%
their child wasted precious months or
years

02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
public scho parents and children need
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
real help not the hb20 scam reject H
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
reject hb20 as bad for our children bad
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
for public schools and bad for New
 
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:03.320 align:start position:0%

02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
the perspective of somebody who's lived
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
in many parts of the state I was brought
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
up in manad I attended a great public
 
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
school there I've lived in The Lakes
 
02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
Region for 10 years which is where I
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
brought up my kids and first put them
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
into public
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
school now I'm in Dover pursuing a work
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity of my husband so we've moved
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
here to the Sea Coast we really love it
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
here we've loved it all across the state
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
though I feel really privileged to have
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
seen so many parts of our beautiful
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
state and I'm currently house hunting in
 
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.870 align:start position:0%
state and I'm currently house hunting in
New

02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I find when I'm looking at
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
this bill that I'm trying to figure out
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
what community I should be looking for
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
should I be looking for a town that has
 
02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
a private school PR primarily because I
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
would need to make use of it or should I
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
be looking for a community that's away
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
from homeschoolers because I should be
 
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
worried about my tax dollars being
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
siphoned out of the school district and
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that my taxes will be on the
 
02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:36.709 align:start position:0%
the fact that my taxes will be on the
chopping

02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
chopping
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
block or should I be looking for a
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
community that has no private schools
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
anywhere near it for the highest
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
investment in the public school that I
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
would most likely be sending my my
 
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
children too it makes me nervous about
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
how we're going to set our towns up we
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
already have an issue in this T in this
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
whole state concerning inequities caused
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
public and and natural resources of the
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
community is if you're a community that
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
has a mountain or a lake or beach front
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
then you have a robust and deep tax well
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
to pull from and if you don't have that
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
then you just have to keep raising taxes
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
in Hope of meeting the service needs of
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
your community it's
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
unsustainable and as a a young family
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
owner uh young family and who's looking
 
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
to be a homeowner again it's it's
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
disconcerting further I watched the the
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
last committee on this with um Mr Kelli
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
who I see is not in with yall today but
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
he he made a pretty robust and I thought
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
shocking claim to suggest that families
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
of wealth who who are already sending
 
02:16:50.509 --> 02:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
their children to private schools that
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't bother to take a
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to $8,000 savings a year per
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
child and I don't know how he thinks
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
people get money but miss
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
Rano yes it's been two minutes wondering
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
testimony uh yeah that that's that's it
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
I I I just I find it laughable to
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that that rich folks wouldn't
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
take every single coupon of nearly
 
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per child uh offered to them
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's a it was a crazy claim then and
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
it should be brought up today and it
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
should be something that that continues
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be brought up because it was
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um please vote in expedient
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
to legislate on this uh and figure out a
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%

isn't
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%

02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
welcome to the education committee thank
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
you for having me I also have my three
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
children who would like to testify so
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to go quickly um I just
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
want to say that I was a product of the
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester public school system I
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
graduated at 15 because they were unable
 
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
to meet my needs for advanced education
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
and we chose to homeschool my children
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
um because the school systems couldn't
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
support the needs that they had as well
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
we've homeschooled them except for last
 
02:18:29.549 --> 02:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
year for a few months at a charter
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
school um since they were born and the
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
money that the state has allocated for
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
my children is being used by the public
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
school systems to educate other children
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
so if that allocation is supposed to be
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
for my my children why haven't we been
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
able to access it for classes and other
 
02:18:56.429 --> 02:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
things like that if the school system is
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
as efficient as they would like to say
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
that they are then how come they're not
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
being able to meet the needs without the
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
money that is being allocated for my
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
children from my own taxes so now I'm G
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
to pass it over to my youngest daughter
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:18.950 align:start position:0%

students and I haven't figured it out
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
folks in a public school as an
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
administrator for 22 years working with
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
students with
 
02:24:56.349 --> 02:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
Services I have to handle all these
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
students and I need funding to do
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
it and I don't see students in these
 
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
categories going into this
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
program so I ask you as my
 
02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives how are you going to
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone's treated
 
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
equal every one has access I'm obligated
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
under law to make
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
sure and that everyone's needs are
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
met I don't see how this program can do
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
it I am worried that a percentage of
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
this program is going to an entity
 
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
that's not being evaluated by
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
anyone I also am
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
worried but who is going to evaluate
 
02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
these students to make sure they're
 
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
learning who's going to make sure these
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
students are safe because the other
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
population that I haven't even brought
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
up is students that are under or they're
 
02:25:55.950 --> 02:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
been in court
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
involved you please wrap it up
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%

02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
all think about these students thank
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
you any
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions rep leus representative leus
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question I
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
was wondering if all of those students
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned if their me needs are
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
currently being met by the traditional
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
um local public school why would a
 
02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
parent remove them from that where
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
things were working for
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
them I I do not believe a parent will
 
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
remove him from my school my many of our
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
parents agree that are their needs are
 
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
being met however I do
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
believe that that um I don't have any
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
students I know someone use the term out
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
of District placement I don't have any
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
students in my school district out of
 
02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
District place right now because we work
 
02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
District place right now because we work
really

02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
hard but I do believe that if we're
 
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
going to provide something that sends
 
02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
money to another place it should be open
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
to all people and I haven't figured out
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
how a child and foster care system will
 
02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
have access to this program I haven't
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
figured out how a family that um has an
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
ESO student will have access to this
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
program so if our funding is going to go
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
there my tax dollars is going to go
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
there then everyone should be able to
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
have access so parents if we're truly
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
talking about choice they should have
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
choice so if they want to leave my
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
district to go they should have it but I
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
think that you need make sure we have to
 
02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
think that you need make sure we have to
have

02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
access um I
 
02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not
 
02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure your point is if needs
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
are being met as you said and you don't
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
have children wanting to go I'm not sure
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
what your objection is because nobody's
 
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
forcing people to go any place else so
 
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
it seems that the only people that would
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
take this up would be people whose needs
 
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
weren't being
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
met Am I Wrong oh I don't think you're
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
wrong representative but what I do think
 
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
that if a percentage of the distri
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
students in my district want to
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
go um that might not um be in those
 
02:28:26.190 --> 02:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
categories but Matt gives less money for
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
those kids in my district to receive
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
Services we won't have the f as much
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
funding thank
 
02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:36.150 align:start position:0%
funding thank
you

02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner Tanner Tanner uh thank you Mr
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
chair for uh taking my question and
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Kennedy for coming today
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
um as you stated you think that there
 
02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be less money to help these
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
children that are left at school if if
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
in fact the ones that are left behind
 
02:28:59.269 --> 02:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
are the ones uh 504 I AP that sort of
 
02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
thing do you think that um funding based
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
on Distributing to schools based on not
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
only economic status but also the
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
expense that may be incurred with uh
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
students who need uh special services
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative ten are you are
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
you saying it would be more fair if they
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
could go or more fair if they if we
 
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
didn't do funding would be more fair if
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
it was distributed from the state based
 
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
on um outcomes and also on the real
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
costs of educating students um students
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
that are homeless students that need
 
02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:42.030 align:start position:0%
that are homeless students that need
IEPs

02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
IEPs
 
02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
Etc I think it would always be fair if
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
we could distribute the appropriate
 
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
funding from federal and state um there
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
would be some more fairness but I also
 
02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
believe that if we take from our
 
02:29:55.950 --> 02:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
districts it'll become more difficult to
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
fund those programs for our most needy
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
you re luno re
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%

three and I'm trying to read it on
 
02:30:58.349 --> 02:30:58.359 align:start position:0%
another screen so I'm try to get you
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
know be in proximity of the microphone
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
and the text it says the scholarship
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
organization shall ensure that parents
 
02:31:08.349 --> 02:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
of students with disabilities receive
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
notice that participation in the EFA
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
program is a parental placement under 20
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
USC section 1412
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
Act along with an explanation of the
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
rights that parentally placed students
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
possess under idea and any applicable
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
state laws what does all that
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
mean um well I I think what we need to
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
say is that when a child is placed by a
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
parent um it's questionable depending on
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
the situation on whether the district
 
02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
has to support eventually making sure
 
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
that placement um meet the child's
 
02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
educational needs or whether the
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
district um does not have to and the
 
02:31:56.429 --> 02:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
parent loses re um supports from the
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
public school for the student with
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
special needs my concern is both ways
 
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
one is if a parent is placed and we find
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
that we have to provide will that
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
institution or will that um placement be
 
02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
able to support the children with these
 
02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
needs if we uh don't have to provide
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
services my concern is will the child
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
get the services they need to be
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
successful um and will the child will
 
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
the parent in that other institution
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
where the money is going provide a child
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
and help them through their educational
 
02:32:38.030 --> 02:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
um support so they become a citizen that
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
can actively participate in our society
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we're all trying
 
02:32:46.269 --> 02:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
to do is create citizens for the future
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
Kennedy that I see okay okay thank you
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and next okay thank
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%

work next we have Lindsay peard go ahead
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
Lindsay I promoted you welcome to
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
Ed good morning thank you um for the
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is Lindsay Pickard I am
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
here today representing myself as a
 
02:33:15.670 --> 02:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of New Hampshire and
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
product of the public education system
 
02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
as well as my district which is SAU
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
number 94 um where I currently sit as
 
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
the school board chair thank you for uh
 
02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
your time today and allowing me the
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify regarding my
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 20 um much of
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
what I had written today has already
 
02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
been stated so in order to be as
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
efficient as possible I will just
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
provide one uh little analogy and then
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
some support um the education funding
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
issue in New Hampshire kind of reads
 
02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
like a yo-yo diet blog since the
 
02:33:52.030 --> 02:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision more than 20 years
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
ago and to dat residents of New
 
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have been losing and gaining
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
valuable funding for their respective
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
districts kind of like we've been
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
watching infomercials on how to get
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
quickly the legislation has pitched
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
quick fixes like annual stop gaps to
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
current budget losses and some of my
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
favorites like last year the gimmick
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
one-time infrastructure adequacy c a
 
02:34:18.990 --> 02:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't get used to it it'll be gone next
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
year if you're me you can almost hear
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
that in Billy May's voice pitching his
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
cell at 2 am ultimately there has been
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
some phenomenal data provided by Barett
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
Christina from the New Hampshire School
 
02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
Board Association as well as um some
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
really good information from mayor Jim
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
um dones I apologize if I mispronounced
 
02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
his last name and some uh information
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
from General en residents some with
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
retired teachers some longtime Council
 
02:34:54.429 --> 02:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
people within our uh great state the
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line is
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
this while I agree that there will never
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
be a one-size fits
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
all I urge you as this at this level to
 
02:35:09.230 --> 02:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
itl this bill and work harder to solve
 
02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
the original problem the education
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
funding formula for the State of New
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we put half as much into
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
solving that problem perhaps the public
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
education system would have a greater
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
ability to meet the needs of all of the
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
students and
 
02:35:27.269 --> 02:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
families when I listened to this hearing
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
last week I noted that at that time
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
there were approximately 600 in favor
 
02:35:36.429 --> 02:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
and over 3,000 opposed to the bill I
 
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
think that gives us a pretty good
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
snapshot as to the benefits of public
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
education and yet does highlight a need
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
to do even better which is I think
 
02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
something that we're all striving for in
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
the end thank you for your time I will
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
submit my uh full testimony in writing
 
02:35:59.550 --> 02:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
repeated representative M ask question
 
02:36:04.349 --> 02:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr Aton chair and thank
 
02:36:07.469 --> 02:36:07.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr Picard uh I don't notice from
 
02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony from your comments that
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
you have a obviously a history and
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
commitment to public education as as I
 
02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
think do most of the us as well uh you
 
02:36:18.030 --> 02:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
being a Schoolboard member but I'd like
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
to ask you and I would ask others this
 
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
too as as we go along uh the the 60s the
 
02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
70s the 80s even the 1990s they just
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
seem to be to me and I was around for
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
those decade such a broad basis of
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
support for public schools that I have
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
seen change I think we've all seen Chang
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
AO we have this these movements for
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and for school choice and
 
02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
and movement to to private schools uh
 
02:36:53.269 --> 02:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
can you share maybe just one insight as
 
02:36:57.269 --> 02:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
to why this this major change has come
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
about in terms of attitudes and support
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
for public schools you being a a board
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
member so just to clarify you're you're
 
02:37:09.389 --> 02:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if I have some insight as to
 
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
why there's been a shift in uh such
 
02:37:15.269 --> 02:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
dedication to public education versus
 
02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for other education sure if
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
you could just maybe give us one Insight
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
from your perspective as to why there's
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
been such a dramatic shift in attitudes
 
02:37:27.550 --> 02:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
in the last couple
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
decades uh I think technology has a lot
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
to do with our shift in in that Focus we
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
have such a great ability to be in touch
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
with opportunities outside of just our
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
immediate Community our um you know our
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
ability to tap into other States other
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
countries other people uh that we might
 
02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
not have a relationship with in our
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
immediate Community I think has opened
 
02:37:59.950 --> 02:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
up the eyes to many that um we
 
02:38:03.070 --> 02:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
have we could have a better way of
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
educating youth ac across the board and
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
across the
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
much

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
luno representative luno ask question
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
you very much um Mard for joining us
 
02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
this morning and for your work on the
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
Winchester um um SAU 94 board uh boy the
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
folks in Winchester work really hard to
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
support their schools tax rate close to
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
$35 um per thousand um you talked about
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh looking at other approaches for um
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
for funding public education and um
 
02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
would you believe that um that that that
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
other approach could uh could continue
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
to support the high quality uh school
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
system that that you operate and um and
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the property tax on Winchester um
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers by more than $12 per
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
thousand well if you're speaking about
 
02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
SB 158 I already have a note here that I
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
am absolutely interested in learning
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
more about Alternatives I think that our
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
our tax rate actually
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
um it is in it is indicative of a
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
property poor area of New Hampshire and
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
on the surface it looks like we are
 
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
indeed offering above and beyond an
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
adequate education but really that tax
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
rate only shows you what we're able to
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
scrape by because of um
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
our area uh and our you know we don't we
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
mountain we don't have another Revenue
 
02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:51.389 align:start position:0%
mountain we don't have another Revenue
generating

02:39:51.389 --> 02:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you thank you very
 
02:39:57.230 --> 02:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
much Miss Picard thank you any further
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
wood Mr uh representative Woodcock
 
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock ask your
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
question please thank you Mr acting
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
chair uh Mr farar thank you for taking
 
02:40:11.070 --> 02:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
my question and I appreciate the fact
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
that you've been listening because my
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
comments go to a prior speaker you
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh you think the problem
 
02:40:21.389 --> 02:40:21.399 align:start position:0%
with the education system is the uh the
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
bouncing of the financial ball and how
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
we fund education uh and that should be
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
the how we address this although the
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
prior speaker indicated that french
 
02:40:32.269 --> 02:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
fries McDonald's and competition and
 
02:40:34.349 --> 02:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
widgets was the way to go so I want to
 
02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
know if you had a response to
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I do indeed actually I've
 
02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
heard that I've heard something similar
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh along a lot of this testimony I have
 
02:40:45.870 --> 02:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
been listening for many hours to it I
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a travesty that we are that
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh making decisions about education
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
driving it on profit when somebody
 
02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
profits from education there stands to
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
be a loss to another party so I think
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
line of properly educating our
 
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
chairman okay than you card thank you
 
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:37.000 align:start position:0%

committee I understand that you are also
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
in receipt of perhaps two of my written
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
testimonies and uh in the effort to make
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
use of the time I do want to Echo much
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
of what Miss Kate Baker deur mentioned
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
to start the day um and then I thought
 
02:41:59.309 --> 02:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful so I have to
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
identify who I am as well sorry about
 
02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
that I am the Headmaster of Mount R
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
Academy I'm a resident of Goan uh we are
 
02:42:09.070 --> 02:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
a private Catholic Independent School uh
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
we are also incorporated as a nonprofit
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
501c3 and according to the attorney
 
02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
general because we just barely make more
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
than $1 million a year in our gross
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
receipts we are subject to a financial
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
audit to make sure that we are
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
accountable at least in a fiscal sense
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
um our budget just in case people don't
 
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
know how private schools operate
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh we spend about $1.1 million
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
a year in tuition Revenue we take in
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere between $650 and $700,000 a
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
year and then because of the amount of
 
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
need-based financial aid we give out we
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
have to fund raise anywhere between
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
between 350 and
 
02:42:50.670 --> 02:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
$450,000 a year um so it's a very tight
 
02:42:53.790 --> 02:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
operation in that sense uh I do want to
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
read from our policy regarding
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination since that's been a huge
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation I hope that you
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
will hear the authenticity of my mouth
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
and my language uh because I don't know
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
that people are really hearing uh that
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
we don't discriminate and uh so I'm just
 
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
going to read this for you okay it says
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
we welcome students of any race Creed
 
02:43:18.389 --> 02:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
color and National or ethnic origin each
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
student is entitled to the same rights
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
privileges programs and activities
 
02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
available to all students of the school
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
we do not discriminate on the basis of
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
race color or national and ethnic origin
 
02:43:34.110 --> 02:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
in administration of any of our
 
02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
policies um and then on top of that too
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
because I think discrimination usually
 
02:43:43.469 --> 02:43:43.479 align:start position:0%
pivots on are we open to accepting
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
students who may be
 
02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
um of a higher you know learning need
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
who have needs that uh require more work
 
02:43:52.590 --> 02:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
more effort more attention and we
 
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
certainly are um a
 
02:43:58.269 --> 02:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
nice element of our reopening plan
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to stay in person was
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we hired more par Educators which
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
is trbl could you please wrap it up yes
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
I will wrap up and just say that we do
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
serve students who are on any type of
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
IEP ISP 504 plan thank
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:16.349 align:start position:0%
IEP ISP 504 plan thank
you

02:44:16.349 --> 02:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
Woodcock yeah I'm open to that question
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock yes um
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Milo had his hand up
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
before me I'll yield to
 
02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
him U thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um Mr Trum
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that you have reviewed um
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 20 and uh would you agree
 
02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
that there is no anti-discrimination
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
language in this bill as it sits right
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
now is that correct correct and I've got
 
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
a followup too all right thank you so to
 
02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge uh representative the
 
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
way the the funding works is it funds
 
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
the child not the school and it funds
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
the family not the school so I I would
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that that's not in the bill
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
because it it's not about the school as
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
much as it's about the
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
child thank you very much you're correct
 
02:45:09.790 --> 02:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
in that and I think that's one of the
 
02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
ways that uh there's an attempt here to
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
get around the issue of
 
02:45:14.910 --> 02:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language but here's
 
02:45:17.150 --> 02:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
the other question I have do you think
 
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate that if I send my
 
02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
child to a Christian school and they
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
discover that the my child is
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
gay and they dismiss him from that
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
school do you think that's appropriate
 
02:45:33.710 --> 02:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
using tax dollars to fund that
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
tuition well so again I I want to make
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
sure that it goes to the child first to
 
02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question I mean our mission
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
is that we believe all children are made
 
02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the image and likeness of God and
 
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
that they they should be treated
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
therefore as such so dismissal on
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
grounds such as those that you mentioned
 
02:45:52.590 --> 02:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
would not really I think be a good way
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
of treating that child um I think that
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be uh an a conversation
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the parents in which you
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
know it shouldn't go there I guess I'm
 
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna I'm G to leave it there
 
02:46:05.550 --> 02:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
if that's okay I hope that keeps it nice
 
02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
and short and simple for you yeah I and
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's the issue that I I
 
02:46:11.710 --> 02:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
have because if I want my child to have
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
a Christian education but they happen to
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
be trans gender for example uh and
 
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're rejected using tax dollars do
 
02:46:23.469 --> 02:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
you think that's
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
fair I think that at least I'll speak
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
from our school is that okay and how we
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's correct okay yeah I
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
I I'll speak from our school because I
 
02:46:34.110 --> 02:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
want people to hear there's a lot of
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
allegations out there about how we think
 
02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
right um we we have to work with all
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
state laws and regulations and and I
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
think that we also need to act on a
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
higher plane than that too but
 
02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we will work with any
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
parent and student who desire to come to
 
02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:52.910 align:start position:0%
parent and student who desire to come to
our

02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
school thank you very much thank you any
 
02:46:59.469 --> 02:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
further question representative wood C
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
Sanders and uh representative mull
 
02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:03.110 align:start position:0%
Sanders and uh representative mull
representative

02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman Mr try
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I I
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
started to write down uh when you were
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
speaking if you're private Catholic
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
independent 501c3 and I start to write
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
down your your goals the emission piece
 
02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
and and I get to the race call a
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
national origin but I didn't hear
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything there about uh students who are
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
gay lesbian bisexual transgender I heard
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
none of that in your statement about
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
Mission acceptance so if my daughter
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
who's transgender wanted to attend your
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
school and made that my son made that uh
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
aware of you to you in your mission
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
accept admission board prior to
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
admission would you accept them so so
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
let me be clear I guess it's kind of the
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
same answer as the last time if that's
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay we will work with any parent and
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
child who genuinely desires to come to
 
02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
our school and usually what we find sir
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
two U representative is they want to
 
02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
come to our school because they believe
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
in our mission they want to come to our
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
school because they're seeking placement
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
here so I think that that's like the the
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
bigger conversation rather than just
 
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
trying to say it's about this other
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
thing and that's been our experience
 
02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
I've been here for for 10 years
 
02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative every parent that I've
 
02:48:17.469 --> 02:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
seen they want to send their child here
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
and then we work with them to the extent
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
that they want to send their child here
 
02:48:21.950 --> 02:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
because they believe in the mission of
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
the school to followup Mr chairman yep
 
02:48:28.030 --> 02:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
so your your answer then is that you
 
02:48:30.670 --> 02:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
would not exclude my son or daughter if
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
you knew going in they were
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
transgender we would I'm just going to
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
say it this way if they want to be here
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
then I know that they believe in the
 
02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
mission of the school so we will work
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
with them to the extent that they
 
02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
believe in the mission of the school and
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr Trembley for taking my question
 
02:48:59.070 --> 02:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
um you advertised yourself as a Catholic
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
school so uh my I have a two-part
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
question one is um do you have an
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to upholding the beliefs and
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
practices of the Catholic church in your
 
02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:15.469 align:start position:0%
practices of the Catholic church in your
governance

02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
governance
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
and two what role do parents play in
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
your the governance of your school in
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
other words uh if representative
 
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
woodcock's transgendered daughter is at
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
your school is there some sort of
 
02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
governance board that could weigh in on
 
02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not that child is in
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
attendance yeah um can I go with the
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
second question first so sure yeah we we
 
02:49:42.750 --> 02:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
do have an independent board of
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
directors that that I report to to um
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I as because we're incorporating the
 
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as a
 
02:49:52.269 --> 02:49:52.279 align:start position:0%
501c3 um they you know they they have to
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
I think live within a certain geographic
 
02:49:58.110 --> 02:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
area of where we are um we have policies
 
02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
and procedures much like public schools
 
02:50:01.870 --> 02:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
because some of those are just really
 
02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
good practices and um parents are very
 
02:50:07.229 --> 02:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
involved um it's actually interesting
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
here a lot of people wonder why we don't
 
02:50:11.550 --> 02:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
have a PTO of some kind and that's cuz
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
parents are here every day and and that
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
is the nature of a
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
of a partnership in in this setting
 
02:50:19.389 --> 02:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
between a private school and those
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
parents the parents obviously are
 
02:50:23.950 --> 02:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
sacrificing to send their child there um
 
02:50:25.309 --> 02:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
and two your other question I believe
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
about upholding the teachings of the
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
Catholic church is that correct that was
 
02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
the first one yeah yeah yeah so we're
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're very authentic in that and we're
 
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
faithful in that sense and and we do
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
believe in the fullness of what the
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
church teaches um we get the question
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
all the time and I've done probably
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
thousands of Tours before you would
 
02:50:44.990 --> 02:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
imagine do I have to be this to to be
 
02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
here and we always say no we are who we
 
02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
are and if the church is universal we
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
love all people um and if you really
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
desire to be here then I'm sure you're
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
going to want to work with us and we're
 
02:50:59.389 --> 02:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
going to want to work with you um so I
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:51:09.870 --> 02:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
try for taking my question um first if I
 
02:51:11.710 --> 02:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
may I'd like to thank you on be thank
 
02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
the Catholic schools on behalf of my
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
apist friends who T because with I know
 
02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
quite a few atheists that actually
 
02:51:20.429 --> 02:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
Delight me going to Catholic schools my
 
02:51:23.469 --> 02:51:23.479 align:start position:0%
question is if you're aware of the I
 
02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
think it said B the gay lesbian and
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
straight education Network work that
 
02:51:30.429 --> 02:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
they've done over the last two decades
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
and their most recent 2020 survey showed
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of U bullying harassment
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
and assault of LBT lb lgbtq students in
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
public district schools and private Rel
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I'm wondering if you're
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
seeing students coming from the public
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
schools in order to be safer within your
 
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
Halls yeah I don't know if I could speak
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
to the the specifics of like are they
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
are they because of their their
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
treatment and perhaps some of what
 
02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with is that why they
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
come here um yeah but we do have
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
children who come here because they they
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
I could tell that they fear if they were
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
in a public school they would be treated
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
differently um that's not every child
 
02:52:15.469 --> 02:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
who comes here though and uh I guess I I
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to say that it's always the
 
02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
case that in those four walls that are
 
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
not these four walls these things are
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen right but um we we do
 
02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
have anecdotal situations where people
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
students come here because they feel
 
02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
students come here because they feel
safer

02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:34.349 --> 02:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr acting chair and thank
 
02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr trom for for testifying and
 
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
taking time to be here uh the bla
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm sure you're familiar with
 
02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
goes back to the 1880s and many States
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire have versions of
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
the Blain Amendment which precludes
 
02:52:53.389 --> 02:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
public money to go to secular sectarian
 
02:52:55.070 --> 02:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
Catholics basically he aimed at
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
Catholics uh schools it was probably uh
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
a great example of 19 century Prejudice
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
now the espanosa versus Montana case
 
02:53:06.229 --> 02:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
last year US Supreme Court has o
 
02:53:08.229 --> 02:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
overturned that so there a whole new
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
landscape of which I'm sure you're quite
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
familiar but my question is are you
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
aware that Canada has a very long
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
tradition of directing public money to
 
02:53:21.150 --> 02:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools did you know that yeah
 
02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
aware um of of that I'm aware that
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
America may be one of the few countries
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
that do not take advantage of the
 
02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
Catholic School System um most of Europe
 
02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
has traditionally probably Canada does
 
02:53:38.830 --> 02:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
um the bla amendments I'm also aware of
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
the good thing is that you are all
 
02:53:42.269 --> 02:53:42.279 align:start position:0%
elected to discuss those very weighty
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
things all the time I'm just trying to
 
02:53:44.399 --> 02:53:45.349 align:start position:0%
things all the time I'm just trying to
educate

02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
educate
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
children so um yeah and and obviously
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
you could make the argument that's a
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
double standard and things like that but
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
um for me we're just trying to do the
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
next right thing by the kid who comes in
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
front of us so I'll take that as a yes
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
you do know that Canada gives public
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
money to Catholic schools thank you so
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
much yeah I am aware of that in America
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say this is one of the few
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I mean just Statewide we don't have
 
02:54:14.910 --> 02:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
a a uniform um policy on that at a
 
02:54:17.710 --> 02:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
federal level for sure okay thank you Mr

the board of school committee here in
 
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I'm here to
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
to express my deep concern over house
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
Bell 20 and its certain impact on public
 
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire and more
 
02:56:04.389 --> 02:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
specifically the detrimental effect it
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
will have on the Manchester public
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
school system our school districts
 
02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
already facing a precipitous budget
 
02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
shortfall due to already declining
 
02:56:15.070 --> 02:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment predominantly due the
 
02:56:18.830 --> 02:56:18.840 align:start position:0%

million increase in retirement costs
 
02:56:23.229 --> 02:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
from the state the Hampshire school
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
funding commission has highlighted the
 
02:56:27.229 --> 02:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
fact that the current school funding
 
02:56:29.550 --> 02:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
system has created vast inequities
 
02:56:32.110 --> 02:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
between communities all across our state
 
02:56:34.510 --> 02:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
and highlighted how many local taxpayers
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
are expected to compensate for lack of
 
02:56:38.590 --> 02:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
wealth in their community in order to
 
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
provide their children with the same
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education as a wealthier
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
community this is further exacerbated in
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
the state's largest city where we have a
 
02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
tax cap that prevents investment in
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
schools even when there's a s Surplus in
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue house spill 20 will widen these
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
inequities and create far and create
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
large population of children finding
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
themselves further from educational
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
Economic Opportunity by diverting
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
funding from our public schools to
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
private schools and homeschoolers
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the family of a Beach
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
Street Schools students
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
the poorest School in New Hampshire as
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
far as a high high percentage of student
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
students with unframe reduced lunch um
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
will most likely not be able to re
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
afford the remainder of a tuition bill
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
after applying their Esa funds and the
 
02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
private school will still remain Out Of
 
02:57:36.030 --> 02:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
Reach the children will then remain at
 
02:57:38.229 --> 02:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
Beach Street but with far fewer
 
02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
resources for that school to use for
 
02:57:42.910 --> 02:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
textbooks and teach teachers this bill
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
will leave New Hampshire already
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
struggling public schools with larger
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
class sizes fewer supports and no
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
ability to address outdated school
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
buildings thereby creating a greater
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
disparity between the Haves and the Have
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
Nots the disparity disp
 
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacts communities
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
of color and is a form of discrimination
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
why not spend our energy and our time
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
and resources to fix education for all
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students let's let's if
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
you feel public schools are falling
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
short don't sell them out but instead
 
02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
Shore them up let's work to make them
 
02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
the best in the nation because New
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could do that with the support
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
of all of its leaders thank you you've
 
02:58:34.469 --> 02:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
exceeded the time uh much any uh do we
 
02:58:36.990 --> 02:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative M
 
02:58:39.429 --> 02:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr R shair thank you m Juan
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I I just got a a text
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
message from uh a Manchester uh resident
 
02:58:50.349 --> 02:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh I guess a former School official and
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
she just wanted uh us to ask you about
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
the Manchester budget being millions of
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
dollars over the tax cap despite a
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
thousand kids uh pulling out of the
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
district this is from her message so I I
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if those are the the right
 
02:59:07.309 --> 02:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
numbers but could you speak to being
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars over the tax cap
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
despite a thousand kids calling out of
 
02:59:14.830 --> 02:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
the district
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
02:59:20.030 --> 02:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
relevant yeah I'm little bit questioning
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
the um the question as well tax cap is
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
um is um not a I'm sorry um it doesn't
 
02:59:34.229 --> 02:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
really the tax cap this seems like a
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
non-er question this is not relevant to
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
the to to hp20 whatsoever right you've
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
overruled other questions so I would I
 
02:59:43.630 --> 02:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
would suggest this is not relevant at
 
02:59:45.550 --> 02:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
what whatever Mr chairman how is this
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
relevant agre I agree yeah thank you m
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair I passed this question I believe
 
02:59:53.550 --> 02:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of this message that was just
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
sent to me had to do with the the the
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
current efficiency and efficacy of of uh
 
03:00:02.670 --> 03:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
the public schools in in uh in Miss
 
03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
want's district and to give her a chance
 
03:00:07.389 --> 03:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
to speak to uh that that person should
 
03:00:09.269 --> 03:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
call her up and ask her
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
not I'd be happy to address this um so
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have the lowest per
 
03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
pupil spending in the entire state of
 
03:00:20.229 --> 03:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
any of any school district that that
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
maintains elementary middle and high
 
03:00:28.110 --> 03:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
schools um we are incredibly underfunded
 
03:00:29.469 --> 03:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
given the fact that our students have
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
the greatest needs we have the highest
 
03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
percentages of students with free
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
reduced launch the highest number of
 
03:00:37.229 --> 03:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
students that are English language
 
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
Learners and also the highest percentage
 
03:00:42.190 --> 03:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
of students that are special needs
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
students so we have a great number of
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
needs in Manchester and they have been
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
undermat not because of the local
 
03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer the local taxpayer has done
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
their share we have tried very hard but
 
03:00:59.950 --> 03:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
um it is difficult when you have do have
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
a tax cap for one and when you don't
 
03:01:06.190 --> 03:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
have the um resources like a l like
 
03:01:08.510 --> 03:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have said we don't
 
03:01:10.750 --> 03:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
have a lake near us we don't have high
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
property valuation so because we are
 
03:01:15.790 --> 03:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
sort of middle Ro property valuation the
 
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
amount our taxpayers pay in order to
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
fund an adequate education in Manchester
 
03:01:22.710 --> 03:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:01:26.190 --> 03:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
considerable and um and inadequate
 
03:01:28.990 --> 03:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
still thank you very much for that uh
 
03:01:32.229 --> 03:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
useful perspective appreciate
 
03:01:32.239 --> 03:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
useful perspective appreciate
it

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
l representative M question Lun I'm
 
03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Luna you have a question
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
03:01:44.190 --> 03:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Miss la for uh
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
for being with us today and for for all
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
of your efforts on the um the the um
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester school committee uh that's a
 
03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's a very important job and one of
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
the things you you referred to in your
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
testimony was this projected um
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in the state Grant to the
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District uh in the
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
amount of about $12 million and I was
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could sort of speak to
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
that the importance of House Bill 623
 
03:02:14.710 --> 03:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
and Senate bill 14
 
03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
in in addressing that
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
shortfall sure um so any money that
 
03:02:24.269 --> 03:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester gets is sorely needed I will
 
03:02:26.429 --> 03:02:26.439 align:start position:0%
say though that the money that comes in
 
03:02:28.269 --> 03:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
through some of these bills is one-time
 
03:02:30.910 --> 03:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
money and doesn't help fix a lot of our
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
problems which are Staffing problems and
 
03:02:36.990 --> 03:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
programmatic problems um and not onetime
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
spending problems so I will say it
 
03:02:42.190 --> 03:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me when we want to when we want
 
03:02:46.110 --> 03:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
to solve problems in New Hampshire less
 
03:02:49.469 --> 03:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
by looking at the overall way way funds
 
03:02:52.910 --> 03:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
public schools and look more at one-time
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
Solutions of like throwing this this
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
little bag of money at a problem and
 
03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
that little bag of money at a problem
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
not that millions of dollars is a little
 
03:03:04.190 --> 03:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
bag of money but but it doesn't begin to
 
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
compare to the the um the issues that we
 
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
face um to in order to give all of our
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
students the best education possible and
 
03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:14.590 align:start position:0%
students the best education possible and
equitable

03:03:14.590 --> 03:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
03:03:18.030 --> 03:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
education thank thank you very much Miss

03:03:51.269 --> 03:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
believe uh with you would you believe
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that if we had a good adequacy funding
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
formula that was
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
consistent and that was providing the
 
03:04:05.469 --> 03:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
amounts of money throughout the the the
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh state that education would improve
 
03:04:11.950 --> 03:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
all over the state including Manchester
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then if that were in place and if
 
03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
that was happening then school choice
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
would have a place somewhere along the
 
03:04:24.670 --> 03:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
line um but it would not be taking away
 
03:04:30.429 --> 03:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
from uh the um the students and uh the
 
03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
education throughout our
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
state thank you Barbara for the question
 
03:04:41.229 --> 03:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
um and please I can't hear you hone so
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
repres representative Shaw thank you for
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
the question and can you hear me
 
03:04:49.469 --> 03:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
now yes okay
 
03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say uh I I think if
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
we adequately funded education across
 
03:04:57.630 --> 03:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
the state that then school choice could
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
occur Even in our within our own
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
District we have 22 schools I think if
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
we they were all adequately funded and a
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
school down on Beach Street wasn't
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
different than a school on Smith Road
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
that we could allow you know even school
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
choice with in our school district which
 
03:05:18.510 --> 03:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen now I um I believe
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
that students need to to have what what
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
each individual student needs charter
 
03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
schools are fine they're Public Schools
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
but I think giving money to um private
 
03:05:34.750 --> 03:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
schools and home schools is is full
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%

new in New Hampshire moved here from
 
03:06:32.429 --> 03:06:32.439 align:start position:0%
Colorado and uh also I grew up in China
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
you all know People's Republic of China
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
where parents had no choices we had only
 
03:06:41.229 --> 03:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
one school to go to the government
 
03:06:44.349 --> 03:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
schools and the home school schools were
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
recently banned even though there were
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
only small amount of students who could
 
03:06:51.630 --> 03:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
not get adequate education and who have
 
03:06:54.510 --> 03:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
health mental issues to stay home to be
 
03:06:56.590 --> 03:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooled so anyway lots of
 
03:06:58.590 --> 03:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants came to America I just wanted
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
to tell you that because America is
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
still The Shining hell on the city for
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom that freedom includes freedom to
 
03:07:10.229 --> 03:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
choose parental rights are the
 
03:07:10.239 --> 03:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
choose parental rights are the
fundamental

03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
03:07:13.710 --> 03:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
rights otherwise
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
our kids will be just like China belong
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
to the state belong to the Villages then
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
you have the certain political class of
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
people to determine that what they
 
03:07:27.229 --> 03:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
should learn how they should learn
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
instead of our kids should be focus our
 
03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
education the quality education today is
 
03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
a no longer I feel like the focus of our
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we have seen enough of
 
03:07:42.510 --> 03:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
that during the shutdowns right lots of
 
03:07:45.469 --> 03:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
kids come home cannot get adequate
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
education except the rich like Governor
 
03:07:51.309 --> 03:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
newon can send his kids go to private
 
03:07:54.030 --> 03:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
schools in person but our public school
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
kids lots of immigrant kids are stuck at
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
home and have mental crisis and their
 
03:08:03.309 --> 03:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
parents had to work left them home alone
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
so there are lots of story like that so
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire I just wanted to
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
share my story with you that you will
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
see America and still a country for for
 
03:08:16.630 --> 03:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
freedom to choose and still for parents
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
rights we are not China yet so I
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%

education hi can you hear me yes we can
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
I had prepared uh my own statement but
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
um a fellow a fellow friend of mine that
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
is a um a school teacher actually asked
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
me to read her statement um and just the
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
reason why is mainly because for fear of
 
03:49:34.990 --> 03:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
Retribution she didn't um she can't say
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
she's I'm writing um so this is good
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm writing to share with you
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
why after 15 years of teaching in the
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school system I am in
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
total support of hb20 I'm a decorated
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
teacher holding multiple degrees
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
certifications and many years of
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
experience working within several of my
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
District's professional committees I am
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
a mentor teacher within the district
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
where I am often paired up with newly
 
03:50:06.269 --> 03:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
hired Educators and I have also opened
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
my classroom up to college level
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
students I had the pleasure of teaching
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
across several different grade levels
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
and I also teach education classes for
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
one of the state's well-known
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
universities to say that education is a
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
part of who I am would be an
 
03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
understatement I feel it is important
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
that this be known by all in attendance
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
today and that it is there and that
 
03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
there has been a major shift in
 
03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
education in the last three to five
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
years and that this shift is trending
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
away from concrete instruction and
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
shifting towards a focus more on the
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
students social emotional needs SL
 
03:50:46.149 --> 03:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
behaviors and teachers learning and
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
implementing instructional programs it
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
is my opinion that we have especially
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
moved away from decomposing standards
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
time well spent in collaborative
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
meetings awareness of what students need
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
to know by the end of the year along
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
with rigorous direct instruction to
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
teaching Educators how to teach programs
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
and curriculums that move students along
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
far too quickly and leave zero time for
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
managing small group instruction which
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
would be specific to students needs our
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
Title One programs don't move students
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
through quickly I don't believe the
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
model is being implemented the way it
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
should be and classroom teachers are not
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
able to give skilled specific
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
instruction to students with gaps due to
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh an overwhelmingly full plate of this
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
concept of more more more these children
 
03:51:41.309 --> 03:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
are becoming lifelong tital wers instead
 
03:51:44.349 --> 03:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
of solidifying unknowns and moving on
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
with grade level instruction students
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
are continuing to fall farther and
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
farther behind year after year and
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
schools are just allowing this and
 
03:51:56.149 --> 03:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
sending them through to the next year
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
teachers are learning something new
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
every couple of years instead of
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
mastering quality instruction for the
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
standards they are responsible for at
 
03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
their grade level districts are
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%

03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chair I was
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
just wondering um Miss Penza if um I
 
03:52:42.269 --> 03:52:42.279 align:start position:0%
think I don't want to assume but you're
 
03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh feeling the same sentiments uh are
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
you an
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
educator uh I'm not an educator but um
 
03:52:52.229 --> 03:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling yep I'm feeling the exact
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
same sentiments my personal testimony
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
was going to be more so of what I've had
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with in regards with my own two
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
children and um and just knowing that I
 
03:53:06.149 --> 03:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
that I know that school choice is
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
essential and it really needs to come
 
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
from parent parents um there was another
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
statement I was going to read from my
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
girlfriend that is a former teacher she
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
just left during the pandemic in
 
03:53:20.110 --> 03:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester she's a math teacher and she
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
literally says the same exact things
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
that are here and um was there working
 
03:53:28.510 --> 03:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
in that system for the last five years
 
03:53:31.469 --> 03:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
and the stories are absolutely appalling
 
03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
and there are this isn't about this
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
really isn't at all about um you know
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
vouchers and and taking anything away
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the public schools and I believe
 
03:53:44.830 --> 03:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
there are so many amazing Public School
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
teachers that want this too so this is
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
about choice and this is about what's
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
best for kids and uh that's what that's
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
why it needs to happen something needs
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
to change here and maybe this will make
 
03:53:58.510 --> 03:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
things change Miss Penza uh would you
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
please uh submit that written testimony
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%

Spencer she goes okay I thank you um Mr
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my uh testimony today
 
03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
and to all of the committee members for
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
listening um to the Public's um
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
viewpoints on on this bill um I think
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
this bill should be called the dismantle
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
Public Schools act because with New
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school districts facing
 
03:55:23.710 --> 03:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
unprecedented challenges due to the
 
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
current funding crisis and the added
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
burdens of covid uh we're talking about
 
03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
pulling money out of that very stress
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
system we're in a perfect storm and this
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
bill quite frankly could be the gust of
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
wind that wipes some of our smaller
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
Local Schools right off the map um I
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
keep hearing that zip code should not
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
Define a child's future and I completely
 
03:55:49.950 --> 03:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
agree with this sentiment I just come to
 
03:55:52.710 --> 03:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
a very different conclusion about how we
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
best serve each child I believe we do
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
that by investing our resources funding
 
03:56:01.349 --> 03:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
and energy into making Public Schools
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
the very best they can be um and not
 
03:56:06.630 --> 03:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
diverting tax dollars only when
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to make very specific need
 
03:56:12.030 --> 03:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
needs of individual children shouldn't
 
03:56:14.590 --> 03:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
all our kids have internet and computer
 
03:56:17.149 --> 03:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
enrichment opportunities and engaged
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
learning I don't want to see these
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
things just reserved for those who might
 
03:56:24.149 --> 03:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
have parents that can help them navigate
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
school vouches um as a taxpayer I
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
request that this committee seek
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
independent financial analysis of this
 
03:56:34.149 --> 03:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill's impact the scenarios presented by
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner adal blute seemed wildly
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
unrealistic to me why wouldn't every
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
parent with a child currently
 
03:56:42.670 --> 03:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or in private schools and
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
we heard 20,000 today approximately why
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they apply for this money and
 
03:56:51.149 --> 03:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
withdraw it from our local
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
districts as Finance chairman Neil Kirk
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
said in reference to SB 193 and that was
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
a bill that was much more conservative
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
in breath than hb20 after it went
 
03:57:05.229 --> 03:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
through committee he said I was not
 
03:57:07.269 --> 03:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
elected to downshift costs on my
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
constituents so I cannot support this
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill I think that applies to SB uh hb20
 
03:57:18.070 --> 03:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um and I would just say that
 
03:57:21.630 --> 03:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
to those who vote for this bill that
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
they lose the claim to be fiscal
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
conservatives or Defenders of the New
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer because this bill
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
diverts money right away from taxpayers
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
and shifts the cost down to local
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
districts so I thank you for taking my
 
03:57:40.830 --> 03:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um I will be happy to take any
 
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
questions Spencer are there
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%

education uh I don't have him did you
 
03:58:11.309 --> 03:58:11.319 align:start position:0%

03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%

please are you available to talk am I
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
just had to figure out how to unmute it
 
03:58:52.670 --> 03:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the whole screen went blank and then I
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
came back very strange I'm darus hoeny
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a mother of six I homeschooled my
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak up please we
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
can't hear you okay my name is darus
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
heny I'm a mother of six homeschooled
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
children I'm a former board member from
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
Nash repres presenting myself I favor
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
choice but I oppose this bill it
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
undermines the independence of private
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
education it will it has to it's our tax
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
dollars we need accountability it will
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
also introduce an income tax or
 
03:59:25.469 --> 03:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax because you're adding a
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars to the adequacy
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
of private education so this is not the
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
solution this is a centralized solution
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
we need to decentralize I believe in the
 
03:59:38.429 --> 03:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
public schools and I believe there
 
03:59:40.590 --> 03:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's a model in Canada Edmonton
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
Canada that has um an alternate learning
 
03:59:45.870 --> 03:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
program that's been operation for 25
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
years they have listed online and in my
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
test my testimony which I submitted I've
 
03:59:54.189 --> 03:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
got the link there's over 27 programs
 
03:59:56.429 --> 03:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
that they've got from Arts to music to
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
bilingual education to science where
 
04:00:00.670 --> 04:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
they have choice in the schools they
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
have communities of parents and they set
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
them up I'd recommend that we have
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
little school boards over each School
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
building and we create those communities
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
create the choice that parents are
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
looking for because they're screaming to
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
get out of the schools especially with
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
remote they're screaming to get out
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
because they see what the kids are
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
learning in terms of social emotional
 
04:00:21.149 --> 04:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
learning instead of basic academics so
 
04:00:23.429 --> 04:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
some want out they want Alternatives
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
give it to them in the schools we don't
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
have to continue with this centralized
 
04:00:32.110 --> 04:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
approach you need a a limited Choice a v
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
a voice right there at your schools we
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
fix oh I'm sorry I guess I'm done oh I
 
04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
got 15 15 seconds when we fixed the home
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
education law it went from 1990 to 2012
 
04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
it took 22 years for parents to join
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
together to fix that parents can't fix
 
04:00:51.149 --> 04:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
this you have to enable them to have a
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
voice to fix their own schools and
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%

my name is Nal Gedo and I am from
 
04:01:33.550 --> 04:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
Winchester I'm testifying on behalf and
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
I um on behalf of myself and I'm in
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill hb20 our school
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
budget in town was cut by $1.6 Million
 
04:01:43.630 --> 04:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
last year by a group of people whose
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
mentality and goal is to have zero
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
government control throughout the state
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
this bill supports that effort zero
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
government control which is spelled out
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
in the bill under 194 e-7 Roman numeral
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
2 our town is still fighting to this day
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
with each other over that cut passing
 
04:02:02.429 --> 04:02:02.439 align:start position:0%
this bill will tear our community apart
 
04:02:04.269 --> 04:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
further by supporting their efforts in
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
giving money to private schools under
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
the mask of a savings account
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
this bill takes our children and divides
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
them into private institutions by
 
04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
throwing money at parents in hopes of
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
them leaving the public education system
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
is also not appealing to lower income
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
individuals like most of the folks in
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
Winchester who may not have a way to get
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
their children for a private school or a
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
child or their child who may not even be
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
accepted to the school either this bill
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
basically segregates our population in
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
Winchester and tears our community apart
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
stripping every child of their
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
connection to their neighbors community
 
04:02:39.870 --> 04:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
and the government as a whole this bill
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
also devalues our long history of
 
04:02:43.710 --> 04:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
education an institution older than
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
anyone listening to me speak right now
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
our history needs to be saved this bill
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
will hurt our school and it is just
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
another nail in the coffin of killing
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
the Winchester's public school system I
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
would think that in a room of elected
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
officials that you would agree that this
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill effectively takes away the control
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the governing bodies of New Hampshire
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
and puts our tax dollars taxpayer money
 
04:03:04.110 --> 04:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
into the hands of private institutions
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
was which is exactly what that group in
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
our town aimed to do when they cut
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
Winchester their school budget the
 
04:03:11.790 --> 04:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman also the gentleman who spoke
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
earlier mentioned that the Catholic
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
School school system does not
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
discriminate what that does not mean is
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
that they do do not IND Doctrine so in
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
the town like Winchester whose schools
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
will shut down that means that our
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
low-income students will have no other
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
choice but to attend a private school
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
while they will try to indoctrinate them
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
with their values and missions thus not
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
supporting a free and fair Education
 
04:03:36.550 --> 04:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
Without discrimination there is no other
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
option for Winchester please please itl
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%

all of us with special individual needs
 
04:04:40.590 --> 04:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
my story is very long so I'm just going
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
to give you the basis of who we are and
 
04:04:45.389 --> 04:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
you can ask me any question you want um
 
04:04:49.950 --> 04:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
that pertains to any of those so um I am
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
a adult who went to public school and
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
private school I sent my nine-year-old
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
now to Catholic school we are not
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
Catholic um when she was five we had to
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
get a lot of Assessments and testing
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
done we found that she had a lot of
 
04:05:06.189 --> 04:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
special needs um I pulled my daughter
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
from private school in C to public
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
school because what I thought was that
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
they were going to be able to help her
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
she would be able to get an IEP a 504
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I was hearing from a lot of
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
Professionals in my community um that is
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
not what
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
happened my
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
daughter is one that fell through the
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
cracks I feel like there are those with
 
04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
um extreme special needs there are those
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
who don't there are those who are very
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
poor there are those who are
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
not like I feel like sometimes the
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
middle ground just gets lost so I fought
 
04:05:44.110 --> 04:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
for a year and a half to try and help my
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
daughter get the education that she
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
deserved a free and you know reasonable
 
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is the fap education um
 
04:05:53.189 --> 04:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
all we got was stress
 
04:05:55.870 --> 04:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety um you know my daughter was
 
04:05:58.030 --> 04:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
doing horribly she was put in danger
 
04:05:59.550 --> 04:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
twice in the public school system and
 
04:06:02.910 --> 04:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
publicly humiliated by her teacher um
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
and when I fought I got nowhere I went
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
to the states I went to nonprofits um
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
they all couldn't believe my story so
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%

04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
we spend $4,400 less than the state
 
04:09:01.389 --> 04:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
average that's 26% less even with this

hurt local communities I cannot support
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
any bill that uses state tax dollars to
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
fund education Freedom accounts when our
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
Public Schools continue to not be
 
04:10:03.870 --> 04:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
properly funded and the state continues
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
to not fund the true cost of inadequate
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
education thank you for the opportunity
 
04:10:09.790 --> 04:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
and I hope the committee does not
 
04:10:09.800 --> 04:10:10.990 align:start position:0%
and I hope the committee does not
support

04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
hb20 thank you very much superintendent
 
04:10:17.149 --> 04:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
one sure thank thank you very much Mr
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
superintendent for uh joining us um uh
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh you'd mentioned the uh
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
the tax rate in um the school tax rate
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
in um in New Boston uh could you say
 
04:10:41.109 --> 04:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
what that is again we're projecting next
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
year to be
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
$17.50 and then of course the Statewide
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
educational property tax um which by the
 
04:10:50.429 --> 04:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
way is uh local money that's raised
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
locally retained locally and um
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
categorized as state aid is on top of
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
that okay and would would uh would you
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
um um be interested to support a school
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
funding reform that uh would would
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
improve the Equity uh for students and
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and potentially even see a
 
04:11:15.149 --> 04:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
property tax reduction in New Boston of
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
nearly $7 per thousand I
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
would would that be more in line with an
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
average well it's fasting um and with
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
all due respect to commissioner edel BL
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
when he testified last week he said that
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
school districts are spending
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
$20,000 so if that's the true cost of an
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
adequate education I would submit to you
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
that this committee and the house and
 
04:11:41.229 --> 04:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate have a responsibility to
 
04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
truly fund an adequate education and
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
right now that is not the case and local
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
property taxes are impacted local
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
communities continue to be hurt we're
 
04:11:53.950 --> 04:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
driving uh seniors out who are on fixed
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
incomes and this is in a community that
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
has the fourth lowest cost in the entire
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
State thank you very much thank you very
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
Le thank you I'm curious as to um your
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
definition of a public education does
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
that mean the public funds schools or
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the public funds an
 
04:12:29.630 --> 04:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
education for each child in the
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
state well the definition as a
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent that I would follow are
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards in Ed 306 which
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
clearly outlin lines all the required
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
elements that school districts are
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
required to offer to students so all of
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
those uh requirements along with the
 
04:12:48.830 --> 04:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
federal mandates we have a significant
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
number of unfunded mandates that are
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
posed on our local schools that I think
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
are well documented within the history
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
of New
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much further
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see thank you very
 
04:13:05.149 --> 04:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
much superintendent thank
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
you okay next we have uh Kim Spencer Kim
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
education on can you hear me now yes
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman for the
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today um my name is
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
Kim Spencer I live in Manchester I am a
 
04:13:27.990 --> 04:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
former educator a former owner of a
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
large Child Care Center that served 150
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
kids a foster parent until we adopted
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
one of our foster daughters and most
 
04:13:36.520 --> 04:13:37.710 align:start position:0%
one of our foster daughters and most
importantly

04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
04:13:39.389 --> 04:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as a mother of seven
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
children you can say my life has been
 
04:13:45.990 --> 04:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
about caring for serving educating and
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
advocating for children as I've worn all
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
these hats in my life I have come to
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
learn and I think we can all agree that
 
04:13:55.469 --> 04:13:55.479 align:start position:0%
there is no one size fits all for
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
children not in the way they are raised
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly not in the way they learn
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
kids learn at their own speed in their
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
own way and in their own style and many
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
benefit from learning in different
 
04:14:06.640 --> 04:14:07.950 align:start position:0%
benefit from learning in different
environment

04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
I was going to tell you about my own
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
personal experience but last week you
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
heard many stories on that I will just
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
summarize that you can't imagine what it
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
is like to raise a child who thinks they
 
04:14:20.189 --> 04:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
are stupid and the amazing moment when
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
you find the right educational fit for
 
04:14:24.670 --> 04:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
them and they look at you and say I am
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
smart I can learn I will add that a
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
child can feel this way in any school
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
district we used to live in Bedford a
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
school district acknowledged for being
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
one of the best and moved to Manchester
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be closer to and more school options
 
04:14:40.750 --> 04:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
for our family last week as I listened
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
to the testimonies there's one thing I
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
noticed the arguments against the bill
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
are mainly about money and the worry of
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
dismantling the public school system and
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
the argument for this bill is mainly
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
about families and our wonderful kids
 
04:14:56.590 --> 04:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to advocate for or
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
fight for because we want them to be
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
successful I will add that many of the
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
kids asking for scholarships and looking
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
for school choice as we heard from Kate
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
demerge this morning is because they are
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against either for
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
their special needs their colors or
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
their own personal
 
04:15:18.030 --> 04:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs um I was educated by the public
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
schools and most of my children have
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
been educated by them but I've been
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
alive for 48 years now and for all those
 
04:15:28.349 --> 04:15:28.359 align:start position:0%
48 years I have been hearing that the
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
public school system is not is
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
underfunded and not getting enough money
 
04:15:35.469 --> 04:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
and that it isn't working as well as we
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
would like to because it needs more
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
money I'm beginning to think there isn't
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
enough money to fix them the school
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
system am I out of time I'm sorry yes
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay basically I just think that I to
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
summarize is just that this is s shows
 
04:15:56.429 --> 04:15:56.439 align:start position:0%
us that the school system public school
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
system is currently not working and it
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
definitely is needing change and I think
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good start to it um and
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
will'll give parents choices thank you
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%

okay honorable members of the New
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house education committee we
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
are blessed in New Hampshire to have
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
some of the best public schools in the
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
entire country but even the best public
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
schools don't work for outliers my name
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
is Ragnar Kemp a citizen of New
 
04:16:59.109 --> 04:16:59.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since birth and I represent
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
myself in support of hb20 because I was
 
04:17:01.560 --> 04:17:02.830 align:start position:0%
myself in support of hb20 because I was
an

04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
outlier my parents decided to homeschool
 
04:17:08.910 --> 04:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
me because they two were outliers
 
04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
however that plan was blocked when my
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
father died of cancer when I was just 4
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
years old after that we couldn't afford
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
it less than a year later I started
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
Public School a year early by standard
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
rogay I came home that first day of
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
elementary school and almost every day
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
thereafter asking why do I have to go to
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
school they don't teach me anything
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
there and while a few teachers were
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
Sterling exceptions and went above and
 
04:17:35.109 --> 04:17:35.119 align:start position:0%
beyond that pattern otherwise kept up
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
until I graduated another year early
 
04:17:40.030 --> 04:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
because I wanted out I was miserable
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
because the school did
 
04:17:44.189 --> 04:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
not address my
 
04:17:46.830 --> 04:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
needs and it's easy to look at my track
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
record of success since then and say
 
04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
well he had public school he turned out
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
fine and that's technically true but it
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
hides something important it hides the
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
potential that was lost I look back to
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
my middle school years where I had my
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
nose in a novel instead of a textbook my
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
years in high school where I acted out
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
in boredom and frustration and my years
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
in elementary school where I didn't
 
04:18:11.229 --> 04:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
understand why I was even there what
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
could I have been had I been able to
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
learn to my potential rather than a
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
syllabus that potential that let me
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
finish my Master's Degree before the age
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
of 20 and teach myself enough on my own
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
to pass 13 AP exams to be State AP
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
scholar where could I have gone if I had
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
started using that potential at age five
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
or 10 instead of 15 and more saliently
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
how do you teach the virtues of hard
 
04:18:36.189 --> 04:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
work to a child who doesn't even need to
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
work to achieve good results let
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
children have access to the best fitting
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
education they can no matter their means
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
Public School may be available for
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%

mom my daughter is 17 and currently
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
attends 11th grade at high mowing School
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
in Wilton she attended um manano Walder
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
School here in Kean from 1 to eth grade
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the exception from homeschooling in
 
04:19:51.070 --> 04:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
second grade none of that would have
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
been possible without the children's
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund mananc Walder school
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
will now be closing at the end of this
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
school year 2021 due to covid pushing it
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
edge as well as it being a huge gap
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
between local pay and the cost of
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
private education here in Kean if I had
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
had hb20 available to me I wouldn't have
 
04:20:11.550 --> 04:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
had to pay out of pocket for my
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
daughter's math tutoring and
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
transportation to her school I currently
 
04:20:18.109 --> 04:20:18.119 align:start position:0%
have to pay $160 a month for her to take
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
a bus from Keane to Wilton hb20 would be
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
helpful for transportation purposes
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
which I have found nobody's really
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
mentioning the people that I have heard
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
that are opposed to hb20 like the lady
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
that just spoke always make it about the
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
money not about what is best for our
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
children my child has no learning
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities but I do believe in wal dff
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
education and they meet the child where
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
they're at also please take in mind the
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
lockdowns the lockdowns have been very
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
challenging I'm try not to
 
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
cry for our
 
04:20:51.080 --> 04:20:52.710 align:start position:0%
cry for our
children

04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
suicide and depression
 
04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
depression is at an all-time
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
high it's more important ever than ever

square fitting into a circle in my

for listening to my
 
04:23:21.189 --> 04:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um I would like to stress that
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
this is my testimony but it is also
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh testimony with the endorsement of the
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh Kart Regional School District and
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
School Board the board on uh February
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
4th has unanimous ly voted to oppose
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
this bill due to lack of accountability
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
negative impact on taxpayers in the
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
seven district towns and the lack of
 
04:23:48.269 --> 04:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
transparency to the public I know much
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
has been said before I will try to stick
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
to my two-minute limit so I have
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
provided written testimony but I just
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
will focus on a couple of issues here
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
the bill takes public funds that were
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
generated by Collective Taxation and for
 
04:24:05.109 --> 04:24:05.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of serving a good a common
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
good and end verus the creation of
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
individual entitlements for anybody who
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
wants to spend Community funds on the
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
pursuit of their personal preferences in
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
no other area of Public Funding is such
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
individual spending Authority granted by
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
the state we build roads we build
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%

04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
by local County and state taxes nobody
 
04:24:39.790 --> 04:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
in their right mind would endorse giving
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
State funds to individuals who prefer to
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
hire their own security detail because
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
they don't like the local police force
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
we don't distribute individual portions
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
of our court systems budget just because
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
some people don't like the rulings of
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges and instead want
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
to go out and find themselves their own
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
judge and jury no reasonable Society
 
04:25:03.269 --> 04:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
could successfully exist in this manner
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
and yet House Bill 20 does exactly that
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
its purpose is to replace the New
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public education system which
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
was funded by and for the communities
 
04:25:16.349 --> 04:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
accountable to public elected boards and
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%

oh thank you so much for um having me
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
speak today I have a child who's an
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
accelerated learner when he went to
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten he was beyond board we were
 
04:26:32.950 --> 04:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
both told he was not allowed to say
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
please challenge me um at the end of
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
kindergarten he was hit by a car and
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
acquired a traumatic brain injury with a
 
04:26:44.030 --> 04:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
lot of neurological issues um the school
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
at the time would only give him a 504
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
plan which they did not follow I
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
advocated for one whole year for my son
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
to get the breaks that he needed books
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
on tape because he was unable to see
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
properly um to get rests that he needed
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
um everything I tried failed one whole
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
year I could not find an attorney in the
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
h should have helped me because the
 
04:27:11.910 --> 04:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
schools retain them um I had no choice
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
but to pull my child out of public
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
school at the end of first
 
04:27:19.710 --> 04:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
grade I was horrified at the treatment
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
that my child received from the adults
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
in his school from his
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
teachers I was horrified at the backlash
 
04:27:28.030 --> 04:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
I received as a parent for bringing it
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
to their attention that not only did
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
they not educate him to his abilities
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
they failed him and his
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
they failed him and his
disabilities

04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
what would you have me do for my child
 
04:27:40.750 --> 04:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
for his entire education
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
program continue him on that path or
 
04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
give him the opportunity to flourish in
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
an environment that meets his needs and
 
04:27:52.510 --> 04:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's where he's at right now he's
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
being homeschooled he has a tutor one
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
needed he has um a co-op he goes to and
 
04:28:01.149 --> 04:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to do this with the
 
04:28:02.670 --> 04:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
children's Scholarship
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation um I think hp20 would be the
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
best route for my child situation to go
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
because he would get the physical help
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
he needed he would get the educational
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
help he needed to thrive um I just want
 
04:28:18.750 --> 04:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
to say thank you so much for listening
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
to me and please vote for
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
hb20 um this is about the children this
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
isn't about the teachers it's not about
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
the unions it's not about anything other

04:30:10.349 --> 04:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
won't uh go through all of it I would
 
04:30:12.109 --> 04:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
just want to hit upon some of the
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
bullets uh that are in my testimony the
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
first one uh speaks to the uh lack of
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
accountability in regards to
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
hb20 um as many of you know um idea uh
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
requires school districts to uh be
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
accountable to some really important
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
issues things such as child fine
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
specific disciplinary practices is
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
reporting of restraint
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
seclusion uh expulsions there are very
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
specific requirements in regards to the
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
professionals who can provide services
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to their
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
qualifications um hb20 um none of these
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
procedural types of requirements are
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
spoken to um which really denies the
 
04:31:00.790 --> 04:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
civil rights of of our students with
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities in regards to the fiscal
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
impact you've heard a lot about that
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
um with covid our school districts have
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
been severely impacted physically um
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to special
 
04:31:17.070 --> 04:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
education and students with disabilities
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
our association really feels as though
 
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
subsidizing our private schools with
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
public monies takes away from the much
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
needed fiscal uh monies that are needed
 
04:31:31.469 --> 04:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
for our Public Schools I mentioned uh in
 
04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
which allows for students um who are
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
placed in private or home schools to
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
simultaneously be able to attend uh a
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
public school for curricular and
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities HB uh 20 shift
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
really strips the District of adequacy
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
AIDS and if a student uh with
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I see my time is up so
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%

and I am the executive director for the
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of School
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
principles I've also um already
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony um which
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
included uh testimonials from close to
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
70 School leaders in all five regions of
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
the state so I hope you have an
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at that um again in
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
difference to time and respect to
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee I I realize there have been
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
many Salient points already raised as to
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
the question question questionable
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
composition of the bill as it currently
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
um reads uh including ambiguous
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
definitions therein as already um
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
Christina Barrett from the Schoolboard
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
Association has raised um our concern is
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
as proposed this bill is more of a
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
limitation Act versus a freedom of
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
Education Act um basically ensuring
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
freedom for some but segregation for
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
most um and I think these points have
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
already been made by those who have
 
04:34:06.910 --> 04:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to this piece of
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I I also want to note that
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um Barrett Christina and his testimony
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
referen the code of conduct and the
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
hopes that those in the private sector
 
04:34:17.629 --> 04:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
would be held to that same code of
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
conduct I would like you to also please
 
04:34:23.551 --> 04:34:23.561 align:start position:0%
factor in the code of ethics and taking
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
a look at that in Ju opposition to this
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation as it defines an
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
Educators responsibility to ensure that
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
they are respectful of an inclusion of
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
um all students regarding um Equitable
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
Services uh diverse meeting diverse
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
needs and working with all stakeholders
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
within um any school Community uh uh
 
04:34:51.789 --> 04:34:51.799 align:start position:0%
much of that seems to be void of this
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
specific legislation as it stands um and
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
lastly um many points have been raised
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
about comparing the public sector to um
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
business and industry and yes as leaders
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
we are mindful um that there is place
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
for uh growth which we continue to do um
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
but there is research out there um in
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
Forbes Magazine Pew pole research Gallop
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
holes that educators are in your top
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%

fiscal transparency and accountability
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
which I believe are lacking in this
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
bill on page five lines 35 through 37
 
04:36:50.590 --> 04:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
they deal with Audits and unfortunately
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
the bills Tex provides little clarity
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
about financial audits of this taxpayer
 
04:36:54.959 --> 04:36:56.109 align:start position:0%
about financial audits of this taxpayer
funded

04:36:56.109 --> 04:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
program there is no mandated requirement
 
04:37:01.470 --> 04:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
to conduct an independent Financial
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
audit nor does this bill mandate the
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of efas or scholarship
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that must be audited
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
annually to ensure that tax dollars are
 
04:37:13.629 --> 04:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
spent with the utmost
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
Fidelity secondly I respectfully raise
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with how taxpayer funds are
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
accounted for uh with Public Schools the
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education requires that uh
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
business administrators like myself
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
complete very lengthy Financial reports
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
each year they're called the doe 25 they
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
take days to complete these annual forms
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
allow the state to calculate the cost
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
per pupil um expenses and they also
 
04:37:42.189 --> 04:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
discern how the public schools spend
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
their budgeted dollars data from these
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
mandated Financial forms allows the doe
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
to perform fiscal analysis such as the
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
one created for this bill however based
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the text of this bill we're basically
 
04:37:57.789 --> 04:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
saying that public schools will be held
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
to a much higher standard to account for
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of taxpayer funds and to
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
me that makes no sense
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
I hope that you as elected officials
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
would share in my concern that all
 
04:38:12.429 --> 04:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
entities receiving taxpayer funded
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
dollars would be held to the same
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
standard of financial reporting if the
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is to promote better
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities for New Hampshire students
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
than having the ability to fairly and
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
factually compare the financials of both
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
public and private schools that receive
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars ensures both
 
04:38:34.590 --> 04:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency so again
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to you just consider
 
04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
the financial auditing and
 
04:38:41.470 --> 04:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
accountability safeguards to protect
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars thank you thank you
 
04:38:47.070 --> 04:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr brose uh are
 
04:38:49.750 --> 04:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
there any questions for Mr
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
Bros Mr bro I have one um in working
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education I find
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
that some departments or some school
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
districts are having their doe 25 forms
 
04:39:04.150 --> 04:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
audited prior to sending it over to doe
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
does your District audit the 25 or
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
simply audit the entire District which
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
you are required to do for your assets
 
04:39:12.510 --> 04:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures that is an excellent
 
04:39:16.750 --> 04:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
question uh both districts which I work
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
for we have we use audited results
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
meaning that our independent Financial
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
audit which is done are used to then
 
04:39:28.709 --> 04:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
produce the doe 25 reports so it ensures
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
that uh a second set of eyes have have
 
04:39:33.789 --> 04:39:33.799 align:start position:0%
looked at the financials which again
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
going back to my public to my comment I
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
just believe that if you're going to
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
pass a bill like this then uh then you
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
should have those same standards of
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency because
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
when you do compare District to District
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
or school to school um you should be
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
able to compare apples to apples and
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
when I say that these doe 25 forms they
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
drill down to how much money you spend
 
04:40:01.230 --> 04:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
on electricity to books to computers you
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
name it and it would be really nice to
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
know that when you're spending taxpayer
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
dollars that you know um and you heard
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
the testimony of of kids who are in
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill who they want a
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
computer well it would be good to know
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
where the money was spent and again
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's an administrative cost that
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
public schools have to account for um
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately in this bill it
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that that level of
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
financial accountability and
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
transparency is there and and I'm asking
 
04:40:31.470 --> 04:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
you to reconsider that thank you very
 
04:40:34.670 --> 04:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
much superintendent thank you thank you
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh last speaker is Liz Canada
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh Liz you've been promoted welcome to
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%

04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and hello members of the House
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
Education committee for the record my
 
04:40:55.628 --> 04:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
name is Liz Canada I'm a stepparent with
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
children in the exitor district and I'm
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
here speaking on behalf of myself I'm
 
04:41:02.030 --> 04:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
here to express my opposition to House
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 and my testimony today will
 
04:41:06.430 --> 04:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
focus on oversight and
 
04:41:08.670 --> 04:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
accountability thankfully I think we can
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
find Common Ground yesterday morning
 
04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
there was a tweet from the New Hampshire
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
GOP about a charter school that had
 
04:41:18.430 --> 04:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
quote grossly misused federal funds
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
unquote one of the major concerns about
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
privatization as the GOP pointed out in
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
this tweet is the lack of oversight and
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
accountability issues surrounding that
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
specific Charter School have been
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
present for almost two years but because
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
of the lack of oversight and
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
accountability these issues seem
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
seemingly continued hb20 also lacks
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
oversight and accountability measures I
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
am curious how the representatives on
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
this committee will work to resolve this
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant concern especially given the
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
Republican party's recognition that
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
misuse of public dollars and
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
privatization efforts is already very
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
present in our state thank you for this
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%

the rest of the document well what we
 
04:42:20.190 --> 04:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
need to do is we need to ask those that
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
are in the queue or in the attendee list
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that desires to
 
04:42:29.550 --> 04:42:29.560 align:start position:0%

04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
before trying to get on but they had the
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
wrong number and so I don't know if they
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
now have the right number I tried to let
 
04:42:39.550 --> 04:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
them know they they kept getting on and
 
04:42:43.390 --> 04:42:43.400 align:start position:0%

04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
Asma hello can you hear me now yes hi uh
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
my name is Asma aluni and I am a mother
 
04:45:44.270 --> 04:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
of eight children who are now adults um
 
04:45:48.270 --> 04:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
I have homeschooled two uh of my sisters
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so I understand the need um to make
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
sure that people do have a right to
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
homeschool their children but I'm
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
actually um speaking today in great
 
04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill because um
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our public schools are
 
04:46:06.990 --> 04:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
underfunded and that is a big issue and
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to be focused on
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
and so I just um want to speak in as a a
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
mother who is someone who's homeschooled
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and at the same time um I think this is
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
a mistake um when we should be focusing
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
our money on on our public schools that
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
