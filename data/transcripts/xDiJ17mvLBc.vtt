28th 2025 first up is House Bill
 
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
322 allowing a parent paying child
 
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
support to retain the exclusive right to
 
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
claim the child as a dependent on it
 
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
should be his or her tax return and the
 
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
speaker calls up representative Barton
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
not yet there we go thank you Mr
 
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:45.790 align:start position:0%
not yet there we go thank you Mr
chairman

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
welcome you may begin thank you um so I
 
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
I submitted this piece of legislation um
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
some of you may or may not know that in
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
2018 since
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
2018 uh child support payments are no
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
longer um tax deductible so you can't
 
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
claim child support on your as as a tax
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
exemption you still have to pay taxes on
 
00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
all the child support you would pay to
 
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
the other spouse from one spouse to
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
another um and it doesn't count as
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
income for the person receiving so they
 
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
it's Tech technically it's support for
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
the child but um it's uh it doesn't
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
count as as income and
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh it it seems an unjustice since 2018
 
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
since the payer can't take the exemption
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
they ought to at least take the child
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
tax credit as they're the primary
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
Financial um uh supporter uh of the
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
child uh so they should have uh the
 
00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
exclusive right to claim the child if
 
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
they are providing financial support
 
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.069 align:start position:0%
they are providing financial support
exclusively

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 align:start position:0%
uh that's all I had to say on this on
 
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
this um this bill I'm happy to take any
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions or provide any
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
rebuttal questions representative Greg
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
being here representative and for taking
 
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
my question so my question is we do know
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
within child support that sometimes
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
people are paying child support and it
 
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
might even be like $50 a month so they
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
are not the prime like um supporter
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
Financial supporter of the child so in
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
that case why would they be able to um
 
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
claim them on their taxes if the other
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
person is providing more I'm I'm I'm not
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
sure how you could say that they're not
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
the the the prime supporter even if they
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
were paying $1 that would be $1 from one
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
spouse to the other why isn't the other
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
spouse paying anything they're they're
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
the primary supporter because they are
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're paying to the other spouse
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
either they have they're making more
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
money the court determined that that
 
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
they make more more money I think what
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
would happen as a result of the passage
 
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is if there was uh
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
if it was determined that there the
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
disparity or that the $2,000 tax credit
 
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
would um essentially be a wash or that
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
it would be a benefit to one party to
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
the other they should just not have
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
child support and and uh there would be
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
no child support payment and they could
 
00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 align:start position:0%
alternate tax years for um for the
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
exemption which would be much more
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
valuable to either spouse so the $50
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
argument I think is pretty pretty moot
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Greg for the followup um
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your opinion on that it's
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
my question is though how how much does
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
it take to provide for a child like if
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
somebody's supplying $50 a month how
 
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
much do you think it actually takes to
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
provide for the child and where the rest
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
of that money coming from uh thank you
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that question so in the state of New
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I guess um some children are
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
more valuable than others uh based on on
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
child child support payment it's all
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
about the the income of the parents of
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
the child that's how it's how it's
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
decided so if the parents are providing
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
equal financial support to the child it
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
would be it would be essentially a wash
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
but if you reach if essentially if one
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
one parent is paying
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
$166 67 cents per month that would
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
equate to $2,000 a year so maybe that's
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
the threshold that would the parties get
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
together and say it's a wash we might as
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
well just alternate the tax credit
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
instead of um one person having to pay
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
taxes on top of that $166 a month
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
whatever that minimum is because they're
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
punished by having to pay the taxes on
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
top of it it's free money for the person
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
that's receiving it so why wouldn't they
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
exemption representative Raymond thank
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
you I want to follow up on what you just
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
said about um paying taxes on it because
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
I'm confused how one pays taxes on child
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
support uh yeah I'm happy to explain
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
that so how you pay taxes is in order to
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
pay money to the other party you have to
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
first earn it and when you earn that
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
money you pay income taxes to the
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
federal government on that money that
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
you earn so you pay the taxes first and
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
then you give the taxfree money to the
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
recipient that's how do you know what
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire followup
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
apologize that's okay um do you know
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
what the New Hampshire fiscal policy uh
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
Institute has estimated the annual costs
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
are for things like child care or rent
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I don't and I think it's I
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
think it's completely irrelevant to this
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
to this case it's all about uh if if one
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
parent is paying money to another they
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
have to pay taxes on it they should they
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
can't get a tax exemption anymore so
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
they ought to be able to claim
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
the child as a dependent uh on their on
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
their tax form like they could before
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
2018 representative any for further just
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
just one one last one would it surprise
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
you to know that the average cost of
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
child care is almost $20,000 a year in
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the average cost of a
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment is $1900 a
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
month I uh no it wouldn't thank you
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corson
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
being here to answer our questions um in
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
regards to the if if one party pays the
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
other spouse a dollar um doesn't the
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
custodial parent pay for that child and
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
everything that that the other spouse is
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
not paying for I mean if you have a a
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
husband who's paying a dollar in child
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
support wouldn't the parent that is
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of the rent and the bills
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
and everything else be paying a lot more
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
dollar I I think that would be
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
determined um by the court I mean the
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
court would determine um you know who
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
has to pay what but I if they're not
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
each each parent and and I I believe
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're a 5050 state or at least we
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
promote that um but each parent would uh
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
provide essentially equal care for that
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
child they have a they have an equal
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
burden and um whether it's the father or
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the mother who's the primary fin
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
Financial uh provider they still have to
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
pay taxes to whatever and whatever
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're owed or whatever is
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
ordered and um whether whether they have
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
primary custody or second or or you know
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
a lower Arrangement it shouldn't matter
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
because they're the P primary Financial
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh and it's $2,000 that we're talking
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
about it's not
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
$20,000 it's not $30,000 the burden that
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
burden is shared it's it's the taxes
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
that are paid on the child support that
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
that since 2018 there's an imbalance on
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so you know if if the if the amount
 
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.949 align:start position:0%
and so you know if if the if the amount
was

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
$166 a month it would be a wash I can
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
tell you it's probably 10 times that for
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
for a lot of cases so $2,000 is very
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
small than a tax exempt you would have
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
received before 2018 so a lot of the
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
arguments here are move follow up um
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you the the custodial parent is
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
going to be putting in the rest of that
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
amount to raise that child the
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
regardless of the Court the Court's
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
decision of whether somebody has to pay
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
$50 the custodial parent then is paying
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more so to automatically
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
give the first spouse the tax exemption
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
just seems
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
wrong I is that is there a question make
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
sure it's a question sorry sorry um that
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
was a question okay next time would you
 
00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.629 align:start position:0%
was a question okay next time would you
believe

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um so to comment on that um if
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying one one uh one parent pays
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
more than the other they should be they
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
should be providing equal support from
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
the family from the um family courts I
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how you can say one parent is
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
paying more than than the other just you
 
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
know sporadically like like that um in
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
in many cases um there is an inequality
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
and but but the court should say you
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
have this burden and you have this
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
burden and it ought to be balanced
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
fairly whether it's the time with the
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
child um the the amount of care that's
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
given from from one custodial parent to
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
the other um but at the end of the day
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to finances it used to be
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
the person paying the child support
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
could declare it as an exemption and
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
probably thousands and thousands of
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
dollars declare it as an exemption and
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
they would alternate years or they would
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
come up to some arrangement with
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
declaring the um the child as a tax
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
credit which is is really small dollars
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
maximum $2,000 for for a kid so it seems
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
only reasonable once you pass a certain
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
threshold of of child support that um
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
that the the the financial provider
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to you know at least
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
recuperate some of the free some of the
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
money that he's he's already paid taxes
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
on or her has already paid taxes on
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
anyone who hasn't asked a question
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
yet representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh no actually I mean M I'm so
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
you got it you got a promotion I promot
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
sorry about I'm sorry about that thank
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um my husband
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
pay child support for a very long time
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
and um and his ended well before 2018
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
but um just for my curiosity and
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
reference can you is like do you know
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
like what um how do I find out about
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
researching like that because I don't
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
recall us ever taking a deduction on our
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
taxes when we were filed
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh married and filing
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
together it it should have been in the
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
um uh in the decree and part of the um
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh either the parenting plan so one
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
one of the three do or no it's the
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
universal support order it would be in
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
the Universal support order um who gets
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
to claim the child on what
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
year um followup please follow up
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
followup yes um so so that's I'm
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
confused I'm sorry I'm just trying to
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
sort through this I'm confused because
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
um taking a tax credit versus taking a
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
deduction for the amount of money that
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
you paid in child support are different
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
so is I'm not I'm confused about what
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
actually uh is there a question yes
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
could you could you please um clarify um
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about a tax
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
credit or a deduction for the total
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
amount that you pay in child support per
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
year yes so tax deductions as I said
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
before do not exist anymore since 2018
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
so there's no such thing as as a tax
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
deduction for for um a a child for for
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
child support you can only um you can
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
only get a child tax credit that's it
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
you sorry representative Raymond I'm
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
sorry representative George has had her
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
hand up as well she has I didn't see
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
George thank you um Mr
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just want to know because
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
I know there is a lot um parents
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
sometime the woman that like the one who
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
in custody take care of the kids okay
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know how much for someone who
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
take care of can be two child three
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
child yourself do you know how much that
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
person is making for take care of all
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
those kids if the one pay charge support
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
just give like
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
$40 or $50 a month how much that the
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
person who I take care of the kids you
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
know how much is cost for
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
her um well I mean if if I as a man was
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking care of uh my child and I was
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
receiving uh child support you're you're
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
asking um how much my taking care of my
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
child is is worth then the
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
$50 yeah because when you take care of
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
the the the kids uh I'm sure the courts
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
would determine that based on the
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
financial avidid of the two parties and
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not the same for every person
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier uh children in our
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
state have different value some children
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
are worth more than others uh yeah I
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
know it's it's crazy but um the
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise there would be Universal child
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
support and it would be this child is
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
worth $20,000 a year and and that's it
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
so if you have one parent that makes $2
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
million their duty of support at least
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing from the
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee would be not based on the
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
income of the parents in their financial
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
affidavit but that that base support
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
that monetary support of uh $220,000 I
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
guess is what I heard why isn't it based
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
on that it's it's not it's based on the
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh the income of of the parents the and
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
and the disparity of income between the
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
parents is how it's calculated and uh
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
now I'm not here to debate how how a uh
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
family court judge determines um how
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
much is owed in support by looking at
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
the burden on one party um who's taking
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
care of a child I would say in cases
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
where there's 50/50 which is a majority
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
of cases both parents would share that
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
burden equally so why does it matter I I
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
don't know but I'm simply here to say
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
the person that's that's um the primary
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
financial support provider should at the
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
very minimum because they're paying
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
taxes on the money to the recipient who
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
is not paying taxes on the money that's
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
being received ought to at least claim
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
the small tiny
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
benefit of of the child tax credit which
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
I see one hand up representative
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
Malone thank you so can we go back to
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
definitions because you are saying
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that pays child support versus
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
Main Financial provider so someone can
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
pay child support and not be the Main
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
Financial provider so that's where I'm
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
getting confused because I felt like
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's what family court would do
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
whoever pays the most they would get to
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
claim that child that's how I've seen it
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the past but just because you pay
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
child support and I think maybe this is
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
clearing up does not mean that you are
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
the Main Financial supporter of that
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
child so is it just because you pay
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
child support or is it because you pay
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
more than 50% of that child's
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
income uh I would think that if you
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
weren't the primary Financial uh uh
 
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
provider you wouldn't be paying any
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
child support in fact I I you know I
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't understand the specific
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
scenario that you're you're talking
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
about but if if a court um orders uh you
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
know it should be equal between the
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
parties based on you know based on um
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the the order is even if it's
 
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
whatever the the order is even if it's
not

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
5050 um you know one one party paying
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
the other the other party has still has
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes on on that money and the
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
recipient doesn't have to pay taxes so I
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
mean if if I was able to change the
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
legislation and make it so that you had
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
to pay the recipient had to pay the the
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
taxes on on the child support you know
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
something different but it the Dynamics
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
of of the law doesn't work that way so
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
this this is um all this to do is
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
correct what was changed in 2018 in
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
2018 the IRS was tired of of chasing uh
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
deadbeat parents uh who were claiming
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
the exemption but weren't actually
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
paying the child support so uh that's
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's why the the IRS changed its
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
statutes it it penalized um everybody
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
that pays child support cuz they can't
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
claim the exemption anymore because
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of dead parents out
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
there and and it's not fair so this
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
seeks to at least remedy that since we
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
seem to be asking now the same questions
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the representative for
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
presenting his bill because I have
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
another pink card before me okay and I'm
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
happy to stick around for everybody also
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%

and Mr chairman I did distribute the
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Malone and that's where
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
it's going we do not have it
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
yet but we soon will have it yet
 
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
terrific got stuck the chair recognizes
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman for passing
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
things to her left it was
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
a it was just red light oh did she think
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
the red light meant stop it did that's
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
what I thought
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
you so I can I'll begin while people are
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
passing if that's okay all right just
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
move it along yeah um so U my name is
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
Mary Krueger I am an attorney with New
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance um we are a
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit Law Firm um we um
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
represent low-income and aging clients
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire in civil legal
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
cases so we um do what's commonly known
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
as legal aid or Poverty Law um and we're
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
very concerned we are opposed to this
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
the passage of um HB 322 especially um
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
for the lowincome population this could
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
really um cause issues for people um
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
often the uh people that we represent in
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
cases we exclusively do um domestic
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
violence cases and we represent um
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors in high lethality
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases um but often
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
both of the parties are living at or
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
below the poverty level um and so courts
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
right now can adjust um accordingly
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
who gets to um how the parties share who
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
gets to claim children as tax dependence
 
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.669 align:start position:0%
gets to claim children as tax dependence
and

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
um I understand under this particular
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
Bill if the parties agree to do it a
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
certain way they can still do that um we
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
often have cases where parties they may
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually agree on that but they don't
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
agree maybe on a lot of other things so
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
they may be both um proposing to the
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
court that they share um you know often
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
splitting children in a particular way
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be fair um in different tax years um
 
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
but the court is making that decision
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
and making that order um if it is in
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
dispute the court um would not have the
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
ability to fairly determine especially
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
in cases where you have a like a $50 a
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
month child support uh order which you
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
know can be common it can often be a
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
fair low amount um and so this is a way
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
to sort of compensate um for parents to
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
be able to afford basic needs for their
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
children and so having this be a
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory um requirement would really
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
remove the ability for courts to fairly
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
allocate the resources which are often
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
Limited in the cases that we handle um
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
and so we are asking this committee to
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
vote no um to the passage of this Bill
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor any questions
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here um
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
I'm actually really glad that you're
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
here because my question is about court
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
and judges so I'm a child of divorce as
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
many people in my generation are and my
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
parents Switched Off year to year on who
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
get to got to claim myself and my
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
sisters are Judges doing that now like
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
making orders saying you get it this
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
year you get it that year are they able
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
to split up kids where maybe someone has
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
this child more and another child less
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
because of the child's needs do judges
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
currently make distinctions like that
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes all the time okay um it's very
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
common for judges to do that and then
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
they'll account for like if there's
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
three children you know they'll account
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
for kind of switching the one the third
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
child around and then they account for
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
what happens when they um are no longer
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
longer um you know the age out of being
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
a tax dependent depending on when that
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
happens they'll they'll write that into
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
the decree followup followup yes um if a
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
family situation changes so say um one
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
person has been paying child support but
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
he has a a he or she has a financial
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
change in their life like they've lost
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
their job or whatever do judges can
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%

every three years by law or when there's
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
a substantial change in
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
circumstance um and they would be able
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
to request a change to who claims tax
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
dependence within that request to change
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%

hearing on House Bill
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
322 what do you
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
think I open the executive session now
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the chair calls on
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:47.950 align:start position:0%
 
motion

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman I would like
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
to make the motion of itl on House Bill
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
322 and looking for a second
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you any
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
discussion among the committee
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone thank you Mr
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
chairman as a co-sponsor to this bill I
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the bill because I thought
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
it might bring some relevance to the uh
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
to increasing the child support rsas
 
00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
that would better what we currently have
 
00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:28.750 align:start position:0%
that would better what we currently have
um

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
I I thought it would strengthen our
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
child support in some way manner or form
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
by listening to the testimony of the
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor however in my opinion this bill
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
not only does not accomplish that but it
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
in fact decreases the value of our
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
current system and for that reason I
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
have to support the itl motion uh
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
100% other members of the committee wish
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
to speak speak on
 
00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.029 align:start position:0%
to speak speak on
this

00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:03.549 align:start position:0%
this
representative

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
Le not pronouncing all the letters yes
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so I have many family members that
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
have stayed together gone um through
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
divorce and everything and um some of
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
them actually they would switch every
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
other year when who would file the kid
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
and when and each situation was
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
different and I think that the court
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
system and the parents can decide what's
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
best for their situation and um what's
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
best for them based on like financially
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
and who's more the stable parent who's
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
not and determin it that way that the
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
courts have been doing in the past and I
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
think that that has been working so far
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue I think that the
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
courts would come to us and tell us this
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
isn't working like they've had before in
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
situations thank you for your testimony
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative love
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
um our child support laws certainly need
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
work I think the judicial discretion uh
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
parts of our laws are way too strong but
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't it I'll be supporting
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
the itl thank
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
georgees have to look thank you Mr
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um my testimony is uh like I'm
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
here as a cultural person too to show
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
like there is a some parent who are not
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
sometime they are here sometime they go
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
back to their country or what but they
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
don't they're going to say they don't
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
working you know or they they come here
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
they work just a little bit but where
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
they go over there they work they do lot
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
of work they do they make money but they
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
don't give it to the kids they don't
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
give it to the wife and I think so if uh
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
we support this that um to say like a
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
give them for the independent I think so
 
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
that to give give it there again more
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
money and I think so we don't that is my

a marriage contract after the contract
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
has been completely dissolved it's
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
basically a court saying the the
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
contract between these two parties
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
specifically in ironable differences

contract be between the parties
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
had a duty to the other spouse and vice
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
versa uh that that contract is null and
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
void but no you still have to keep uh
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
you this provision we're it's going to
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
survive the dissolution of that marriage
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
contract I'm going to make you uh um
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%

work and pay money even though you don't
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
know what duty of support to the other
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
spouse anymore because the marriage is
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
is dissolved so that's essentially what
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
what alimony is and um it ought to be uh
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
dissolved when the parties seek to have
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
the agreement that they made dissolved
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
um this again this is limited to no faal
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
divorces and irreconcilable differences
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
it's not um it's not restricted as um in
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
other in in four fault cases as a remedy
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
uh to make one spouse whole o over the
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
other I don't want don't want to go down
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
that road at all I think I think in
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
those cases um uh there should be
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
discretion um but in cases where the
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
marriage contract is dissolved by by
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
both parties there's absolutely no way
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
that one party should continue a marital
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to the other can you can you
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
imagine if and and if if you if you
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't have marital relations its grounds
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
for its grounds for divorce in our state
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
but can you imagine a judge or ordering
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
post divorce decree one party to provide
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
marital relations to the other party
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's absurd why should any provision of
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
a marital contract survive the
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
dissolution of that contract and why
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
would that not constitute involuntary uh
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
servitude um as described in the 13th
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'll take your
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
questions any question questions for the
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative rice thank
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
that if a spouse supported one spouse
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
all the way through Medical School
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
through getting their license
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a successful
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
practice at the expense of them getting
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
a degree somewhere staying home raising
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
the children
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
Etc do you not believe they are owed for
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices they themselves have
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
made I I believe that the agreements
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are made between um I wouldn't want
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
to get into the agreements between a
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
party um you know if that's not part of
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
a marriage contract or or you know if a
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
spouse wants to voluntarily provide
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
something to another spouse you know
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
that that would be like a division of
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
assets thing or or you would look at the
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
debt I guess as far as as far as that
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
division there's no duty of support from
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
one spouse to another when the contract
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
is dissolved regardless of who who put
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
who through medical
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
school would you believe that that's one
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
of the main purposes of
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
alimony uh again no I wouldn't believe
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
irrelevant seeing no further questions
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and uh I'm
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
searching for a pink card that would
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
accompany a
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
handout do you pass a pink card
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
the papers it did did you have the pink
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
card oh I might have it here here we

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
Cries we're all going to take turns
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
being the roadblock so no one's feeling
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
R light is on
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Greg is to remind me of
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
insult I won't take it that
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
way um thank you Mr chairman um and
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
name is Mary Krueger I'm an attorney
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Legal Assistant we
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
are a Statewide nonprofit Law Firm um
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
and we represent low-income clients and
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
um aging clients in civil legal cases
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire we also operate our
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
domestic violence advocacy project where
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
we represent um victims and survivors in
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
Family Court getting protection orders
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
and in divorce and parenting cases uh we
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 325 and ask the committee um
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
to also um vote inexpedient to
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislate um there are three main
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that we believe this
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
would harm domestic violence survivors
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
especially um because Financial abuse
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
and control is um present in as many as
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
99% of domestic violence
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
relationships um I did attach to uh my
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
handouts um a fact sheet about financial
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
abuse which is something that's often
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
overlooked um when we think about
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse we often think about the
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
physical violence which is also um you
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
know ex can be extreme and concerning um
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
but the the financial abuse can often
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
keep a victim in a relationship um
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't see a way to be able
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
to afford to live especially when
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
there's children involved um and the
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
second reason is we believe that this
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
could increase the level of adversarial
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
divorces in New
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and then our third reason
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that this will harm um especially
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
older spouses um who've sacrificed
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
careers um in order to stay home and
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
care for the family um and that that's
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
an agreement that often people will
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
reach and if they get divorced later in
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
life um they may not have been out
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
earning income paid income they've done
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of work um that's worth something
 
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
and um that's the reason why we have
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
alimony um and we worked really hard in
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
this committee I guess it was about 2018
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
to revise and update the alimony law in
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
order to have more predictability in the
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
way that courts can um
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
determine uh not only whether alimony
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
should be paid or um but also how much
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
and for how long um so that it's going
 
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
to reduce the level of
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
adversarial um proceedings in our court
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
system so that people are more likely to
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
come to the table and make
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
agreements um what this would do is not
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
only make it harder for domestic
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
violence survivors to leave knowing that
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
the financial control can continue and
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
if they um seek a divorce or the other
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
party seeks a divorce based on
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences or no fault
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're not entitled to request alimony
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
if this law would be passed so they
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
would have to plead fault grounds they
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
may have a basis for that but fault
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
grounds are extremely grueling to
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
prove um and it costs a lot of money um
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to be helping Finance
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys with this bill because people
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
will have to if they need alimony figure
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
out how to bring their fault case and
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
prove it um and it's a high High bar I
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
can tell you that in the work that we do
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of cases where we
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
have high earners on the other side
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
because we're we're representing
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
low-income people but every now and then
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a very extreme Financial
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
abuse type situation where there's a
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
high ear or on the other side we may not
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
opt to do fault grounds because of the
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
traumatic um situation that this can
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
cause for somebody to have to go through
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
a fault case it's not good for anybody
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
involved to have to prove a fall case um
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
there may be reasons to do that um there
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
may be good reasons to do that um but if
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
you can have the option of no fault and
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
know that you can have the support that
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
you are entitled to because you have put
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
so much effort into um keeping the
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
family um raising the children keeping
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
the home all of the
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
things um that people sacrif I to do for
 
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
their for their own personal reasons and
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
then they have nothing when they get
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
divorced because they haven't been out
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
in the world to earn and that's that is
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the alimony is to to to
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
help have some fairness and the last
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say about that is the alimony
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
law that we have right now the first
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
step is for the court to see does the
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
person seeking alimony have a need for
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
that alimony and the court needs to
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
analyze that um they can look at the
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
earning capacity of that person their
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
education their background all of those
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
things to determine if they have a need
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
if they say yes then they look at the
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
other party's ability to
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
pay and that's after they're meeting you
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
know their reasonable expenses and you
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
sort of look at the lifestyle that the
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
parties have been accustomed to and you
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
know that people reasonably need to
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
adjust that when they're splitting
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
up and then we apply a formula in order
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
to figure out the amount and the
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
duration the duration half the length of
 
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.870 align:start position:0%
duration the duration half the length of
the

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
marriage so you're married for 20 years
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
you get 10 years of alimony if you
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
qualify okay so say you're 40 years old
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
you've stayed home 20 years of ing
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
children you get 10 years of alimony
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
so that's just the practical way that it
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
operates that this legislature and this
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee passed in order to have a fair
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
way to handle this issue so this this
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
would completely dismantle it and that's
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
why we ask you in expedient to legislate
 
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.630 align:start position:0%
why we ask you in expedient to legislate
thank

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
you some of us in this committee were
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
also members of the special committee on
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of circuit court and
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
as such we at least one day and a few of
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
us more than one day shadowed family
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
court and we saw the various things in
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
real time on the ground that take place
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
in these kinds of
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
matters would this bill take away judges
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
discretion in some way by simply saying
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
eliminated well the judges would not be
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
able to order money unless there were
 
00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:30.430 align:start position:0%
able to order money unless there were
fault

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
fault
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
grounds that were proven and so with the
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
fault grounds that's very much in the
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion to determine whether
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are fault grounds I see I've asked
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
my question backwards sorry okay but it
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
experience heighten the number of
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
divorces that are no longer no fault but
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
divorces for cause which in your
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
experience is time effort and money to
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
prove yes thank you it would heighten it
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
if we think back 50 years before we had
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
no fault divorce I mean people had to if
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
they wanted to get divorced figure out
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
who's going to take the hit on fault
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
right and now we've got to prove it so
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
like they might agree to it but um
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're not you know there are there are
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court cases that
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
we have back in the 1800s where people
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get their divorce because they
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't prove fault I mean it is a very
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
high bar which is why we have no fault
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
um so you will have people who need
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
alimony to live trying to figure out how
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
to squeeze their situation into a fault
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
ground and that's that's sort of where
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
we were 50 years ago how do we squeeze
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
the situation into a fault ground so I
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
questions for the counselor
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
question so I'm thinking about a
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situation but this is what
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
happens with actually a lot of people
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
that I know where the marriage has run
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
its course and both parties have agreed
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
that they want to get divorced it's not
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
a high conflict divorce they're they're
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
in agreement they want to get divorced
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
and they on their own have decided that
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
because one spouse is either unemployed
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
from raising kids or underemployed that
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
the other spouse wants to provide
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
alimony would the changes to this bill
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate that possibility because it
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
says that the judge can only order
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
alimony in divorce cases decreed in
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
favor of the innocent party so would
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
that impact these people who have
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
already decided on their own that they
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
that this is the arrangement they want
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
with their spouse that they still like
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to be married to
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm just reading it again so it
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
says the court May order May order term
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
alimony solely this would be the new
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
language solely in divorce cases decreed
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of the innocent party under
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
4587 comma upon agreement of the parties
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I think the parties could
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
and if I could just add I think parties
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
do agree that that definitely happens
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
and I think we were Chang the law in
 
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
order to make it easier for them to
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
predict what alimony would be what the
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
obligation would be it's the cases where
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
people proceed on irreconcilable
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
differences and one party requests
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
alimony and there's not agreement about
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
that and maybe some other things like
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
property Division and other things like
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
that and so the court is having to hear
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
that case and that's the case where then
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to for sure see people now
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
pleading fault probably both
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
directions right I think this this this
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
um committee has Heard lots of testimony
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
from the court about the 10 to 15% of
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
divorce cases that take up all their
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
time yeah so thank you representative
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
Marquel you are an attorney would you
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
care to weigh in on this bill um yes Mr
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I can
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
um we get that on there okay uh I happen
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
to agree with your testimony attorney
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
Krueger and uh fall grounds are
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult to prove as a
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney I can tell you
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's been my experience and uh this
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
would unduly restrict A party's right to
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
be able to to be able to ask and receive
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
alimony um I'm also uh with respectfully
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with your the prior
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
witness's testimony I am unaware that
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court court or
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
any court has ever has ever decreed has
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
ever decided that alimony constitutes a
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
violation of the 13th Amendment to the
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution or the New
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution for that matter
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so I would support this and um
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes time for to execute this
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%

thank you for that tutorial on our names

it makes it easier for us to
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
pronounce um again I I co-sponsored this
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill because I always believe that
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's room to
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
enhance uh a particular RSA when it
 
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
enhance uh a particular RSA when it
comes

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
to helping people through some of the
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
most difficult times in their family
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
life uh it is now uh
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
my to my knowledge that this bill does
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
not in any way manner or form enhance
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
any of the laws that we have I am
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
plagued with the thought that somebody
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
thinks that paying alimony is Tad amount
 
00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:11.390 align:start position:0%
thinks that paying alimony is Tad amount
to

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
slavery I don't know where that thought
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
process came from and I'm not going to
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
question it but what I do question is
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
that when you marry it is a
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
contract in business when you enter into
 
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.510 align:start position:0%
contract in business when you enter into
a

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
contract like with a marriage contract
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
a an uncertain date sometimes as to how
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the length of that contract and a
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
marriage contract is usually an unspoken
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
Lifetime and when that contract is
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
broken sometimes a person needs help
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
getting themselves back on track
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
again that's one of the reasons for
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
alimony in business you buy out the
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
contract I don't think that the other
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
party is being bought out but I think
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
that if you want to relate a contract to
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
a contract that's the only way you could
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
coldly do it without
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
feeling men and women who are in a
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
contract with their
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
partner deserve the opportunity to be
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
educated or have the time
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
to get a job that
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
will help support themselves and their
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
family and that's what alimon is all
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
about therefore I
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
100% um support the itl
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%

just my testimony for
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
myself because for the things
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
um I was divor I I did a lot of
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
work but 20 after 20
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
years I was just um my ex-husband was
 
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.230 align:start position:0%
years I was just um my ex-husband was
asking

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
divorce but what they cot did everything
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
like just they didn't give me anything
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
not the harmony but I was paying I I was
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
not working I was going to school I was
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
paying the I was pay the mortgage I was
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
I was taking of the kids and the only
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
one things I was just getting the social
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
security for the kids but when those
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
kids become 18 it was just when2 one
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
just come 18 after one year and then and
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
another one I stay with but I never get
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
the Almon but I suffer and I see all
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
those women and that man we all the
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
money we was making by the was building
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
the the the house in their country
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
because we are not the same country I
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
come from Africa I come from hi he build
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
a big house there and now stay nowal
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
with another the woman and he was sick
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
he was in a car accident I support

be with those women they need to give
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
them har money because this is is not
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
something think um we can just accept
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
because uh to eliminate uh I'm just with
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%

it's the opposite way too and I just
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clear for the
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%

um I think we ought to be real careful
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh putting laws together and voting on
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
laws that encourage divorce uh you know
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
this uh without this we're we're
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh what happened to me you
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
know I was working 16 hours a day uh I
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
got hurt uh couldn't provide the the
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
financials uh you know the financial uh
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
for the for the home and um you know my
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
my ex-wife came up and said I'm not
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
having fun anymore we're
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
done okay uh where would that leave a
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
guy like me um you know I I I think this
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but I I'm I'm you know I
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't like alimony I think it should be
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
an individual uh
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
agreement you know uh you know in each
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
in each individual divorce um you know
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
if if it if it fits fine and if it
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't but there there's no
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
fault uh no fault divorce is has has
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
been a a a a burden to the to to society
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
in my eyes you know uh and to
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh I think I think this would be a a
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction but uh you
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
know probably needs needs some work
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
needs some work but um you know uh I'll
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
be I'll be voting for The itl but uh i'
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see something with uh
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
something like this that uh we could we
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
could work on and uh and come up with
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
something better than what we have by
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
way of example and a positive shout out
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
representativ Spain has been bringing
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
bills on the same topic three or four
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
times now because we would say close but
 
00:57:44.559 --> 00:57:45.470 align:start position:0%
times now because we would say close but
no

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
cigar which was not a put down it was we
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
can't vote for it just yet and take the
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that we all made and come back
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
and he's come back and I think this time
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
we may one or more of his bills make it
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
so maybe that is the case with this and
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
some other bills um and anything any
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts that you have to any thoughts
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
that any of us have for the prime
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this to possibly make this
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
passible another time I'm sure this
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor would would welcome that
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
um anyone else uh representative Greg
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think one thing
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about certainly when
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
we um were on the special committee on
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
Family Court
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
and within this um I almost said this
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
chamber I don't know what this whatever
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
this room we've had a lot of discussions
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
about the separation between what we do
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively and what the Judiciary
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
does and certainly when we're talking
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
about alimony we're talking about things
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
like this this is a on siiz fits none
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
situation so really leaving that to the
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judge the judge does
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
not always award alimony that's just not
 
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.039 align:start position:0%
100% thing and I think that that's
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
really where that still
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
belongs thank you we're going to take
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
anybody who hasn't testified yet and
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
then you get another shot at it okay
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else who hasn't while
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative georgees is pondering her
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
second fight at the Apple representative
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
marel do you wish to weigh in briefly on
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
this um but well uh I think the bill is
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
an expedient to
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislate um it's difficult to implement
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh as uh attorney uh Mary Krueger
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out and in my experience
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
litigating divorce matters fault grounds
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
are exceedingly difficult to prove they
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
also have in in terms of implementing
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
them it's not only that you pled F
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
grounds there have to be certain other
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
statutory com uh factors that have to
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
play into it as well and for a court to
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
consider it the approximate cause of the
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the marriage this would
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
make it exceedingly difficult and um I
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's going to solve any
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
problems so I would renew my motion for
 
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.549 align:start position:0%
problems so I would renew my motion for
an

01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
itl one more representative
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
George thank you chairman um I just was
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
try to make sure to there is a lot of um
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
people sometime they don't even know
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
much about the law and about all those
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
things for the divorce like when I went
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
to for the divorce I didn't know every
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
anything but to to help
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
people like when I was at this time I
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
think so for today I know a lot of
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
things but at the time I didn't even
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
know what what I supposed to do what I
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
who can help me we are here to help the
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
the community the people like this thank
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
grman thank you chairman Pearson and
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
just to pick you back on what the
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative was
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
saying alimony can be associated with
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
such a dirty word and until someone
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
begins that process it's restorative it
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
is not meant to be negative it's meant
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
to be restorative however on the way
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
that many people look at it it's like
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
this bad thing however when we look at
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
the process and the meaning for it and
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
if someone was at home raising
 
01:01:20.079 --> 01:01:22.829 align:start position:0%
if someone was at home raising
children

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
degree you know there should be some
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
discretion whether alimony should be
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
awarded after 20 years or not so um I
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%

are fast that one especially uh with the

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
session on House
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
Bill uh on 70 from last week which was
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
chairman muffet's bill this bill removes
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
military retirement benefits from
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
property settlement agreements as a
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
result of the dissolution of the
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
marriage in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think who was lined up
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
to make that
 
01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:10.789 align:start position:0%
to make that
motion

01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh I don't remember either but I can
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
Mar thank you Mr chairman I move would
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
you care to make a motion yes sir thank
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I move that we
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh declare that to be itl inexpedient to
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you sir and
 
01:04:32.359 --> 01:04:34.710 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you sir and
representative

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
it and I will say that um I've had a
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
conversation with the prime sponsor he
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
understands the concerns that we have in
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
um with this bill
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that uh we voiced and
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
um discussed some of these concerns last
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
time but it kind of is on theme with
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
where we are today it's the same
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
situation with alimony um being that
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
military spouses have an even larger um
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
burden as far as you know moving not
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
being able to work all these things and
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
so this is a necessary thing and as
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
representative grman so eloquently said
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
this is about restorative things when a
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
marriage fails and so um this bill
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
troubles me that it would take away that
 
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.390 align:start position:0%
troubles me that it would take away that
restorative

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
feature thank you representative any
 
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
feature thank you representative any
further

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
comments representative Raymond thank
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
you um I I agree I also want to just
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
point out that um I think that as the
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
chairman was saying earlier there are
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
some bills that people listen to what we
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
have to say and then they come back with
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
a A change I I think in this case um
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
part of the issue was that
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
um that this was a one-size fits all or
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
one size fits none um so I think if
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
someone came back and said we want a
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill that would have judicial training
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
so that the judges know that it doesn't
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
have to be 50/50 it can be case
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
dependent that would be something that I
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
could get behind um because judges do
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
have discretion and they shouldn't be
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
doing 5050 in every case they should be
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
looking at all of these um criteria that
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
are set out by um the US uh former
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
spouse protection act and so I I would
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
love to um not just quash the idea of
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
making changes that help people but like
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
really focusing on how do we make the
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
changes so that they apply to a VI a
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
wide variety of circumstances and not
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
experience representative
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chair yeah I won't be
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
voting for the itl uh for the reason
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a pension uh even though it
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
says pension up the top uh we we heard
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
retainer okay meaning uh you know uh if
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
you and I had a contract I I retain the
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
right to call you back to work and here
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
here's some money for for you to do you
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
know for us to to uh to do that contract
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about uh alimony
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about child support
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
this is just a
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's not property you know as as
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
a as a a pension would be or um you know
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
IRAs and things like that uh this is a
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
this is still an an an active act that
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
this that the retiree has to has to uh
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
he's obligated to you it's the
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
government um you know they're they're
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh they're restricted to their conduct
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
mandates could cause them to lose it uh
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
that their employment uh they can't they
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
can't go overseas and work for as one uh
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
one guy said uh work for Saudi Arabia uh
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
you know without approval this isn't
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
just a a plain everyday retirement
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
account that uh that so many of us are
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
used to this is something much different
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
and um you know like I said I'll be
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
this representative George thank you
 
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.149 align:start position:0%
this representative George thank you
chairman

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
um I think so except for if there is a
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
for the good
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
cause and um like um the chairman D said
 
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.349 align:start position:0%
cause and um like um the chairman D said
for

01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
50/50 to look
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
what um they are going through and then
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
what they do all for the like the
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
property they they cannot put that like
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
the pension inside if they give
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
everything because I see like it's a lot
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
for one person for me that I see like
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
50/50 representative
 
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
50/50 representative
marel

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
marel
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
um well I can respectfully disagree it
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
is a pension um even though it was
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
characterized as not being a pension it
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
also requires the equivalent of a
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
qualified Domestic Relations order to be
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
able to transfer the retire the plan
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
participants interest to the alternate
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
paye um so it has to go through a
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
specific military process for it and
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
it's rather
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
complicated um so the other thing is in
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
closing is is that it's only one part of
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
the marital pie in New Hampshire when
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
people marry virtually everything they
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
have which is both assets and debts
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
enters into the marital mix the uh
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
pension rights in military are only one
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and to separate that out I
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
think is going to undermine the purposes
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
of these of the present statutes so I
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully renew my uh motion to
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%

dry I represent Sullivan County district
 
01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:57.189 align:start position:0%
dry I represent Sullivan County district
7

01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm here
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
today because life throws
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
curveballs experiences in my own family
 
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.550 align:start position:0%
curveballs experiences in my own family
and

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
friends uh of parties being married at
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
17 years of age have convinced me that
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is an option that
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
works when the marriage bill passed last
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
year raising the age of 18 of marriage
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
to 18 with no exceptions I immediately
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
thought of exceptions where it might
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
might be nice to at least have an option
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the table and one exception that
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
immediately struck me as reasonable and
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
logical is those on active duty in the
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
military this exception shows up for
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
example in the state of Alaska where the
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
age of marriage is 18 but there is an
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
exception for those on active duty
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
military the age
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
of uh being able to support a child or
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
being have to support a child medically
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
or by child support in our own New
 
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.950 align:start position:0%
or by child support in our own New
Hampshire

01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
statutes declare that that stops when
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
someone becomes 18 becomes emancipated
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
or is on active duty in the military
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
that triumphant appears in other places
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
in our law where people are considered
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
adult by being either over 18
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
emancipated minor or an active duty in

Corps I realized as I watched them leave
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the house that there was a very real
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
chance that they might not come
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
home we have a volunteer military now
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
but if we ever do have a draft marriage
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
might be an option that some would like
 
01:24:05.159 --> 01:24:06.550 align:start position:0%
might be an option that some would like
to

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
choose this bill has been crafted as
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
possible at least one party has to be
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
active duty military at least one party
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
has to be a New Hampshire resident we
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't want New Hampshire to be Las Vegas
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
where people come just to get married
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
and any party who is not on active duty
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
military but is 17 must have parental
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
consent there may be people here today
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
that call this child marriage because
 
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
that call this child marriage because
you're

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
17 but I have never heard a 17-year-old
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
Soldier be called Child
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
Soldier persons in New Hampshire can
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
give consent for sexual contact with
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
adults at age
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
16 but marriages for bidden until
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
18 that's quite a disconnect we consider
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
16-year-olds old enough to consent to
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
sex but don't consider 17-year-olds old
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
enough to consent to
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
marriage I have received a bulk email
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
from all over the US asking me not to
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
bring child abuse back to New Hampshire
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
well perhaps the age of consent law is
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
the child abuse and the ability to marry
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
in the case for example of pregnancy
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
would be child protection that is
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
protecting and providing for the child
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
way I am not changing the law in New
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill does not repeal last
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
year's bill I repeat this does not
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
change the law it merely adds a narrowly
 
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.070 align:start position:0%
change the law it merely adds a narrowly
crafted

01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
crafted
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
exemption providing an option for those
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
who put their lives on the line for our
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
country to provide
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
for the ones they love and I asked you
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
to vote this bill ought to pass and I
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor representative
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
LC um since the thank you Mr whatever I
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
am yeah sorry thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
chairman oh thank you sorry I haven't
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
had that much coffee
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
yet it's in the other room um since the
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
marriage law has been in effect for um
 
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
30 days yet do you see that this bill is
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
necessary or do you think that we should
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
give this more time to get into effect
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
so that way if there is a problem we can
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
address it next next term well if you
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
rem thank you for the question if you
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
remember last year that was an attempt
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh attempted um there were some
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
attempted amendments at this and there
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
were exceptions brought up that would
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
like to been added to this I felt at the
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
time that it was just um a cut off
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
without much discussion about whether
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
there could be some exemptions uh so I'm
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
thinking that while it is new and there
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is a good time to add
 
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.189 align:start position:0%
this is a good time to add
exemptions

01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
followup and do you see an issue when it
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
comes to if the couple do get married
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then try to get a divorce and due to
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
service members civil re Relief act
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
could come into effect when it comes to
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
them being overseas and their partner is
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get a divorce and divorce
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
proceedings have to be on hold until
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
that member comes back and I don't want
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
to think it but some members May extend
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
their um deployment so that way they
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to get a
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
divorce thank you for the question I
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a worst case scenario and
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at there will be other cases
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios other questions representative
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%

you for taking my question I appreciate
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
it um my question is about active uh
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
duty military and and so uh it says on
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill very many times active duty
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the definition of
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
active duty and I wondered if you could
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
explain it does that count like basic
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
training or is it not till after like at
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
what point does active duty start starts
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
with basic training okay so is it as
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
soon as you've signed the recruitment
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
letter or after you have been sent down
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
to wherever you're going that's a better
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
question for somebody who might have
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%

01:29:05.719 --> 01:29:07.470 align:start position:0%
I just uh you know some there is some
kids

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
um graduate like at a 17 years old and
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
there isas not to everybody because I
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
know all my kids most of my kids just
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
have a uh graduate 18 but the youngest
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
graduate in 17 but not every kids
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
finish his school at 17 that the reason
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
maybe he cannot go to the military but
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
if he graduate 17 that he can go to the
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
military and for you you think so the 17
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
years old girl she's really with a mind
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
to to take care of really the
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
family she can take care of the family
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
married well I think she should have the
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
ability to make that decision
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have to choose to do this
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
but the ability is there to make a
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
choice to get married and she needs
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
parental consent if she's
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
17 follow up one followup yep thank you
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
know she she have ability but not
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
everyone the problem is if one can do it
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
not to all of them some some of the kids
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
are not really
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
mature that that is a problem too it's
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
for one person can be very smart can
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
just go do everything but not all all of
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
them this is this is the problem we
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
canot just please make sure this is a
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
question the testimony can be for the
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
exact session this is to elicit answers
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
from whoever is at the chair okay I'm
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
sorry just my question just like again
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
second week we're
 
01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
second week we're
new

01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative dry
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I left my
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
household at 17 years of age and I
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
cohabited with a an abuser and I was not
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
able to um seek help as I was a a minor
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
and would this enable somebody to seek
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
status okay could you repeat that again
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how this relates to this so
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry okay thank you for
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
the question so what I'm saying is that
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
um when we um when we voted on the um
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
the age of marriage being raised to to
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
18 17y olds no longer are able to go to
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
a a domestic violence shelter um and be
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
cared for um without uh being afraid
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
afraid of especially if they're young
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
mothers of of being separated from their
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
infant because she would go to one
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
foster home and the child would go to
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
another however um my question is um if
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
a if that 17-year-old mother is
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
emancipated she would have the same
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
rights as a a person in the age of
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
majority is that
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
correct I'm I believe so but that really
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
is not tied to this this is not Bill
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
part of the bill make sure you're
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
questions are about this bill for active
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
duty military folks other questions
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative LC um so with the active
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
duty thank you Mr chairman uh with the
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
active duty military um I looked at your
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill and it doesn't specify an age limit
 
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to active duty military
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
because um just doing a little bit of
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
research beforehand most of the military
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
branches go between the ages of 17 and
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
42 and is there any like would you
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
consider having a age stop for this bill
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
so that way we don't have a 42y old man
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
or a woman marrying a 17-year-old
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
child the idea is that thank you for the
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
question this this bill makes this
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
active duty person an exception to the
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
18year um minimum they would be then
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
17 okay because that's the the year that
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
you can be in the military but not yet
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
have reached the age of marriageability
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Petrino thank
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
my question I could have missed it and I
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
apologize if I did but what is the
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
motivation uh behind the legislation in
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
terms of making an exception for someone
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
who was 17 just because they're in the
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
military I mean why not make an
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
exception for all 17-year-olds you're 17
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
you're in love you want to get married
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
so I could have missed it but what do
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
you think thank you for the question
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
well some of this came from my
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
experience as a military mom and
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
understanding U kind of what you leave
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
behind when you go overseas uh both of
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
my sons saw um active duty in the war in
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
Iraq and it was very troubling for um
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
the family left behind I think that it
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
we are very fortunate that it is a
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
volunteer military right now but uh at
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
the time I was looking into this things
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
were heating up in the Middle East and
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
things were heating up in Ukraine and
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
the the word draft floated around a
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
little bit and I realized that if we
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to allow this exception for for a
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
time when there was a draft the wheels
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
of government move very slowly and uh it
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
would I would rather have something on
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
the books I'm not expecting a landslide
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
of people to come who are 17 marrying
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
17-year-old milit active duty military
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
but I would like this option to be here
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
books representative D
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
question taking into consideration your
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
statement about um the age of 16 as the
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
age of consent and uh I'd like to move
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
you forward to this type of a scenario
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're 17 years old you're engaging
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
in that behavior with an 18-year-old
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
military man who or woman who goes off
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
overseas or to another part of the
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
country a pregnancy takes
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
place the military person may not be
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
back in your vicinity for two to God
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
knows how many years the child is born
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
and now doesn't know the other parent
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
the other parent doesn't have any
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
interaction with that child on a regular
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
basis can't hug them hold them walk the
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
floors at night with them what kind of
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
an impact do
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
you possibly believe there could be not
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
only on the
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
child thank you for the question if I
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
understand it you're asking the benefit
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
to the child and this person and I
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand if they were married
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you if they were not married
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to the the mother
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
would not be able to be on the same base
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
as the military
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
person or in the other case the
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
father the mother could be on base give
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
birth to the child and the father
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be on base if if he
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
were 17 so I'm asking you what how
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
detrimental would that be to the child
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the family unit later on because
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to marry for four
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
to six or eight years thank you for the
 
01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
question now I understand yes I uh I
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
believe this is not only in the benefit
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
for the physical um material benefits
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
that come with marriage um including
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and medical insurance um but I
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
just realize how much the the benefits
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
of Housing and being maybe perhaps able
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
to Eon accomodate um someone traveling
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
overseas uh makes a difference soldiers
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
think about home when they're not in the
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
United States um and if they're provided
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
for well at home I think they rest a
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
little bit easier and I think that yes
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
you I agree that there more goes beyond
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
just kind of um physical benefits but
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
there are things like housing that you
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
you need to consider and how strict the
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
military really is about it being a
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative for your
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%

01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of this committee to
 
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
limit every subsequent testimony to
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes 3 minutes means

01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%

and at 3 I'll shut your mic off now this
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%

01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
requested three minutes or less and last
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
term the best speech I have ever heard
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
in nine years in the house was 47
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
seconds it was precise it was on point
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
it was compelling with that the chair
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Pearson and
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you um
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Katie Pell I
 
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of walboro and
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro and a representative dry told
 
01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
me about this bill just yesterday and I
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
thought oh that's definitely something I
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
can get behind I know a perfect example
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
of why this bill would be necessary in a
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
very small number of situations but as I
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
was listening to her testimony it
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that this is a really
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial Bill also to our military and
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give use my story as an
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
example of why that is I have a friend
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
who um found out when he was 18 that he
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
had fathered a child when he was 15 at
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
the same time as he was turning 18 he
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
discovered he had fathered another
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
child and he was doing drugs and getting
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
into all kinds of trouble so now he had
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
two children and he needed a to provide
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
for his
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
family and the way out was to join the
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
Navy and he was able to provide for his
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
family and have an exceptional military
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
career in the Navy in fact he almost
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
retired at one point or left the Navy at
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
one point went into recruiting realized
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
he had fallen back in love with the Navy
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
and continued out his 20 years and um
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
bears that um very proudly so I think
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
think this is a situation where it is
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
helpful to a very small number of people
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
in this person in this situation but
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
could also help somebody out of a very
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
challenging life situation I mean and we
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
have declining enrollment in the
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
military and we need we need these young
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
men willing to step up and if they have
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
a family that gives them motivation to
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
step up and serve their country and take
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
care of their
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
families thank you any questions for the
 
01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:53.470 align:start position:0%
families thank you any questions for the
representative

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony the
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hoy fellow Air Force Major thank you for
 
01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.550 align:start position:0%

your
 
01:41:11.229 --> 01:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
service and the hardest thing is to
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
remember to turn on your mic Bingo now
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%

good morning for the record I'm Shelley
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
hoik a retired major in the United
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
States Air Force I live in Hoppington
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm here to speak in
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposal that would
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire children to marry
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
military service members I'll will speak
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
to three of the unique realities of
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
military life which make this proposal
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous for our children the transient
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
lifestyle of military service the
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
uniform code of military Justice and the
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
financial pressure faced by Young
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
military families the life of a military
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
service member is transient and
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
unpredictable in my first two years in
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
the Air Force I had five permanent outof
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
State moves the shortest was 6 weeks in
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
D duration and the longest long EST
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
distance was okaa Japan this is relevant
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
because every time a military spouse
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
arrives at a new Duty station he or she
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
is completely isolated until he or she
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
creates her own support system of
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
friends in a new community this support
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
system is your lifeline when your
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
service member is called away can you
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
imagine being a 17-year-old child
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of miles away from
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
everything and everyone you know trying
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
to develop a network of friends she
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
won't be successful when the military
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
memb away she will literally be home
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
alone for months at a time what if the
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
military member isn't deployed but is
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
abusive this happens in the military to
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
whom can the child spouse turn for help
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're thinking call the police that
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
brings me to my second point of military
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
life the mum J military law is different
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
from civilian law in that a service
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
members Commander has sole discretion of
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
whether and how to punish any crime
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
committed by that service member on base
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
I volunteered with the great crisis
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
Council when I was stationed in okanawa
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
Japan I saw firsthand how commanders
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
make the decision of whether and how to
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
punish members of their own team I
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
specifically recall the case of a female
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
marine who was raped in her own bed the
 
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
facts were uncontested the male broke
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
into her lock dorm room while she was
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
sleeping and had forceable sex with her
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
there was no prior relationship and she
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
did everything right screamed for help
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
called the police
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
fought her attacker immed um submitted
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
to the exam and filed a complaint I was
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
there when the decision was made not to
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
punish her attacker no lawyers judges or
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
police were present the commander opted
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
not to pursue the punishment because it
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
would unfairly Mar the clearing record
 
01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
of a marine who had a promising career
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
if this is how they respond to violence
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
on one of their own a fellow Marine how
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
high do you think a commander is going
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
to Value the well-being of a 17-year-old
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
child from New Hampshire the third
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
relevant reality of military life is
 
01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.870 align:start position:0%
relevant reality of military life is
consistent

01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
245 the third reality is the financial
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
struggle that these people face when
 
01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
struggle that these people face when
they're

01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
young military member a 17-year old
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
without a high school diploma or with
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
one is not going to be able to compete
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
for an on-based job time thank you for
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony and any questions
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
for the

you for that and for your testimony and
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
when I was born on a military base in
 
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
Germany my dad was in Okinawa so I
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the any other
 
01:44:50.199 --> 01:44:53.629 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the any other
questions

01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you so much for
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
testifying and taking my question so I'm
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to go back to the when does active
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
it says in the law the language says
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
active duty so when does that start does
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
that start when you go to the Air Force
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
Academy does it start when you finish
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
basic training like at what point is
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
this person active thank you for the
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
question um in my understanding is that
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
the day that you show up at the me
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
station for this is for enlisted person
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
when you show up at the me station you
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and you're sworn in and
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
then you get on the bus to go straight
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
to basic training that's the moment when
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
your active duty a a Cadet in the armed
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry in in the school service
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools sorry um is is not active duty
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
and they're not allowed to marry until
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
they graduate okay I'm sorry I might be
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
wrong about whether they are active duty
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
but they are cadets and they're not
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to marry until they grad wait
 
01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank you so um so I
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
guess my question is then procedurally
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
how would that work if someone is
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to get married to their High
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
School boyfriend or girlfriend but the
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
person has to go off to basic if they're
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
not if they're active when they get
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
sworn in but then they have to literally
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
get on a bus and leave is there a is
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
between or is it they have to wait till
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
the six or eight weeks of training is
 
01:46:27.149 --> 01:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
done I'm not sure whether I mean there
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
are moments and hours that you're
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
waiting for the bus after you sign in
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
there could be a special
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
logistical I I can't answer that
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
intelligently I'm sorry thank you I'm
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
sorry it's been I'm old enough that it's
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
been quite some years since my high
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
school boyfriend joined the Coast Guard
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember how it worked I
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't think I went with him to the
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
swearing in so thank you any other
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay your backlighted yes
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
there you are representative LC thank
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
service um my dad was a Air Force bet
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
and um he enjoyed it very much um my
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
question is uh so when you sign up for
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
the military there you give you were
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
given like a stack of paperwork which
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
can be overwhelming um in there uh is
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
there a paperwork that you can sign that
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
list anybody as the beneficiary to
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
receive the
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
benefits um for from the military you're
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
testing my memory thank you for the
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
question um as I recall it doesn't
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
happen until after you get to basic
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
training you go to a whole bunch of
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
different classes and in each one you
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
learn about a new form and so it's
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
during basic training that you assign
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries in in my long
 
01:47:43.679 --> 01:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries in in my long
ago

01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%

committee thank you uh representative
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
Terry Rory Rockingham 32 chairman of
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice I here as a co-sponsor
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill today and here to testify on
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the bill to be clear I don't
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
think getting married at 17 is a great
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
idea I think if we had the power we
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
should maybe make it 35 before you can
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
get married um maybe older um having
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
said that November 13th 1986 I was 17
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
years old I reported to the me station
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
for basic training I was 17 I was um I
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
just finished high school I was um young
 
01:48:43.629 --> 01:48:43.639 align:start position:0%
for my for my class one of the youngest
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
in my class uh my first Duty station I
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
was sent over to West Germany country
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't even exist anymore um
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
that's how old I am I'm older than some
 
01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.750 align:start position:0%
that's how old I am I'm older than some
countri

01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
having said that um I was um not
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
probably smart but lucky I didn't I
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
would wasn't wasn't married didn't need
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
to be married but I can see the reason
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
for this exception and I would urge
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
members who fought so hard for the
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
18-year-old not to see this as chipping
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
away at your work or or loosening it
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
this is a very fine exception whereby if
 
01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.629 align:start position:0%
this is a very fine exception whereby if
a

01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
soldier goes to basic training um
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is a break in basic
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
training I heard the question question
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
brought up I went to basic training in
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
November we had I forgot what the term
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
was but at Christmas we had a break and
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
we went home for 2 weeks and we had to
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
go back which was horrific I wish they
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
would have never done that um because it
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
was like starting basic training on day
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
one again having said that um there is
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
time before that and there's several
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
weeks usually before you get shipped off
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to a duty station if you have the
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um luck that you made a bad
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
decision and your partner is pregnant
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
and you are getting shipped over to
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
another country for your duty station to
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
the other side of the planet she needs
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
medical care she needs prenatal care
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
that child's going to need medical care
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the military is not going to provide
 
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
it unless they're married um so this
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
that is so important to get that
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
prenatal care and to to have support for
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
her even if she can't go with you the
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
military has extensive support networks
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
to help single spouses that are back
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
there waiting for their soldiers so I I
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
would urge you to look at this from that
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
perspective this is to qualify it's
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
probably less than one tenth of 1% but
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
right now somewhere out there in New
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there might be a pregnant
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
woman right now wondering how she's
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to take care of this child uh
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
because her Soldier is is being sent
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
away so I would I would ask you to
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
consider it as that it's a narrow narrow
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
exception and I'll take any questions
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative any
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions that don't relate to how old I
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire has already done what

Bill
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
433 I think that it's uh necessary to
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that if somebody u under the
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
age of 18 that might be a parent because
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
the law is 16 you might be a parent when
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
you're 18 but if you can't get married
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
and you go off to war and God forbid you
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
get killed I'd like to see some kind of
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
um military support for the
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%

01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
years um when I got married I quit
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%

make

01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%

18 um my wife and I knew each other
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%

01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
sign legal consent for us to get married
 
01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:28.599 align:start position:0%

story seconds do not thank me for my
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
service if you plan to use it as an
 
01:59:12.669 --> 01:59:12.679 align:start position:0%
excuse to justify the abuses that occur
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
if we allow child marriage in our
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
society under any circumstances under

representative Greg first of all this
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
sincerus thank you for your service and
 
01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
for your bravery in telling your story I
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
know that's not easy oh thank you Mr
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairman for letting me do this and
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so just
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
to clarify at 17 your parents signed
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
permission for you to marry
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
someone thank you representative yes
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct children do not consent
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
to marriage their parents consent to
 
01:59:51.159 --> 01:59:54.870 align:start position:0%
to marriage their parents consent to
marriage

01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
I was listening to
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
your genuinely heart-rending story and I
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
wonder would it not been pretty similar
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
older that's a fair question and yes
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
because I would have then been illegal
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
adult which would have meant which would
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
have meant that I had access to divorce
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
which would have meant that I would have
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
had Access to Health Care without the
 
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
permission of my spouse MH who was
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%

before you divorced
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%

Hampshire you can file for divorce at 17

Hearn and I work alongside Unchained at
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
last as a volunteer
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
maintaining New Hampshire's ban on child
 
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
marriage is not about maturity we know
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
that turning 18 does not suddenly endow
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
someone with Newfound wisdom however as
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously on their 18th
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
birthday individuals do gain all the
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
rights of adulthood that they did not
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
have the day before this is especially
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
important in cases where a minor might
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
be forced into marriage a minor being
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
forced to marry a service member can't
 
02:02:17.069 --> 02:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
simply open the door and run away to
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
avoid that forced marriage a minor who
 
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
runs away from home repeatedly can be
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
deemed a child in need of services and
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
summoned to a court hearing to determine
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
further intervention even if they could
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
run away there's nowhere for them to go
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
Advocates who provide Direct Services to
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
these minors have found that domestic
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
Ser domestic violence shelters across
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
the US routinely turn away unaccompanied
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
miners even emancipated
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
Miners youth shelters are also not a
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
solution as they're not confidential and
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
typically only allow a 21-day stay as
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
their main goal is to reunite the minors
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
with their parents who may have been the
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
ones to force them into to this child
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
marriage while an adult in this
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
situation could retain an attorney to
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
help them figure out their complex legal
 
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
needs a minor cannot because contracts
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
with miners are voidable miners are not
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
even allowed to bring legal action
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
independently as you've heard miners are
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
automatically emancipated upon marriage
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
gaining limited adult rights however
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
these rights do not prevent forced
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
marriages which can typically mean being
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
removed from school and raped on her
 
02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
wedding night the trauma of such
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
experiences cannot be erased by granting
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
a man IP ation that is why all child
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
marriage is globally recognized as forc
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
marriage because miners lack the
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
necessary legal rights to enter a
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
contract as serious as marriage when
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
girls facing forced marriages seek help
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
from direct service providers like
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
Unchained at last they often dis
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
discover their legal options are very
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
limited their desperation can sometimes
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
lead to self harm or even attempted
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
suicide as they see no other way to
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
escape what feels like an unbearable
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
situation for these reasons I ask that
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
you oppose HB 433 and I thank you very
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for your
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%

02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
elderly eyes and may not get the first
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%

an advocate from my traumatic experience
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
I founded Unchained at last to end force
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
and child marriage in the US including
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I'm here as an
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
expert my research and writing on this
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
issue have been published extensively I
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
ear Ur you to vote no on HB 433 let's
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
not undo the progress we made last year
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
when we ended child marriage in New
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first of all child marriage
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
and a military contacts is dangerous we
 
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
at Unchained have worked with many
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
survivors who were forced as minors to
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
marry service members at age 17 forced
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
to marry a service member why should a
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
girl in that situation get any less
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
protection than a girl being forced to
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
marry a civilian I can't think of any
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
reason child marriage is associated with
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
high rates of domestic violence and you
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit here from firsthand
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
accounts and others um how hard it is to
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
get help in a domestic violence
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
situation in the military so not only is
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
it the the police situation reporting it
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
but also think about the fact that
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
military spouses um can be alienated
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
from their family and friends because
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
they move frequently and so it becomes
 
02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:43.719 align:start position:0%
very hard for them to develop that that
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh circle of trust that they need to get
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
help in a domestic violence situation um
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
and you heard here before somebody
 
02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
testify a child marriage works 70 to 80%
 
02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
divorce rate child marriage does not
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
work it's unlikely this is going to work
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
out highly likely that this girl is
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
going to need help and not be able to
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
get it on a military base now um and you
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
also heard how hard it is to serve a
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
service member so if this girl wants to
 
02:06:09.549 --> 02:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
get divorced how trapped she can become
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
even though she's technically
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
emancipated and has the rights of
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
adulthood now child marriage in a
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
military context also is unnecessary you
 
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
heard about that heartbreaking situation
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh a girl Mar a girls not married to her
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
boyfriend who deploys and he dies in
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
service to this country and now she's
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
left destitute you can assign your death
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
benefits and your life insurance in the
 
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
military to anyone you want regardless
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
of your marital status you don't have to
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
marry for that reason and um for a
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
17-year-old who needs health and housing
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
resources we should never ever write
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that encourages or requires
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
girls in that terrible situation to
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
marry service members so that they can
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
get these resources they deserve and can
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
get resources that do not require them
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
to enter into an adult sexual
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
relationship with lifelong repercussions
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
and of course the service members
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
benefits would extend to their children
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of their marital status now
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
bringing back marriage at age 17 even if
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's only the slight little um you know
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
exception for military also would bring
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
back the legal trafficking of minors
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
under the guise of marriage and that's
 
02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
because federal law doesn't specify a
 
02:07:22.589 --> 02:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
minimum age for marriage instead it
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
defers to state law and so that means
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
17-year-olds in the state would again be
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to be trafficked for their
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
citizenship 15 seconds left in myif last
 
02:07:33.069 --> 02:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
15 seconds I will say you heard about
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
Alaska having a military exception to
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
the marriage age that is a law that was
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
written in 1975 and has not been updated
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
other than Alaska we don't know of a
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
single state in the entire world with a
 
02:07:46.350 --> 02:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
military exception to the marriage age
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%

DCF uh we heard testimonies from the
 
03:12:20.910 --> 03:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate various
 
03:12:23.070 --> 03:12:23.080 align:start position:0%

testimony from current and um former
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
foster parents and and what we heard was
 
03:12:36.830 --> 03:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
that a lot of foster parents are feeling
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
isolated they're feeling lonely they're
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
feeling that the children's needs are
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
not being met uh a lot feel that they
 
03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
have a lack of support they reported
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
dysfunction within the agency uh
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the courts and so we heard
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony we took we took it very
 
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
seriously in fact the senator and I even
 
03:12:57.150 --> 03:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
met with some Milford constituents in a
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
coffee shop because they were unable to
 
03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
attend and we heard their testimony as
 
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
well so the bottom line is after a lot
 
03:13:05.950 --> 03:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
of work that we did over the summer it
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
was recommended that we put forth this
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can continue to hear uh
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
the needs of foster parents and also to
 
03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
maintain oversight over DCF in this
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%

03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
to protect you all um we are here on uh
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
to support this bill um I did attend
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
most of the the sessions this summer
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
with representative deimon and
 
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative patrino and
 
03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:30.269 align:start position:0%
representative patrino and
representative

03:14:30.269 --> 03:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Greg oh oh she's not there okay I was
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
like where is she um so and we had also
 
03:14:37.790 --> 03:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
reached out in our networks and had met
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of foster um parent uh
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
groups they meet kind of informally
 
03:14:43.950 --> 03:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
there's Facebook groups and we had
 
03:14:45.389 --> 03:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
reached out to them via Facebook to
 
03:14:47.790 --> 03:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
invite them so we all also got a lot of
 
03:14:49.630 --> 03:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
feedback not everyone could make it to
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
the committee but that there was um a
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
lot of discourse that they would like to
 
03:14:57.070 --> 03:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
be having so we do feel like this would
 
03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
be nice to create this space within the
 
03:15:01.630 --> 03:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
03:15:04.030 --> 03:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
services specifically because that body
 
03:15:06.750 --> 03:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
already Hears A lot of these same issues
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
but from a more systemic level um so it
 
03:15:10.750 --> 03:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
would be really nice to create this
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
space for foster parents specifically to
 
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
be able to come and feel like they can
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
share that with a group that is really
 
03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
dedic ated to listening to these issues
 
03:15:20.189 --> 03:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to share that
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
perspective from having attended this
 
03:15:24.189 --> 03:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
summer and and I just want to add very
 
03:15:26.189 --> 03:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
briefly um that we heard from those
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
foster parents that they really
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
appreciated the attention and the time
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
um they were feeling a lack of support
 
03:15:33.710 --> 03:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
by the division um I recently have not
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
heard that same level of concern but I
 
03:15:37.469 --> 03:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
know at that time it was very heightened
 
03:15:39.790 --> 03:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
there was a a lot of um needs that they
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
had that weren't being met and so having
 
03:15:44.590 --> 03:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
the space to be heard um made them feel
 
03:15:46.189 --> 03:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
valued in their role and want to
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
continue and attention of our foster
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
parents is critical to the safety and
 
03:15:51.309 --> 03:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
well-being of our children and so we
 
03:15:53.630 --> 03:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to support that however
 
03:15:55.950 --> 03:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
possible thank you any questions for the
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%

director for DCF we really don't have
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
any testimony to provide today um we are
 
03:16:50.590 --> 03:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
not in opposition to this bill um as
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
many know in this room we have worked
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to improve especially this
 
03:16:56.750 --> 03:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
over the summer going to these meetings
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
hearing from the foster parents what
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
they need because it's not only about
 
03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
retaining um I'm sorry about recruiting
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
these foster parents especially now with
 
03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
kinship care and recruiting these uh
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
special kinship Care Homes but retaining
 
03:17:13.950 --> 03:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
them working with them to make them feel
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
supported so we have no no opposition to
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a a a community oversight of
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
helping us working with us and problem
 
03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
solving and working to the good of
 
03:17:26.590 --> 03:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining these uh very
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
special pieces of this complicated
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
puzzle would it be your opinion that the
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
quality work done by this subcommittee
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be akin to the quality work done
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittees for me who chair
 
03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS oversight that oversight
 
03:17:46.990 --> 03:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are a good thing with that
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony that would be my
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony I was hoping so yes
 
03:17:55.950 --> 03:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
great yes I agree oh anything else you
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%

everybody looks so
 
03:19:19.479 --> 03:19:21.269 align:start position:0%
everybody looks so
happy

03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
happy
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
well in fact even one of our happy
 
03:19:31.110 --> 03:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
joy she wants
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
me why that would be representative Greg
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I really think
 
03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
that this uh um is it a commission
 
03:19:44.229 --> 03:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee whatever that we're
 
03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
establishing is very important I sat on
 
03:19:46.479 --> 03:19:47.429 align:start position:0%
establishing is very important I sat on
the

03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:49.189 --> 03:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
on the foster care special committee
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
over the summer and it it felt like that
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
that bowl of pasta the more we dug into
 
03:19:56.510 --> 03:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
it the more there was and so it's uh
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a challenging thing but a
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
very very important thing so I'm happy
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
to support
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
this representative D
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chair although I Echo
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh both representative patrino and
 
03:20:12.990 --> 03:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Greg sentiments I also
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
want to say that I'll use a different
 
03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
analogy there are so many layers to the
 
03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
foster care program and we've added two
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
more layers with the kinship and fictive
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
care that I think that this type of a
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on that commission is
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary for us to be able
 
03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
to learn and and help um the department
 
03:20:44.750 --> 03:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
learn what good we can do with these
 
03:20:46.830 --> 03:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
foster care programs I was in in a
 
03:20:46.840 --> 03:20:47.790 align:start position:0%
foster care programs I was in in a
meeting

03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:20:50.590 --> 03:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday and we were talking about the
 
03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
need for more Foster families to keep
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
kids out of placement in
 
03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
kids out of placement in
particular

03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
facilities so if we're going to keep the
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
kids out of those facilities and put
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
them in loving caring
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
homes I think this will do it thank you
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:21:23.469 --> 03:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
Malone so I have been a foster mom as
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
well as a kinship provider here in New
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 25 years anything that we
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
can do to promote the strength and the
 
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
support that Foster families get is just
 
03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to strengthen the system most
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
Foster families they're trying really
 
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
hard to reunite these children with
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
their families which means they have to
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
have training on on trauma that comes
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
from these families being able to not
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
hold a grudge against biof families when
 
03:21:55.389 --> 03:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
you see some of the reports that come
 
03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
through and it's not easy um your
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
children also go through this vicarious
 
03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
trauma that the other children have come
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
into your house um so again whether
 
03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're related and I've done both um I
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
just had my last one just aged out she's
 
03:22:13.389 --> 03:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
going to be with us until she's 20
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
because she took the after care um
 
03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
because she took the after care um
that's

03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:22:20.830 --> 03:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
provided 25 years ago we barely had any
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
support as Foster families and we even
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
stopped doing it for a while because it
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
felt like you did not know where you
 
03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.670 --> 03:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
incredible my point earlier
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um oversight committees I think have a
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of Great Value because you bring
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
people with various aspects of the
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
subject together in the same room and
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cross fertilization
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
what is lost however sometimes is so
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
many of us have become generalists a
 
03:22:57.550 --> 03:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
specific subject doesn't get dealt with
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the depth it's it is needed and I
 
03:23:03.070 --> 03:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
think by having a subcommittee under
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee you have the
 
03:23:09.070 --> 03:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of both um a large synthetic
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
way of looking at things but also going
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
deep into specific things and I found in
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
my oversight committee which is da HHS
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
case seeing no further comments the bill
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
before us is House Bill
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%

03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%

sorry 15 to none with one
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
absence and I've got a great idea we
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
could put this one on consent any
 
03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:47.269 align:start position:0%
could put this one on consent any
objections

03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
objections
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
no objection so onto consent it goes and
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Petrino if you haven't
 
03:24:55.469 --> 03:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
already written your report on this
 
03:24:57.550 --> 03:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
please do so and pass it along before
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
you leave
 
03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
tonight we have um our next uh that
 
03:25:04.710 --> 03:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
closes the executive session on 478 our
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
553 and we must wait exactly 6 minutes
 
03:25:11.309 --> 03:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
before we
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
start um as often as the case and I have
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
one of these tomorrow
 
03:25:20.229 --> 03:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that you we have all looked
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
at is often replaced in whole or part by
 
03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:26.750 align:start position:0%
at is often replaced in whole or part by
an

03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:25:29.030 --> 03:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's important because
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes the things we didn't like in a
 
03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
particular Bill the amendment has taken
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
out so I would suggest in the five and a
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
half minutes we have left you should
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.399 --> 03:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
Bill

03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
553 and I would suggest you read it over
 
03:25:52.750 --> 03:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Greg who will be
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill will speak to this
 
03:25:58.630 --> 03:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
when it is her turn to but in the
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.990 --> 03:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.510 --> 03:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
and just while you're reading it over
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and not chatting amongst yourselves um
 
03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
this Amendment only replaces one section
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
of it so note that this is not a replace
 
03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:58.309 align:start position:0%
of it so note that this is not a replace
all

03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.150 --> 03:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.160 --> 03:27:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
not

03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:45.120 --> 03:28:15.110 align:start position:0%

03:28:45.040 --> 03:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:45.030 align:start position:0%

03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%

03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%

03:32:10.750 --> 03:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
I open the hearing on House Bill
 
03:32:13.950 --> 03:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
553 an act relative to the definition of
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and conditions
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
triggering a rebuttable presumption of
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
harm in abuse in neglect cases with the
 
03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor our very own
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you chairman
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
Pearson and thank you fellow committee
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
members um for the record my name is
 
03:32:33.150 --> 03:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
Alicia Greg I represent national award 7
 
03:32:35.950 --> 03:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to be here before you today um
 
03:32:37.710 --> 03:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
I would first like to point to the
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
OS had the bill apparently there were
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
some miscommunications and came out with
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
some things that um not only myself but
 
03:32:55.550 --> 03:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
also the um stakeholders that we talked
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
to in the original committee that worked
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
on this did not agree to so we this is
 
03:33:01.189 --> 03:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
just taking that back to the original
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
language that was agreed upon um this
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
particular Bill comes from a study
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh headed by Senator Carson
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
and also former Senator Whitley it had
 
03:33:14.189 --> 03:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
actually our own representative McMahon
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
on it as well they worked very hard this
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
last year and trying to figure out what
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
we could do to update our definitions of
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
child abuse and neglect and that's where
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
this language comes from with a little
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
bit more refinement afterwards there are
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
few things that can bring people
 
03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
together like the protection of children
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
what we are gathered here today to
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
discuss is that very
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
topic when we first looked at this bill
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
when I first got this bill there was
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
some discussion amongst people do we
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
name this bill do we name it after some
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
of our most tragic cases that have been
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the news certainly not the most
 
03:33:52.269 --> 03:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
tragic overall but the ones that we hear
 
03:33:57.870 --> 03:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
about Javon Riley Briel Gage Buu vaugh
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
Elijah Lewis Harmony Montgomery or any
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
of our broken babies the possib list of
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
polic abilities is far too long
 
03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately we decided that this bill
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
once it gets amended and refined belongs
 
03:34:15.870 --> 03:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
to all kids in the granite state I've
 
03:34:17.469 --> 03:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
sat with many of you on different
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
committees the committee looking at DCF
 
03:34:22.189 --> 03:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
the committee looking at family courts
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
and Foster Care one thing that is
 
03:34:27.990 --> 03:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
glaringly important is that something is
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
missing far too many kids are ending up
 
03:34:31.680 --> 03:34:34.309 align:start position:0%
missing far too many kids are ending up
incredibly

03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.389 --> 03:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
hurt so when we look at our bills that
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
we have before this committee 169c I
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
like to refer to as kind of our Holy
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
Grail it's the child protection act and
 
03:34:47.710 --> 03:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
anytime we want to open that up and look
 
03:34:51.150 --> 03:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
at it it's a big deal and it has to come
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the highest level of attention and
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's what's happened for 45 years this
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
has sat with not a good or um robust
 
03:35:03.309 --> 03:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
revision on what defines abuse and
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
neglect in our state while we continue
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
to make attempts to Band-Aid or correct
 
03:35:11.070 --> 03:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
what we already have we have yet to go
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
back to this foundational piece it's
 
03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like if you have a foundation of
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
a house that can continues to crumble
 
03:35:19.229 --> 03:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
and you just put new sighting on it's
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
never actually going to work that
 
03:35:22.269 --> 03:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
sighting is going to pop off
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
everything's going to be unstable we
 
03:35:26.189 --> 03:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the foundation and
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that until this we
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
haven't done it now this was attempted
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
last year I believe it was Senate Bill
 
03:35:36.150 --> 03:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
459 we had these definitions a lot of
 
03:35:38.830 --> 03:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
this language is very similar with one
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
big change had a very large fiscal note
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
on it this one while it does have a
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note still listed will have no
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note this has no cost um which is
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
great on this slim budget
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
year now I look back because I thought
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
45 years first of all I was a little
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
shocked that 1980 was 45 years ago um so
 
03:36:02.830 --> 03:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
I had to double check
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
myself but believe it or not it was and
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
I was definitely old enough and if
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
you're my age or close to you might
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
remember when you could ride on the
 
03:36:14.469 --> 03:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
middle hump in the car or I even rode in
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
my grandma's back window
 
03:36:18.429 --> 03:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
and that was okay then we knew that it
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
was okay and this is 1980 this is when
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
this language was first
 
03:36:25.189 --> 03:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
devised but the thing is when we know
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
better we do better we've had a lot of
 
03:36:29.309 --> 03:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
advancements we've had a lot more
 
03:36:32.670 --> 03:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
learning about what happens with
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
kids so after I got this language from
 
03:36:37.469 --> 03:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson it was incredibly
 
03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
important for me to go to the
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that had been a part of
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
those conversations one by one and say
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
what is your input on this let's
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
here hours and hours and hours this last
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
fall actually I think this is so
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
important I waited to give it to my
 
03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors until I had a more refined
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
language from the people that work in
 
03:37:00.670 --> 03:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
this day in and day out now we have a
 
03:37:02.590 --> 03:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
really exceptional position here in the
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
children and family law because we get
 
03:37:06.750 --> 03:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
to hear from all of these stakeholders
 
03:37:08.750 --> 03:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
so while one particular group might be
 
03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
very focused on one area of the law is
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
our job to look at all focuses and not
 
03:37:15.630 --> 03:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
just to say well we want to make make
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
sure we hone this in on one thing and
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
not the others what the child protection
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
act does is it says the kids this is
 
03:37:28.510 --> 03:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
about child protection this bill is a
 
03:37:32.590 --> 03:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
civil bill because it's a civil matter
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is just about definitions of child
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect this is not
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutory this is not about the
 
03:37:40.830 --> 03:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
criminal side of it that's something
 
03:37:44.189 --> 03:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
different this is just about the
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
definitions um
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
and I understand that it's challenging
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come in and question our
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
parenting there's nothing more personal
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
than your parenting style there just
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
isn't that doesn't mean that what we're
 
03:38:01.309 --> 03:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
doing is always right I have my own
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
personal experiencing having my
 
03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
personal experiencing having my
parenting

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
questioned and while it wasn't easy I
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
understood the necessity because I
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
wanted the safety of my children for
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
those of you that don't know I'm a
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Survivor
 
03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:19.479 align:start position:0%
I also spend my time talking to groups
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
about what domestic violence is breaking
 
03:38:23.469 --> 03:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
down those stigmas and really saying
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
what is it because believe it or not I
 
03:38:26.910 --> 03:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
lived in it for 18 years and didn't
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
realize that it was a violent that it
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
was a domestic violent relationship I
 
03:38:34.030 --> 03:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
just thought he was a jerk um and that I
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably needed to do a lot better that
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
I was getting punishment because I
 
03:38:39.870 --> 03:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't worthy took me 18 years to figure
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
that out I never thought about the flip
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
side of that I specialized in helping
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
other victims and stuff until one time I
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
was taking um I was talking to a school
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
a trade school about what domestic
 
03:38:56.189 --> 03:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
violence looks like and I had somebody
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
come up to me after and they said so I
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
think I'm an abuser could you please
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
talk to me and it's at that point I
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
realized and in talking to her
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that even though some
 
03:39:10.269 --> 03:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
people don't realize they're being
 
03:39:12.150 --> 03:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
controlled or what of sometimes we're
 
03:39:14.710 --> 03:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
making decisions based on how we were
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
raised based on you know anything
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
hereditary and we don't understand that
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're making
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
complicating um decisions for our
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
children now we understand and we've had
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
trauma in form care we've had we heard
 
03:39:32.110 --> 03:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
earlier about a scores we understand how
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
different childhood factors affect our
 
03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
futures and that's why our committee is
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
so important and what we do on this bill
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
is so important because it shapes the
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
future of our community the children
 
03:39:47.469 --> 03:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
that we have that we can protect today
 
03:39:49.229 --> 03:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
are the children that will be our future
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
doctors our future scientists our future
 
03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
sanitation workers our future nurses
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's no end to that they are our
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
future and their protection is of the
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
utmost important now in this in
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislatively we have all agreed that
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
the home is the best place to keep kids
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
this is also not about removing children
 
03:40:12.269 --> 03:40:12.279 align:start position:0%
from the home this is about figuring out
 
03:40:14.910 --> 03:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
how to get Services before we have
 
03:40:14.920 --> 03:40:16.429 align:start position:0%
how to get Services before we have
crisis

03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
there have been so many testimonies I
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
have looked at DC the DCF workers in the
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
eye and questioned them quite fiercely
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
about why they're missing some certain
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
areas well when you look remember we
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
talked about that root part of it right
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
that Foundation when you look at the
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
standard that they are held to
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
currently we're holding them to a
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
standard without it without them having
 
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
the tools in their toolbox to be able to
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
do something a major crisis has to
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
almost happen before they can really do
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
anything and they're not coming in to
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
arrest people and further do that
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get services to people
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
because I guarantee you there are
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
parents that don't understand that even
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
though their their father and their
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
grandfather or their mother and their
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
grandmother did things that's not the
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
best practice now there are better ways
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
to do it we also have a generation of
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
kids that maybe have access and
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
understanding to things that we not have
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes it takes somebody to
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
come in and help us with that this is
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
about helping Granite State families to
 
03:41:28.189 --> 03:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
remain a family to raise children in a
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
healthy manner that will help
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
them parenting is one of the most
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
important things we can do I actually
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
believe that our children are unone to
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
us and that our job is to guide them to
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
get them to that next step the child
 
03:41:45.309 --> 03:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
protection act is incredibly important
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and amending this
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
and updating the language to fit today's
 
03:41:54.670 --> 03:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
needs is imperative we cannot continue
 
03:41:56.830 --> 03:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
to let our children fall through the
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
cracks of a crumbling Foundation it is
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
time for us to take this Foundation
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
build it so then we can build off of
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
that but we need to have these
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
definitions updated will this fix all of
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
it oh no it's going to be that bowl of
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
pasta I talked about earlier and there's
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
going to be more but at least we have a
 
03:42:19.229 --> 03:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
solid foundation to start with um there
 
03:42:21.149 --> 03:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
are experts here that are going to talk
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
really specifically about each piece of
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
the language in this I'm happy to answer
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
any questions but I think when it comes
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
to specific I will let them handle it
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
because they're in the trenches working
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
this where we'll still kind of like
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
observing all of it so thank
 
03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative representative Raymond
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um my question is
 
03:42:49.389 --> 03:42:49.399 align:start position:0%
actually for you sir can we ask about
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment at this time or only the
 
03:42:54.189 --> 03:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill chair makes the ruling
 
03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
that you may ask about the amendment
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you can you speak to um what the
 
03:43:02.590 --> 03:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment changes from the original and
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
why it's important well originally the
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
language that we had and I kind of
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
touched on that earlier was a particular
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
way and um let me see let me get this
 
03:43:14.910 --> 03:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
out here there were some specific things
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
left left out and specifically that we
 
03:43:19.469 --> 03:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
left out that were added
 
03:43:21.910 --> 03:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think that the office of the
 
03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
child advocate would actually be better
 
03:43:25.469 --> 03:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
to explain this but I do know that there
 
03:43:27.550 --> 03:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
was one part that continued to flag that
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
actually um I believe she's here today
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative biman called me and said
 
03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
this says in Udo and I'm like I don't
 
03:43:35.349 --> 03:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
remember in utero anywhere in there and
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
then I went back and looked to see what
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
OS gave me and magically those two words
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
were in there so um that's something
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we did take out there's some
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
complicating things uh commas are
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
everything you'll see that there are
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
some commas changed because it
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
completely changes the meaning of of
 
03:43:52.349 --> 03:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
that but I think that um the OCA will be
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer all of those
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions because they're pretty uh
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
they're technical but it changes the
 
03:43:57.359 --> 03:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
they're technical but it changes the
entire

03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
entire
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'll wait for OCS okay representative
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
taking my questions um in multiple
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
places here um we are using the using
 
03:44:15.229 --> 03:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
the terms emotional and psychological um
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
abuse and stuff and that how was that
 
03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
measured I think that would better be
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
explained by some experts but I do know
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
from my own personal experience with
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
emotional and psychological that's not
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with your kids um that
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
certainly we do disagree with our kids
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to disagree with our kids
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
even though my teenager would like to
 
03:44:38.590 --> 03:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
think differently um it's about whenever
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
it it goes beyond that and it goes to
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
belittling it goes to damaging behavior
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
and so there are certainly a lot of
 
03:44:48.030 --> 03:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
studies and stuff and I know that uh DCF
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
and OCA can probably talk and there
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
might even be a couple doctors that can
 
03:44:52.950 --> 03:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
talk more to
 
03:44:55.870 --> 03:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
that follow up Mr chair I have uh I have
 
03:44:57.630 --> 03:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
multiple questions on this uh would it
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
I let's do a few of them the most
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
important ones okay um the uh let's see
 
03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
where am I are we talking about the
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill both okay okay uh
 
03:45:14.590 --> 03:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
we use the the terms preponderance of
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
the evidence of the evidence uh standard
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
rather than Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
Beyond a reasonable Doubt's been uh the
 
03:45:23.149 --> 03:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
standard that courts have used for for
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
so not in as far as I understand not in
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
civil cases in criminal yes there is a
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
difference within civil cases um abuse
 
03:45:33.550 --> 03:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
can be very hard to um Define and
 
03:45:35.469 --> 03:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
certainly it's not always as clearcut
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
for every uh person that I've talked to
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that has been a survivor of domestic
 
03:45:41.469 --> 03:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
violence their counterpart has also
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
claimed abuse so it's it's one of those
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
things that you're not going to have um
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
that level of care and if we waited for
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
that level of care we'd have a lot more
 
03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the situation that um the kiddos that
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
I listed I would like to ask for a uh
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
comment from attorney marel one of our
 
03:46:01.630 --> 03:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh as a definition of
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
preponderance a one- sentence definition
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
is it more than 50% of the evidence
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh preponderance of the evidence
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
standard is simply more likely than not
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
get the ball over the net thank you you
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
know the Judiciary he wants me to go to
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
law school you know yeah okay
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll let somebody else ask and I'll
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
find the other things up that's that's
 
03:46:34.349 --> 03:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh have you found one of them can you
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
wing it yes I have um good right at the
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
very beginning of the amendment uh it
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
talks about abandonment of the child for
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
how long what what are the age uh
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
structures for this um you know it's
 
03:46:51.149 --> 03:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
different to leave a a a 2-year-old than
 
03:46:52.990 --> 03:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
it is a 12-year-old uh letting the
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
12-year-old go play ball down behind the
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
school uh shouldn't be abandonment and
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
the way this is written it certainly
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
could be well absolutely and I think
 
03:47:03.550 --> 03:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
that I will once again refer to the OCA
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to that's a very specific um language
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
piece that was worked on by Senator
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
Carson and that committee along with
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
them so I'll let her I'll let uh the OCA
 
03:47:11.159 --> 03:47:12.990 align:start position:0%
them so I'll let her I'll let uh the OCA
answer

03:47:12.990 --> 03:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything else for representative Greg
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%

03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester um good afternoon and thank
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak today in
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill uh my name is
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Brian fluming I'm with the
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department I'm the
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
sergeant in the juvenile unit um and we
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
handle the cases of child abuse neglect
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
and among other cases um for the past
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
seven of my 19-year career I've been
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
handling juvenile Cas related cases and
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
I believe anything that
 
03:48:17.790 --> 03:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
will further the safety of children in
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do as a state is a
 
03:48:21.239 --> 03:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do as a state is a
benefit

03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:48:28.590 --> 03:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I just prepared some uh notes here um
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
the bill takes important steps to
 
03:48:32.189 --> 03:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
address the complex issues of child
 
03:48:34.510 --> 03:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect by expanding the
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
definitions to include um crucial
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of a child's well-being such as
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
emotional and psychological harm
 
03:48:44.189 --> 03:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
previously these often invisible forms
 
03:48:45.990 --> 03:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
of abuse were difficult to address
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
within the legal framework but this bill
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
ensures these children will receive the
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
same protection as those that are
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
suffering from physical abuse because
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
often times you can see the physical
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
abuse obviously but you might not know
 
03:49:01.229 --> 03:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
or be able to see necessarily
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
psychological and emotional
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
abuse um I also believe this bill will
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
help to give DCF the ability to get
 
03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
Services into place earlier to hopefully
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
prevent anything from ever reaching the
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
criminal level where police involvement
 
03:49:15.870 --> 03:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
becomes necessary I totally agree with
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
the statements that were just previously
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
said as far as keeping the family
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
together trying to support the family as
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
best as we can and we would rather see
 
03:49:27.309 --> 03:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
as a police department the services that
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
are available out there through DCF and
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
other agencies help the families prior
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
to it reaching a police level or
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation so anything that
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
we can do to get early intervention into
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
these families into the with these
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
children to prevent anybody from getting
 
03:49:46.349 --> 03:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
in trouble criminally uh we fully
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
support um the introduction of the
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
reputable presumption of harm is another
 
03:49:51.159 --> 03:49:52.189 align:start position:0%
reputable presumption of harm is another
significant

03:49:52.189 --> 03:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:49:54.510 --> 03:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement um this provision recognizes
 
03:49:56.189 --> 03:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
the inherent danger to children when
 
03:49:58.149 --> 03:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to prevent parental
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
substance misuse impaired driving
 
03:50:02.750 --> 03:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in the home or
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a serious unexplained injury
 
03:50:06.510 --> 03:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
of a young child or
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
infant um by Shifting the burden of the
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility I'm Sorry by Shifting the
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
burden to the responsible party to
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the child's safety is not
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
compromise we or the other agencies out
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
there can intervene earlier and
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
potentially prevent any further harm to
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
the child um this bill also enlists a
 
03:50:26.189 --> 03:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
trauma informed approach throughout the
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
child protection system while
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that the primary determinant
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
in these cases this the safety welfare
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
and best interest of the
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
child um this means doing whatever is
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep the kid safe and
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing the profound impact of
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
trauma on children and responding in
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
ways to help promote their healing and
 
03:50:46.349 --> 03:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
resilience because the ultimate goal is
 
03:50:48.189 --> 03:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure these children feel safe
 
03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
and that they can grow
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
up feeling safe and become productive
 
03:50:54.030 --> 03:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
members of society and be able to work
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
through whatever trauma they've had to
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.269 --> 03:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
lives this bill also provides DCF with
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
clearer definition stronger legal
 
03:51:06.309 --> 03:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
backing and a mandate for the
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care ultimately leading
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
to a more to more effective
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
interventions and support for Children
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
and Families adding the specific
 
03:51:16.710 --> 03:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
language um that's in there including
 
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
the psychological and emotional abuse um
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond just the term safety allows us to
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
be more clear as to what the child can
 
03:51:26.830 --> 03:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
be protected under in my experiences
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
I've encountered numerous cases where
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
earlier intervention and a more
 
03:51:33.149 --> 03:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive understanding of abuse and
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
neglect could have made a significant
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
difference in the child's life but steps
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
weren't taken prior due to nothing being
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
in place to possibly protect that child
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
this bill provides the necessary
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
framework to prevent serious crimes and
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
ensures that all children have the
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
thrive off is it officer or uh Sergeant
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
Sergeant um thank you for coming while
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
we can imagine cases where intervention
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
did not happen in a timely way can you
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
speak to the frequency of when sincere
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
but misguided intervention took place in
 
03:52:14.670 --> 03:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
other words uh the the family was was
 
03:52:16.590 --> 03:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
put into a situation because of a
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
complaint that was not warranted and
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
there was harm done could you speak to
 
03:52:22.110 --> 03:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
Sergeant are you I just want to make
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
sure I have the question where Services
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
were put into place but they weren't
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily needed due the due to the no
 
03:52:33.950 --> 03:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
I mean aggressive intervention in a
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
family that was wrong to have happened I
 
03:52:41.070 --> 03:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't necessarily know if I
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
could speak to that specifically as far
 
03:52:45.389 --> 03:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
as like the inhome services and that
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff is what I'm trying to say
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
is have Agents come in like Gang Busters
 
03:52:53.429 --> 03:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
into a family and uprooted and made
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
everybody cry and come to find out they
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
never should have done that have you
 
03:52:59.830 --> 03:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
experiences of that
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
secondhand I personally have not I can't
 
03:53:04.349 --> 03:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
say that it's never happened that
 
03:53:06.030 --> 03:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
because I I wouldn't know off hand but I
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
have never been involved with a
 
03:53:11.070 --> 03:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
situation such as that so is it true to
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
say that that scenario
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
is significantly dwarfed to the scenario
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
of intervention should have been done
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't in my opinion
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you any other questions for
 
03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:29.630 align:start position:0%
yes thank you any other questions for
the

03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
sergeant okay seeing none thank you and
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service Sergeant
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
today Mr chairman I do have one I'm
 
03:53:41.349 --> 03:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
sorry okay he hadn't left yet so go for
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
no I saw him start to get up and then it
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
occurred to me thank thank you for
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
indulging me and and thank you for
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
sitting back down um have there been um
 
03:53:53.309 --> 03:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
cases where the police were able to act
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
before DCF that you've experienced yes
 
03:53:56.720 --> 03:53:58.590 align:start position:0%
before DCF that you've experienced yes
um

03:53:58.590 --> 03:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
in without getting into specifics we we
 
03:54:04.990 --> 03:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
have responded to a call prior to DCF or
 
03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
it came in through the police department
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
and we've encountered situations where
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
we've had to take the children but then
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
obviously we immediately call D DF and
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
they respond so there has been times
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
where we've gone out and acted prior to
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
DCF being notified okay follow up for
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
clarification have you had any cases
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
where the police have felt that a family
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
needs intervention to protect children
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
who were uh at risk of harm where DCF
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
was unable to enact um an intervention
 
03:54:40.590 --> 03:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
because of the way the current
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
definitions work I don't believe so I
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
mean we've we've safety planned children
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
but we've always reached out to DCF to
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
get guidance and reach and they're very
 
03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
quick to respond with us so if we've had
 
03:54:58.189 --> 03:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
to intervene like that that they're
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
always either responding or following up
 
03:55:02.670 --> 03:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
the next day okay or they're a part of
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
the safety plan that we're enacting
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
because we have to we typically let them
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
know if we're removing a child or
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that okay thank
 
03:55:15.229 --> 03:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
you last call
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Sergeant thank you here's what
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do there were numbers of
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
technical questions asked of the bills
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor and she said that she
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
would defer to some people who could
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
give technical answers I'm going to call
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
on those people first then I'm going to
 
03:55:37.870 --> 03:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
call on any active state representatives
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
we have that is usual protocol and then
 
03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to deal with a whole stack of
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
pink cards I'm going to tell you ahead
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
of time anybody at that point will have
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
four minutes to
 
03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
testify and as I said at a previous
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
hearing you can get a lot in four
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
minutes so if you have a script you may
 
03:55:58.590 --> 03:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
want to cut out some things that is
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary verbiage the best speech I
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
ever heard in this committee was 47
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
seconds long it was on point it made the
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
points well it answered a possible
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
objection 47 seconds we paid attention
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that anybody in this room
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
starts losing interest in the middle of
 
03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
a long speech because I don't think I
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to say that so if you have
 
03:56:26.189 --> 03:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
something prepared I want to hear it but
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be four minutes so with
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
that in mind I'd first like to call up
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh to provide answers to technical
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions that we've had um Cassandra
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again and for the
 
03:56:54.189 --> 03:56:54.199 align:start position:0%
record Cassandra Sanchez child advocate
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and your
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
faithful sidekick attorney Lisa masio
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
Lisa masio the associate child advocate
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
we do have written testimony that we are
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
sharing with you today um I will not
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
drown on and on about that um but I do
 
03:57:10.590 --> 03:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
want to share in immediate response to
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of the questions asked um in
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
particularly the first question
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
from representative Raymond um yes we
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
have seen cases in which DCF was unable
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
to act when they wanted to um we did
 
03:57:25.389 --> 03:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
some work with the field administrators
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
at DCF um a little over a year ago and
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
they sent us over 30 case examples where
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
they filed in court and the judge did
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
not uphold their finding therefore they
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
were unable to continue to service that
 
03:57:40.149 --> 03:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
family and work with that family when
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
they truly felt those children were in
 
03:57:44.149 --> 03:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
danger we learned of these concern
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
concerns because the field in DCF came
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
to the office of the child advocate and
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
asked for our help and said we don't
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
know what to do we are really worried
 
03:57:56.309 --> 03:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
about these children but the courts are
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying we don't have enough how can we
 
03:58:01.110 --> 03:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
protect these children they do offer
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary cases which they did in in
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
these instances and the majority of
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
those cases the families did not choose
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
to take because they did not want to
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
work with the agency I think it's very
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
important to highlight what
 
03:58:13.870 --> 03:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative Greg had shared with us
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
that often times many families aren't
 
03:58:17.550 --> 03:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
ready or aren't even aware that the
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are happening in the home
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
are unsafe to their children and so if
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
there's no willingness to take a service
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
how do we help them learn and grow so
 
03:58:28.269 --> 03:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
that something detrimental does not
 
03:58:29.950 --> 03:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
happen down the line that truly will
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
tear that family apart as mentioned it
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
is very critical in all of this that we
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
focus on maintaining families together
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
however whenever possible we as a state
 
03:58:42.670 --> 03:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
have put a lot of attention and effort
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
into building out a children's of care
 
03:58:46.349 --> 03:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
so that there are community- Based
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
Services able to to Ser as families as
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to Children needing to be
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
removed from the home to receive those
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
Services we have a very well wellb built
 
03:58:59.149 --> 03:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
out children's system of care of course
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
we need to continue to fund this because
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
it is highly utilized right now in our
 
03:59:04.510 --> 03:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
state but what that tells us is that our
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
families are benefiting from what has
 
03:59:09.550 --> 03:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
been built but there are still families
 
03:59:11.269 --> 03:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
who are slipping through the cracks and
 
03:59:13.389 --> 03:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
that is what we are hoping that this
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
change in Lang anguage will catch these
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
is is not to bring in new families
 
03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
involved with the division but this is
 
03:59:20.349 --> 03:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
to service the very families that they
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
are already involved with they are
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
already receiving calls about they are
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
already assessing these families often
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
times time and time again because they
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
may not have enough the first time and a
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
couple of months later they get another
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
call couple of months later another call
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
may come in it may be a year but then
 
03:59:38.670 --> 03:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
there is another call these are not new
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
families these are repeat families that
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
truly do need assistance and help but
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
again may not be aware of how to do that
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
and often times aren't aware of what is
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
out there in the community to seek it
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
out on their own so they need guidance
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
from a professional to show them what
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
can help their family and where they can
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
be down the road if they do take that
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
help it's also important to acknowledge
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill um as was said quite a bit
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is 45 years old there has been a lot
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
of psychological research that has
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
happened in that time frame a large
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
focus on Aces um if anybody's familiar
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
with this adverse childhood experience
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
is what we learn from adverse childhood
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
experiences the more of them that a
 
04:00:21.389 --> 04:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
child has exposure to the more
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
likelihood they have of future health
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
issues down the road so we're not just
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
talking about mental health concerns
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
down the road although that is
 
04:00:30.550 --> 04:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely a component of this but we're
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about physical health outcomes
 
04:00:34.990 --> 04:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
that are negative and there in
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
scientific research told us that but we
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily have enough
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
information then there's a lot more work
 
04:00:43.469 --> 04:00:43.479 align:start position:0%
done around trauma and understanding how
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
trauma impacts people throughout their
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
lifespan how trauma that happens as a
 
04:00:49.149 --> 04:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
young child doesn't just live in your
 
04:00:50.910 --> 04:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
childhood it follows you through the TR
 
04:00:52.349 --> 04:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
trajectory of the rest of your life and
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
has a great impact on what you can do in
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
the future and by bringing this statue
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
into the current day and time to the
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
psychological research that really
 
04:01:03.149 --> 04:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
touches on the importance of
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
psychological impact and Trauma to
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
children we can hopefully prevent some
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
of this and and truly that is the key it
 
04:01:11.630 --> 04:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
is prevention work that it's going to
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
take to reduce these negative out out
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
comes we need to get into families early
 
04:01:18.429 --> 04:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
on as we heard the sergeant just share
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's really important to have that early
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
intervention and by allowing the
 
04:01:25.710 --> 04:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
division to file petitions based on
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse get into a household
 
04:01:31.229 --> 04:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
teach those parents educate them
 
04:01:32.990 --> 04:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's a one-time occurrence
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
that they need to touch that system and
 
04:01:36.269 --> 04:01:36.279 align:start position:0%
they will never come back again because
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
they've learned from that but if we
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't allow that opportunity these
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
families do come back and back until
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
something terrible happens
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it's again this is for the entire
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
family unit the abuse of a child impacts
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
everybody around them particularly their
 
04:01:54.269 --> 04:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
parents that we know care deeply about
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
them and want to see positive outcomes
 
04:01:59.149 --> 04:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
yes there are some very horrific cases
 
04:02:00.830 --> 04:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen with parents who did not have
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
great intentions for their children but
 
04:02:04.269 --> 04:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
we know that is not most parents and we
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
know most parents are are truly fighting
 
04:02:08.189 --> 04:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
to provide all that they can for their
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
children but we live in a very complex
 
04:02:12.149 --> 04:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
world right now tensions are are high
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
generally for adults and so that
 
04:02:16.149 --> 04:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
complicates life for children as well we
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
are seeing children with higher rates of
 
04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
mental health diagnosis we are seeing
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
children higher rates of suicide um
 
04:02:25.389 --> 04:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
suicide right now is the number two
 
04:02:27.309 --> 04:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
cause of death in children 10 to 14
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
years old that is extremely young we
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
need our children they are our next
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Generation um and so it is important
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
that we added in as well the um
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
definition of trauma-informed care uh
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
because what that means is that means
 
04:02:43.510 --> 04:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's a system that's paying attention to
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
the trauma aware of it and responding to
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
people that way many parents who are
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
touching the system have also had their
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
own trauma we know generational trauma
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
is what leads many families into this
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
system and so having having trauma
 
04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
informed Care at the heart of the work
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
that the agency does but now when
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're intervening and working with the
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
family they're not just looking at the
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
family and pointing a finger and saying
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
parent you're doing something wrong
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
they're saying we know you've been
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
through something let's figure out how
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
to get your entire family unit to a
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
better place and so we did work very
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
very hard to make sure that we found
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
thorough trauma-informed definitions
 
04:03:19.630 --> 04:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
that came from psychologically backed
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
resources such as the national child
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
traumatic stress Network and absap ABAC
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
which is the American professional
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
Society on the abuse of children um two
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
very highly regarded National
 
04:03:32.910 --> 04:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um and that so that is
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
where the definition in this bill came
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
from um you may have heard us as well um
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
speak in in this committee and other
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
committees in the past around a system
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
review mapping that we had um we had
 
04:03:49.469 --> 04:03:49.479 align:start position:0%
held in the summer of 2023 and this
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
mapping was in regards to nine
 
04:03:54.990 --> 04:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
non-ambulatory infants that presented to
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
EDS with multiple broken bones over a
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
4-month period that is a lot in a short
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
amount of time these children helped
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
inform multiple sections throughout
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.870 --> 04:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk for a minute about
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
the process of this bill as you know uh
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
last session uh representative Greg
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it was s SP 459 which was
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson's Bill we had worked on
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
it for some time with the oversight
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
Commission on children's services she
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
had asked to retain it as a study
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee because there were some
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
discussions she wanted to have uh so I
 
04:04:37.510 --> 04:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
did also pass around um for your guys
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
information the study committee report
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
and attached to it is the language that
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
senator Carson put forth and provided to
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Greg as the language that
 
04:04:50.630 --> 04:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
that committee had arrived at and
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon was on that
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee um and that language has been
 
04:04:58.750 --> 04:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
agreed upon between the offic of child
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
advocate the oversight commission um
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
input that committee's input and dcyf
 
04:05:07.469 --> 04:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
which was really important and was not
 
04:05:09.870 --> 04:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
quite as clear with s459 there had been
 
04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
some turnover in DCF so this was really
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
a collaborative process we sat at the
 
04:05:18.429 --> 04:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
table with attorney larabie with Deputy
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh Ross with director Marie Nunan and
 
04:05:23.670 --> 04:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
this language you have in front of you
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
with the amendment because there were
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
some errors in the original bill that
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
are corrected by the amendment this is
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
the agreed upon language and if you read
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
all of the minutes of the eight meetings
 
04:05:38.189 --> 04:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
we had that were hours long each many of
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
these questions have been asked and
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon asked many of
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
them they really went through this bill
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
piece by piece and asked about every
 
04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
word um and there were sometimes lengthy
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
discussions about one word or one comma
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
um of why things were worded that way
 
04:05:56.590 --> 04:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
and those were discussions that were had
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
with us with other stakeholders in the
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
room with DCF uh Dr Amy Roy who you all
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with who have been here
 
04:06:05.149 --> 04:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
for a few years is now actually the
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
director of the cap program at Dartmouth
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock unfortunately she's at a
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
conference right now well probably
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately for her she's in San Diego
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
so I just go off phone with her though
 
04:06:16.510 --> 04:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
and she did sign in in support uh we
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
worked directly with her quite heavily
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
especially around the non-ambulatory
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
infant piece um Lieutenant Nicholas
 
04:06:27.550 --> 04:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
georgis from Manchester um he sent his
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
his able Sergeant here today he's also
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
at a conference um also worked heavily
 
04:06:35.070 --> 04:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
with us so um representative love I
 
04:06:36.750 --> 04:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your question because
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
this is a common
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
misperception 169c is a civil statute
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of the evidence has
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
always the standard in Civil Court
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is only used
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
in criminal proceedings the amendment
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
made in this bill is not a changed to
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
any law it's just a clarification
 
04:06:57.309 --> 04:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
because the law was vague before it just
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
said insufficient evidence what does
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
that mean so we added the correct
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence in there because
 
04:07:07.149 --> 04:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise it was very vague and unclear
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of the Amendments made here
 
04:07:12.750 --> 04:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
were the culmination of com
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with many experts with the
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
experts at dcyf but I can tell you that
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee the study committee with
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and Senator Whitley and
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon and
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative Robert hard was also on
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
it they asked incredibly detailed
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
questions um you know another section
 
04:07:32.990 --> 04:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point you to that
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
representative Greg alluded to is right
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
at the beginning um on page one line 20
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
an edit was made to presume that family
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
Unity is in the best interest of the
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
child it used to say to determine if
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
preservation was we know from research
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that preservation of the family unit is
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
in the best interest the purpose of this
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
bill and it um really aligns well with
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
sb47 from last session these were all
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
presented at the same time to maintain
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
that family Integrity but as other folks
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
have stated without the proper tools in
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
their belt without clear correct
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
thorough definition dcf's hands are
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes tied and it does escalate to a
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
point where the children do end up
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
having to get removed because this is
 
04:08:23.309 --> 04:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
the 10th investigation now something
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
really serious has happened whereas if
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
we're able to see those interventions
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
earlier not after five or 10 assessments
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
you can preserve the family unit by
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
putting services in place so um I can
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
tell you that every word of this has
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
probably been discussed at length but
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're here to answer those questions for
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
you of what that process was like and
 
04:08:47.309 --> 04:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
and one more addition that I I want to
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
point you to before we open it up two
 
04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
questions um that you will see a very
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
Stark um difference in the amendment and
 
04:08:57.109 --> 04:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
um the bill as introduced if you look
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
under neglect um in e um the as
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
introduced talks about exposure of a
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
child in utero um which was not the
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
intended language there um and now that
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
it has been fixed in the amendment um it
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
speaks to a child who is born substance
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
exposed um and what we found and our
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and through the research
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
as well is that it is really really
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
important to encourage mothers when they
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
are pregnant to seek care to seek all
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
prenatal care that they can receive and
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the way that had
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
previously been written it was not clear
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
that there are Protections in place for
 
04:09:43.109 --> 04:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
mothers who are in treatment who are
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
taking taking medications to remain
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
clean from illicit substances and it's
 
04:09:50.189 --> 04:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
really important that we encourage them
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
to do that so we worked to put language
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
in here that would ensure that when a
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
parent that it requires there to be more
 
04:10:03.389 --> 04:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
than just the substance exposure by the
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
child which means oftentimes a positive
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
test at Birth rather than just a
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
positive test at Birth to have that
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
family be involved with the agency there
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
also needs to to be harm to the child we
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
do not want the hospitals to be calling
 
04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
on every single parent who is trying to
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
do the right thing who is trying to stay
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
on their treatment plan we want to make
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
sure that there is truly a correlation
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
between their use and harm to the child
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
before the agency becomes involved so
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
that was a really important addition to
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
us and a way to help protect mothers and
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that they do seek out care
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
throughout their
 
04:10:41.469 --> 04:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we are now open to questions
 
04:10:41.479 --> 04:10:44.429 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we are now open to questions
questions

04:10:44.429 --> 04:10:44.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies for your uh your
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'd like to some
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
clarification on uh providing proper
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
supervision uh there's no no language
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
here for once again for for age
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
differences uh you know it's it's
 
04:11:02.830 --> 04:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
different to leave a a two-year-old at
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
the at the ballpack to play baseball
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
than it is a 12 12y old um you know
 
04:11:09.109 --> 04:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's no language here for
 
04:11:11.710 --> 04:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
that and uh I I have a friend that uh
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
that was was arrested for a for his
 
04:11:16.389 --> 04:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
8-year-old granddaughter who was sitting
 
04:11:18.109 --> 04:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
at the park with her and her and her
 
04:11:19.950 --> 04:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
brother and the kids are running around
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of them and the the
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
8-year-old girl went up and over the
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
hill and uh some kid found her she she
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
got lost you know she was less than 100
 
04:11:31.389 --> 04:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
yards away but uh he got arrested for
 
04:11:33.109 --> 04:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
that some kids started yelling and
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
screaming and call the cops and uh he
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
got arrested and you know had to go to
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
court and pay a lawyer and all that and
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know where's the definition of
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know age related um requ there is no
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
age um intentionally in this because
 
04:11:49.950 --> 04:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
developmental levels are drastically
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
different for each child so there could
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
be a child who is 10 years old who's
 
04:11:56.309 --> 04:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
very self-sufficient there could be a
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
child who is 17 years old and is at the
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
level of a 5-year-old developmentally so
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
by assigning an age to that that could
 
04:12:06.309 --> 04:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
become quite dangerous actually um
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
because often
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
times parents look at it like well if it
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
says here the age I'm going to follow
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
that to a te but if you're 1-year-old
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
truly is not safe to be home by
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
themselves then maybe we shouldn't be
 
04:12:18.910 --> 04:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
following that or maybe we shouldn't
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
even have that in there because it
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
becomes a dangerous area in which we're
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
holding the parents to something that
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
the law actually contradicts so it's
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
really important to make sure we do not
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
assign an age but it is important for
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
the agency to be very reasonable and so
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to to know the process
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
what happens when somebody sees a child
 
04:12:40.670 --> 04:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
and they think they're In Harm's Way
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
they pick up the phone and they call
 
04:12:44.109 --> 04:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
dcyf and they somebody on the other end
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
of the phone from their Central intake
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
to take that report that person on the
 
04:12:49.870 --> 04:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
other end of the phone who's taking in
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
this information is also looking at what
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect laws say oh you
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
got a 12-year-old they're by the park by
 
04:12:59.349 --> 04:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
themselves mom was like in her car
 
04:13:00.990 --> 04:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
getting something and came back that's
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
not going to screen in as abuse and
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
neglect to them they're going to say
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
sorry that's not us um we can guide you
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
to Community Resources if you're worried
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
about this family we can guide the
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
family to Community Resources but that's
 
04:13:13.109 --> 04:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
not us we are not going to invest
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
investigate that we are going to move on
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
from that and so it is important that
 
04:13:20.510 --> 04:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
there is that layer in between it is not
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
a call to DCF and somebody is
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
immediately knocking on your door there
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that in between of does this actually
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
meet the statute to say whether that is
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
something that they would open up DCF is
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the room so I would point to them um
 
04:13:36.269 --> 04:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
to answer that question more
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
specifically about you know what they
 
04:13:39.550 --> 04:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
think about when they're assessing for
 
04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
that um for a child who's left home
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
alone I can say AB is quite different um
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
abandonment is truly a parent leaves and
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
there is no parent there to care for the
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
child to sign school documents to sign
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
medical documents they don't they're not
 
04:13:57.630 --> 04:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
around that that is very different than
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
a young child a abandonment of even a
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
17-year-old is concerning because if
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
that child has a medical issue and they
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
need to seek care there's no Guardian to
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
sign off for that so abandonment is
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
separate from that issue but I do
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
believe dcif could speak better to when
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
they would screen those out versus when
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
they would
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
not followup is there any language that
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
you could recommend to bridge the the
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
difference right now no other than the
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
language that we have here um I again I
 
04:14:28.990 --> 04:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned about um adding too
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
much to the the definitions here to
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
really make it restrictive it does need
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
to be a bit more Broad and and a lot of
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
that additional work does come in DCF
 
04:14:39.630 --> 04:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
updating policies after the fact as well
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the OCA works very closely
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
with them that whenever a bill is passed
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that the policy aligns with
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and the intent
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
instances I have a question for
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
Council yes sir it may be a
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
caricature that whenever a bill dripping
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
with compassion comes people say oh
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's a Democrat thing well I can drip
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
too but that's not my
 
04:15:14.030 --> 04:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
point is it the case the four committee
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
members cited in this final report three
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
Republicans that is the case sir and
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe I'm not doing that to
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
to arh Horn I'm just trying to say that
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue would you
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
agree yes and Senator Carson has frankly
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
been one of The staunchest Advocates and
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
supporters of the office of child
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
advocate she's chaired the oversight
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
commission since its Inception and she
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
has been pushing for this update it was
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
actually the committee that requested a
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
definition of trauma informed care and
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
that vetted this current language um
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually believe it may have been
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon who requested it
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
because we we all say trauma informed
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
care as though everyone knows what that
 
04:15:59.950 --> 04:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
means um so that's where that definition
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
came from and and it has been a very
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
strongly bipartisan effort thank you
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
Council for taking my leading questions
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
anything else yes representative Coen
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chair I'll get
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman speaker soon thank you Mr
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh thank you for
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
being here to answer my question um I
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of questions about this bill
 
04:16:24.910 --> 04:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
um but the one I want to raise now is in
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
the neglect section um the one that you
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
had just read paragraph E when the child
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
is born alcohol or substance exposed
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
except when taking as prescribed or
 
04:16:37.389 --> 04:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
recommended and monitored by a licensed
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider and the newborn
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
child's health or welfare is threatened
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
by the use so the way you had just
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
explained it is you wouldn't step in
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
unless the child's health
 
04:16:53.950 --> 04:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
was was compromised because of the drug
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
use in
 
04:16:58.750 --> 04:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
utero um but from what I understand that
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
um luck of the draw um I've heard of
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
situations where you know two pregnant
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
women can do the same exact type of drug
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
and you'll have one baby born that's
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine
 
04:17:15.070 --> 04:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
and then you'll have another baby who
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
was born with all kinds of issues from
 
04:17:20.590 --> 04:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
the same exact drug use so why are we
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
out it's the importance of in in these
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
definitions it requires serious
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
impairment or harm to the child to be
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
able to file abuse and neglect in the
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
court to uphold that definition and so
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
realistically it it it is different
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
because where is the harm the harm is
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
not visible on infant a who mom
 
04:17:51.870 --> 04:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
potentially had been using the child did
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
not exhibit any symptoms child B who may
 
04:17:57.389 --> 04:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
have exhibited the symptoms now we have
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
harm and so it is important if we just
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
have these definitions that if you do
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
this to your
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
child the agency can intervene we're
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
talking about pulling in a lot of
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
families by the action it's how did that
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
action then directly harm the child and
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
so here we have made sure that there is
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
a tie back to harm to the child because
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
it is true and it is very strange we see
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
these often actually where we have cases
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
that have been called into DCF and one
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
child has absolutely no response to the
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
substance exposure and therefore they
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
close out but another family may not and
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
then they're servicing and working with
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
that family followup followup um so I'm
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
just I'm really comfortable letting one
 
04:18:46.590 --> 04:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
parent off the hook because you know
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
their Their little bodies took it in a
 
04:18:51.790 --> 04:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
different way than this little body but
 
04:18:54.750 --> 04:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
both of those infants are still at risk
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
yes and so when those risk factors are
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
in place the agency can offer a
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary case to the family they can
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
offer them services to learn oftentimes
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
we actually see a a large response from
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well sending home a a
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
VNA to continue to follow the child to
 
04:19:12.910 --> 04:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're thriving and
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
those are ones where typically if they
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
do come back they'd be coming back from
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician or a daycare provider
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
down the line um but again if we it's
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
really hard to tie it just to the
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
actions of the parent because we'd have
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
a lot more families involved in our
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
system and truly our child abuse and and
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
neglect statutes always tie back to how
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
child I have a question uh my wife is a
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
family practice physician and I've spent
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
50 years is in part doing counseling and
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
she says it's much easier to measure
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
physical problems than it is
 
04:19:52.269 --> 04:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
psychological problems and um she's
 
04:19:54.269 --> 04:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
right and I suggested her for
 
04:19:54.279 --> 04:19:56.109 align:start position:0%
right and I suggested her for
analysis

04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh how would we measure psychological
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
well-being it's quite difficult um to be
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
frank it is I acknowledge that um but
 
04:20:08.750 --> 04:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
realistically we see it start to impact
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
different areas of a child's life often
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at how they interact
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
with peers how they interact around
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
their family members um how they
 
04:20:19.950 --> 04:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
interact in a school setting and are
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
they struggling in different areas and
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um also a lot a lot of children these
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
days want to talk to people and so we
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
find that a lot of our children are
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
either seeking out a therapist or maybe
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
a school guidance counselor and they're
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
able to talk about their experiences and
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
how it's impacting them and that's how
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
we learn so much about that impact of
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
trauma is through people sharing their
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
experience so when children open up and
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
share that and they're telling somebody
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'm may be suicidal now because of
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
things that have been going on in my
 
04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
home that's going to flag for
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
particularly School folks if they're
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
told in that setting that's going to
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
flag for that school folk that something
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
is happening in that home and we likely
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
need to call it in and allow
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
professionals to assess that and then
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
the professionals also then go meet and
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with that child they
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
assess the whole family unit but then
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
they also separate that child and have a
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
conversation with them oneon-one and if
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
the child's saying I'm suffering with x
 
04:21:14.349 --> 04:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
Y and Z because of what's happening in
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
my family unit then we need to believe
 
04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
that to be true and we need to believe
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that to be a psychological impact would
 
04:21:22.429 --> 04:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
it be fair to say that there are certain
 
04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are consistent which
 
04:21:27.109 --> 04:21:27.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't prove it but it's consistent
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
Behavior to psychological abuse and that
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
various chapters in DSM and other places
 
04:21:36.269 --> 04:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
point us to what those behaviors are now
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's not 100% correspondence but it is
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
enough is it enough then to go forward
 
04:21:43.359 --> 04:21:44.349 align:start position:0%
enough is it enough then to go forward
with

04:21:44.349 --> 04:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
investigation yes um because what our
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
behaviors they another way the child
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
communicates to us not all children have
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
verbal communication we need to read
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
everything non-verbal communication
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
behaviors it's all a form of
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
communication so yes there are some very
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
specific behaviors that are tied to very
 
04:22:05.550 --> 04:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
serious issues such as um psychological
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
abuse there are very
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
specific um sorry sexual abuse they're
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
are very specific sexual reactive
 
04:22:11.960 --> 04:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
are very specific sexual reactive
Behavior

04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
that can be seen from children um that
 
04:22:18.670 --> 04:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
mirror child child can be somewhat
 
04:22:20.830 --> 04:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
different but are pretty common to
 
04:22:22.269 --> 04:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
happen in children and so that can tell
 
04:22:24.109 --> 04:22:24.119 align:start position:0%
us a lot but there are other behaviors
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
as well that um coupled with other
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
information through an assessment do
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
tell us the child needs more growing age
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
regressive behaviors for example
 
04:22:33.550 --> 04:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay counselor I just wanted
 
04:22:36.109 --> 04:22:36.119 align:start position:0%
to add from my experience I was both a
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
DCF attorney so kind of Prosecuting
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases in the Civil
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
courts as well as a parent attorney for
 
04:22:44.590 --> 04:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
quite some time so the flip side of of
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
sort of expanding that language to
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
include emotional psychological mental
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
well-being is a call will often come in
 
04:22:54.550 --> 04:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
with concrete indicators you know a
 
04:22:58.030 --> 04:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
child is coming to school dirty hungry
 
04:22:58.040 --> 04:22:59.109 align:start position:0%
child is coming to school dirty hungry
very

04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:23:02.309 --> 04:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
tired and when there is
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
investigation there might not be the
 
04:23:06.790 --> 04:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
physical indicators as sergeant Fleming
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned but there are a lot of
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
psychological indicators or well-being
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
indicators that that was sort of another
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
Gap that was being missed that children
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
are being exposed to trauma they are in
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
a neglectful situation but the way the
 
04:23:25.229 --> 04:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
law was written 45 years ago they
 
04:23:28.030 --> 04:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
weren't able to pursue and offer
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
services to that family unless there was
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
a indicator of their health or safety
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
versus all these psychological
 
04:23:38.750 --> 04:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
indicators which are often behavioral
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
indicators so it's also that flip side
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily someone calling in
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
of this child has a psychological
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
indicator it's more once you get in
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
there without that expansion of language
 
04:23:52.269 --> 04:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
to recognize all the impacts of trauma
 
04:23:55.349 --> 04:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
can sometimes be hard to pursue those
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
cases and they end up falling through
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
the crack and have multiple assessments
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
till things get really serious to a
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
child potentially being suicidal thank
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
question um one of the things that um
 
04:24:12.910 --> 04:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
someone said a minute ago was about um
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
letting parents off the hook and so I
 
04:24:19.109 --> 04:24:19.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about what does it mean to
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
have services are we catching parents
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
are we punishing parents like what is
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
the services what's the purpose and what
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
are what's the array like well thank you
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
that is that's a great question um
 
04:24:31.830 --> 04:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
really the services that are being
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
offered the services that that we as a
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
state have come behind are
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based services that show us
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
that they have positive outcomes and
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
most of those evidence-based Services
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
truly rely on the Family guiding the
 
04:24:46.030 --> 04:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
process the family has to buy into that
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
process um DCF intervention is them
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
coming to the house and checking in on
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
the house and checking in talking with
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
family members talking with a child but
 
04:24:58.710 --> 04:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
the actual services that can be put into
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
the home um like High Fidelity
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
wraparound um Services it's really
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
meeting with that family hearing their
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
story telling them how can we help you
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
get to a better place what are the goals
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
we really want to see for your family
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
and then when that family determines
 
04:25:16.590 --> 04:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
that they find others in the community
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
to help build around that family to be
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
their support system whether it be
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
natural supports or whether it be
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
professional supports and they're
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
building that at the family's Direction
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
often times it takes some time to get
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
there take some time to build that
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
Rapport but they are coming in with that
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
non-judgmental lens um it does feel more
 
04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
judgmental for families when DCF is
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and say I have this allegation
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
against you let's talk about that but
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
when we're actually talking about the
 
04:25:45.790 --> 04:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
services that can come in to assist
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
families they may have that information
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
but they're not showing up at a family's
 
04:25:51.630 --> 04:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
door with a piece of paper that says you
 
04:25:53.309 --> 04:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
did this to your child they're showing
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
up saying we're here to help how can we
 
04:25:54.880 --> 04:25:56.109 align:start position:0%
up saying we're here to help how can we
work

04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
together follow up thank you and are
 
04:26:02.189 --> 04:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
families able to access those Services
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
um without DCF opening a case and paying
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
for some of them there are few services
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
that are accessible in the community
 
04:26:12.429 --> 04:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
without the without DCF involvement um
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
We are continuing to try to move there
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a state but initially the way our
 
04:26:18.910 --> 04:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
system was built out was for those
 
04:26:20.910 --> 04:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
services to be offered through DCF and
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
so still to date DCF does have access to
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
additional Services especially high
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
intensity services so for children who
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
may really be struggling behaviorally um
 
04:26:32.189 --> 04:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
those services that can come to the
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
house three or four times a week those
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
are primarily offered through dcyf at
 
04:26:38.830 --> 04:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
this time and so there are still some
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
families that don't necessarily want to
 
04:26:41.790 --> 04:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
become State involved but they know
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
their child's struggling and they will
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
go to DCF asking for help because they
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
know that the services in the community
 
04:26:50.469 --> 04:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
cannot meet their level of need thank
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
Grossman thank you chairman Pearson um
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Office of the child advocate
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
for your always valued testimony
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
um how does this the amended version how
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
would it
 
04:27:12.269 --> 04:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
affect some of those babies that that
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
have come through ERS or with broken
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
bones and gone home would this change
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
the trajectory for some cases we
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
strongly believe it would um because of
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
the addition of some language
 
04:27:44.590 --> 04:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
um so page three on the bill as
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
introduced um if you look at C there it
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
talks about physical injury to a
 
04:27:55.950 --> 04:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
child and that really expanded on what
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
we had prior um it the the important
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
role there is the or indeterminate means
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
if the parent or Guardian parent
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
guardians or custodians are the primary
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
or sole caregivers and have offered no
 
04:28:09.109 --> 04:28:09.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable alternative explanations for
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
said injuries um unfortunately in the
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
many cases that we reviewed there was no
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
identified perpetrator and therefore
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
when the division filed petitions they
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
were not successful in abuse petitions
 
04:28:23.790 --> 04:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
because they did not have that
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
identified perpetrator but what they did
 
04:28:27.670 --> 04:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
know at that time is they did know that
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
the only caretakers for those children
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
were their biological parents and so
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
something happened in that household
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
between those two parents that harmed
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
the child but neither was willing to
 
04:28:40.510 --> 04:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
come forward and say that because then
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's criminal implications for that
 
04:28:41.840 --> 04:28:42.910 align:start position:0%
there's criminal implications for that
parent

04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
but what that then did was limit dcf's
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
ability to intervene and assist that
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
family so by this addition here that is
 
04:28:52.990 --> 04:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
now we don't need to have that
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
identified perpetrator to and um a a
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
perfect explanation as to what happened
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have that mapped out
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
situation of you know this is what they
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
said and this is law enforcement's um
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
rebuild of of the um incident they can
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
say we have not received enough
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
information and medical professionals
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
can say what was provided to us by
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
parents is not what could have caused
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
these injuries we do not have further
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
information but we can say that is not a
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable explanation so with medical
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
professionals being able to weigh in
 
04:29:28.030 --> 04:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
that way and then expanding it to
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
include the indeterminate means that
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
would capture the majority of those
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
children the other addition is under
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
serious impair serious
 
04:29:44.109 --> 04:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.790 --> 04:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
in L um with the addition of any single
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
incident or occurrence of serious injury
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
or illness that did not exist before and
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of a single incident is
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
that with these babies it was a single
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
incident there was I believe one that
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
returned to the Ed for a full SK
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
skeletal that did have additional broken
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
bones at that point that were identified
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
but all the others it was a single
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
incident that led to it and so we do not
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
want to rely on Old statue that requires
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
multiple incidents to occur because at
 
04:30:22.990 --> 04:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
that point the child may not make it to
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
that next medical visit and then the
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
final one is in the rebuttable
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm um on page
 
04:30:34.349 --> 04:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
nine v um evidence of serious injury
 
04:30:36.910 --> 04:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
broken bones or unexplained injuries to
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
any non-ambulatory child um this did
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to it because it had
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
broken bones in the plural um and we
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that one Broken Bone
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
Alone could be enough um to to show that
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
a child is In Harm's Way and so um that
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
is in the amendment they um provided
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
some parentheses around the S so it can
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
be broken bone or broken bones um but
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
those are all of the sections that do
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
issues thank you
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
OCA thank you very
 
04:31:13.399 --> 04:31:15.990 align:start position:0%
OCA thank you very
much

04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%

04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
information okay now you you're swapping
 
04:31:29.070 --> 04:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
seats from last time okay good thank you
 
04:31:33.070 --> 04:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
good and same thing um you are the ones
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
that were behind the presenter and are
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
there additional
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
explanations you might like to give
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
us if I could just start by saying again
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Susan laraby DCF general
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
counsel I think what gets very hard
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we look at bills and then
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
amendment of bills we're not looking at
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the complete one the complete chapter
 
04:32:04.109 --> 04:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
and here with
 
04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
169c it is a very complex and robust and
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
wordy chapter there are 40 subsections
 
04:32:14.109 --> 04:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
to this very important section uh
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
chapter and there should be 40
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
subsections but I think sometimes when
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
that happens we tend to only look at the
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill itself and not how it fits into the
 
04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
already established act so for instance
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
burden of proof that has come up a few
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
times now that has been in the statute
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
not just in civil actions alone but in
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
this specific statute 169 C13 burden of
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
proof the petitioner has the burden of
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
proof proof to allege to uh I'm sorry to
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
prove the allegations to in support of
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
of the petition by a perance of the
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that's already in Statue this
 
04:32:56.189 --> 04:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
bill does not change that this bill only
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
changes two very specific sections the
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
definitions but then the definitions
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
applied throughout the the act as well
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
as then the rebuttable presumptions of
 
04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
harm which are not until the very near
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
the end of the ACT because the
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harm does not
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
change the definitions of abuse and
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
neglect it is under the evidentiary SE
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
section of the Bill of the ACT to help
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
us prove what is harm what is serious
 
04:33:29.070 --> 04:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
impairment what is risk of serious
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
impairment and that's very difficult to
 
04:33:33.429 --> 04:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
do especially with
 
04:33:33.439 --> 04:33:35.109 align:start position:0%
do especially with
psychological

04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
abuse so I just want to put that into
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
context I think sometimes that's
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
overlooked nothing in this bill Bill
 
04:33:45.629 --> 04:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
changes the due process rights of
 
04:33:48.189 --> 04:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
parents and that's why there are 40
 
04:33:50.590 --> 04:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill that goes through
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
every step of the process from the
 
04:33:56.109 --> 04:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
initial call to Central intake to the
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not that
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
should be screened in for an
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
investigation for an assessment while we
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
are assessing and investigating whether
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
or not that has been abused whether or
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
not there has been abuse or neglect
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
remember we are the the division for
 
04:34:16.590 --> 04:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
children youth and families commonly
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
we're called division of and that little
 
04:34:20.349 --> 04:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
preposition I think it's called a
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
preposition in grammar of and for are
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
very important distinctions we are for
 
04:34:27.390 --> 04:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
youth we are for children we're for
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
families it's not adversarial sometimes
 
04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
it may seem adversarial when when it has
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
to get to court and we talked a little
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
bit about those cases that have to go to
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
court that we have to prove the elements
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect by a preponderance
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the evidence we're not changing that
 
04:34:48.910 --> 04:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill we're not changing the
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
due process rights of parents we're
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
trying again to enhance how we work with
 
04:34:58.349 --> 04:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
families deputy director rth can talk
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
more about that if necessary but again
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're working so hard towards that
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
prevention step working with them with
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
voluntary Services providing the
 
04:35:10.830 --> 04:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
services that they need to become the
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
parents that they want want to become so
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
I just want to sayate that again we're
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions you may
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
have about this bill or any practices
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%

DCF I I Echo um what attorney laraby has
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
to say um and we've talked about
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
services to family there are many ways
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
that families can access Services um and
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always have to be um a
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
petition of abuse and neglect or us
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
removing a child from their home to have
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
Services we have voluntary services that
 
04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
we can um you know provide referrals for
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
for families to access within their
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
communities we do have our paid services
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we can provide to families when we
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
do become involved um but the the um
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
ability our ability to um to um support
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%

04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
referring to when we started to talk
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
about the children who were um
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
experiencing significant injuries um but
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
yet were um not receiving the services
 
04:36:31.150 --> 04:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
they needed nor the families to help
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
understand how those injuries may have
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
occurred and then how to you know
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
support the family so those didn't
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
happen again so we do work
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with each other to talk
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
about how we can service families and
 
04:36:42.990 --> 04:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
children um and again our job is to you
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
know ultimately protect the kids um and
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that their safety um is protected
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
while in their family unit and working
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
with the family together so again happy
 
04:36:55.390 --> 04:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
to answer any practice questions any um
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
additional questions you might
 
04:36:59.789 --> 04:36:59.799 align:start position:0%
have is D of
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
cyf full strength or short
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
staff we um are always um hiring if
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to J um yeah we are um at
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
78 capacity 78% capacity in our
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
assessment um area of practice and we
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
are at about 90% of capacity at our
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
family service uh area of practice um so
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that one of the
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
reasons why sometimes something doesn't
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
get the attention it deserves is your
 
04:37:29.949 --> 04:37:29.959 align:start position:0%
staff's already working full Tilton
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
there's more cases potential cases than
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
there are staff workers yes we have been
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
fortunate over the past several years uh
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature has offered um the
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
ability for us to hire several new
 
04:37:44.590 --> 04:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
positions particularly in our assessment
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
phase um which is the initial phase of
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
work with families where we're
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
investigating the allegations of abuse
 
04:37:53.070 --> 04:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
and neglect and making determinations so
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have been able to um hire additional
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
staff in that area of practice which has
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
helped with the outcomes that families
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
are experiencing but also the turnover
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
for our staff we are seeing an increase
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
rise in case numbers because we are
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
offering more voluntary services to
 
04:38:09.869 --> 04:38:09.879 align:start position:0%
families and working with families
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
outside of court but through an open
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
case with the division so we are seeing
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
um the case numbers um case loads rise
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
in that area so um we are looking at how
 
04:38:23.230 --> 04:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
to um also support our family service
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
workers um yeah as well thank you yes
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Mel thank you
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for taking my question um
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you what you're providing here I
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
think is very valuable uh we were
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
earlier hearing talk about psychological
 
04:38:43.230 --> 04:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
harm um what Provisions in this bill or
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
what Provisions in the
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
DCF stable if you will allow for
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
clinical assessment of psychological
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
harm and what do you see for example as
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
the potential for uh diagnosis of
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
psychological harm and I'm going to also
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
include in that the the inherent risks
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
associated with a differential diagnosis
 
04:39:07.629 --> 04:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
if this is going to be done without
 
04:39:07.639 --> 04:39:10.349 align:start position:0%
if this is going to be done without
clinical

04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
assessment yeah so I can speak to the
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
practice side um our investigations are
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
done um with the family and it we also
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
rely on um information gathered from
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
other sources um and so we are talking
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
to as um the OCA um had represented we
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
are talking with schools we are talking
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
with medical professionals we are
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
talking with mental health professionals
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
and other individuals who might know the
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
family and be working with the family at
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the same time so our our job is to
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
gather as much information as we can
 
04:39:41.550 --> 04:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
about the child and the family and
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation to truly understand what might
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
be happening um we do have access to
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
evaluations um you know that we can
 
04:39:51.788 --> 04:39:51.798 align:start position:0%
provide parents and children and youth
 
04:39:54.550 --> 04:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
um both at the investigation phase as
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
well as at the case phase um and so
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
certainly understanding we do have a
 
04:40:01.150 --> 04:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
variety of providers that we work with
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
that are informed of our practice our
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
system trauma in in trauma informed as
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
well um and so we do work with multitude
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
of of different agencies to help with
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
those um evaluations and assessments to
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
help us understand truly what might be
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
happening okay so if you have follow up
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you Mr chairman for a
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
followup yeah so for a followup um if
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
any of these matters do end up in court
 
04:40:28.150 --> 04:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
for some reason so in other words you're
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
saying that if I hear you correctly you
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
have the actual expertise on staff these
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
people will be able to um be able to
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
make those kinds of clinical assessments
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
we do not have them on staff we have
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
them as providers that we um contract
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
with or you certify um to work with us
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
um and we can provide families referrals
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
to them or we can use whatever Community
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
partner that the family might be
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable using as well um so it
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily need to be a
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
provider that we have certified um we
 
04:41:01.470 --> 04:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
can access providers you know throughout
 
04:41:03.390 --> 04:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
the the um community that the family
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
might live in um and so yes we do that
 
04:41:08.670 --> 04:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
does become sort of evidentiary if you
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
will within our hearings and our
 
04:41:12.270 --> 04:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um it becom Discovery so
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
everything we collect during the course
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
of our investigation or even our case is
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
discoverable and is provided um to all
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
parties in the matter um and then we do
 
04:41:23.470 --> 04:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
rely on you know Witnesses fact
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses to come in and talk about that
 
04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
we're social workers we know we are not
 
04:41:28.270 --> 04:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
MediCal providers we know we are not
 
04:41:30.270 --> 04:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers we can't make
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
those type of diagnoses so we do rely on
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
the experts um to help us form an
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
opinion okay thank you very

time working with moms babies and
 
04:43:40.230 --> 04:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
families in several capacities inpatient
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
outpatient Health Tech I've worked uh
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
significantly with moms suffering from
 
04:43:48.030 --> 04:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
maternal substance use and their infants
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
both prenatally and postpartum I've
 
04:43:52.030 --> 04:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
cared for those babies that you were
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
asking about representative coren um and
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen both sides of that in in my
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
own care um my main area of expertise is
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
actually maternal mental health and I am
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
certified in that through the only
 
04:44:07.868 --> 04:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
certifying organization in the country
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
um there are several pieces of language
 
04:44:12.350 --> 04:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
that concern here and I will say with
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's been a little hard
 
04:44:16.110 --> 04:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
for me to know off the bat this morning
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
what's still in there and what isn't um
 
04:44:21.390 --> 04:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
but given that there are several
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
different pieces of it it is something
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
that I don't think is solved easily with
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
a few word changes and one of the
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
reasons um that I have that concern is
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
that defining substance use in and of
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
itself in any way as neglect or abuse um
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
is not how we would define it it
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
clinically so we really need to separate
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
the difference between having a mental
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
health condition which substance use is
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
and actual harm that it does to the
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
child so there are others who will speak
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
to that in more depth but what is widely
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
accepted in the space of perinatal
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
exposure is that fear of a referral to
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
DCF significantly decreases engagement
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
in both recovery programs and prenatal
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
care and substance use is a clinical
 
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
condition that should be addressed with
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
protocols that are developed by clinical
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
experts it's really important for me to
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
call out right now that per the
 
04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
CDC perinatal mental health is the
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
number one cause of pregnancy related
 
04:45:32.430 --> 04:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
deaths right now when taking into
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
account suicide and overdose and so from
 
04:45:39.390 --> 04:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
this perspective let me go to my next
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
page um what I like to emphasize is that
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
while well- intended we know that this
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
bill is very likely to decrease maternal
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
engagement in recovery programs as well
 
04:45:54.270 --> 04:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
as prenatal care and thus the bill
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
increases the risk for increased
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths in New Hampshire the
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
reason is that be regardless of what we
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
know we we might have talked about well
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
what will happen after they're referred
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
to DCF and it might be great the problem
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
is that regardless of we what we know
 
04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
folks who are most vulnerable who have
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
been targeted before and I think some of
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
us know we support dcyf and we know
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's rooms for improvement folks who
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
have been targeted are often from more
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
vulnerable groups including those with
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
substance use concerns and so those
 
04:46:38.430 --> 04:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
folks have a higher fear of the system
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we know is going to
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
happen they have a fear and I want to
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
share just a quick little anecdote um
 
04:46:46.350 --> 04:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
this is a personal experience it's an
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
anecdote but the scenario is completely
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
backed up with evidence as some other
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
folks will attest to um I do trainings I
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
train folks in the clinical field how to
 
04:46:59.390 --> 04:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
deliver perinatal mental health
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
screeners so screeners that will help us
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
find folks that have perinatal or
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
maternal depression or anxiety um a few
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I was training somebody now
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
this person is a clinical person
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
she happens to be a single mom she said
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
to us I personally would not take this
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
or would answer
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
incorrectly because of fear that if I
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
fail it which you can't fail a screener
 
04:47:28.590 --> 04:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
but her words over and over if I fail it
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
dcyf will take my kids this is a health
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
care provider in the space of helping
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
moms and babies and that is what we're
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with that perception is out
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
there and when word gets out that there
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
are higher um that they'll get more
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
attention for it or that there could be
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
more referrals we are going to see fewer
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
people accessing the care that they need
 
04:47:54.190 --> 04:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
summary um I do respectfully request
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
that we vote itl on this bill in the
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
hopes that we can bring in additional
 
04:48:04.110 --> 04:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
clinical experts I think that on this
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
side we didn't have enough of the
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
maternal um substance use uh uh uh input
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
here and I I know there's a lot of us
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
who would really like to help craft some
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the wording so that would it be in
 
04:48:18.270 --> 04:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
alignment with what we know to be best
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
clinical practice for moms and babies
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative today yes is
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing yes and if you have
 
04:48:28.868 --> 04:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
additional experts or whatevers they're
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
here who are not here oh yes uh they can
 
04:48:34.590 --> 04:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
certainly speak with the prime sponsor
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
if the prime sponsor is willing
 
04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
wonderful are you willing to take
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't see any wow well either I
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
did a really bad job or I answered all
 
04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:49.910 align:start position:0%
did a really bad job or I answered all
the

04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:51.868 --> 04:48:51.878 align:start position:0%
questions welcome to the House of
 
04:48:53.708 --> 04:48:53.718 align:start position:0%

and remember we're on our four minute
 
04:49:16.638 --> 04:49:17.868 align:start position:0%
and remember we're on our four minute
thingy

04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
thingy
 
04:49:21.070 --> 04:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
here good afternoon Representatives my
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
name is JMA Wilder and I'm from Campton
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I oppose House Bill 553 my
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is the vague and
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguous language that it would allow
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
for unconstitutional abuse of power I
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
came here today not only for the
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
protection of precious children but for
 
04:49:42.548 --> 04:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
the generation to come adding in
 
04:49:44.708 --> 04:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
language such as emotional mental
 
04:49:47.070 --> 04:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
behavioral and psychological needs and
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
Welfare allows for children and parents
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
to come under attack without having a
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
standard for
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
measure there are times when my children
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand the importance of
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
lessons such as sharing serving reading
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
math history caring for others and
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes proper hygiene when a child
 
04:50:10.270 --> 04:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
becomes frustrated with these things
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
it's job as parents to help them see the
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
importance of it I have worked with many
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
children over the years and have had
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
Untold complaints about doing things
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that were hard for them but helped them
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
grow and learn necessary physical mental
 
04:50:28.030 --> 04:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
and spiritual lessons over the last two
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
decades the emotional psychological and
 
04:50:33.030 --> 04:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
me mental well-being of children has
 
04:50:35.548 --> 04:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
rapidly been on the decline there has
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
been a rise in suicide and decline in
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
mental health since doctor School
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
counselors and other organizations have
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
put so much focus on it when are we
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to consider some of the adults
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
having conversations with children are
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
causing more harm than good exposing
 
04:50:57.070 --> 04:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
children to explicit questions about
 
04:51:00.750 --> 04:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
body image sex drugs and suicide when
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
they have never even considered it plant
 
04:51:06.910 --> 04:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
seeds and causes harmful thoughts when I
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
brought one of my children to the
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
doctors they were given a survey and
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
many of the questions had to do with
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
body image after we left the doctors we
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
talked about the visit and sadly my CH
 
04:51:19.708 --> 04:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
my child shared that they had never
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
thought about their body image until the
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
doctor asked the seed was planted and
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
grew I spent years trying to make
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
something that came from a survey
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
claiming to help
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
children I I'm sorry I spent years
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
trying to undo something that claimed
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
from a survey claiming to help children
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is too Broad and allows for
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
Family Court to circumvent due process
 
04:51:47.150 --> 04:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
without proving guilt it will also
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
include many cost uh major costs and
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
resources in a system that is already
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
taxed I ask that you reconsider this and
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%

job chair recognizes uh Matthew Hassel

it's a double barrel first name and I
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
can't quite read the other half of it
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
in thought this is for Representatives
 
04:52:34.270 --> 04:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
right now you're gonna have to sit down
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the microphone so I can hear you I
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
thought this was for Representatives
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
right now I'm sorry I thought thought
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
this section was for representative they
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
have finished
 
04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I'm in opposition of
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
and you got four minutes starting now
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
itl I'm going to get right to the legal
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
principle of the state action Doctrine
 
04:52:53.280 --> 04:52:55.548 align:start position:0%
principle of the state action Doctrine
which

04:52:55.548 --> 04:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
exactly I'm going to get right to the
 
04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
legal principle of the state action
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
Doctrine which is exactly what this bill
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
is State action this state action
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
Doctrine is a legal principle that
 
04:53:05.310 --> 04:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
limits the application of constitutional
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
rights to actions taken by the state or
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
its agents it protects the people from
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
action Tak by the government that
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
violate their constitutional right the
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
doctrine arise to all levels of
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
government including federal state and
 
04:53:19.470 --> 04:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
local it prevents the government from
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly depriving people
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
of their constitutional right it also
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
prevents the state from becoming
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
significantly involved in the actions of
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
private individuals making those actions
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
the same as state actions the doctrine
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
is used to determine whether a claim
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
based on the Constitution is valid the
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
first three words of the second sentence
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the 14th Amendment are no state shall
 
04:53:43.390 --> 04:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
this sentence declares that the states
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
may not abridge the privileges and
 
04:53:46.590 --> 04:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
immunities of the people of the United
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
States or deprive people of life liberty
 
04:53:50.548 --> 04:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
or property without due process of law
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
nor deny to any of the people the equal
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
protections of the law as recently
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
decided in the Supreme Court of the
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
United States in Christopher l Wilson
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
versus Hawaii on December 9th of 2024
 
04:54:03.230 --> 04:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
Americans need not engage in empty
 
04:54:04.830 --> 04:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
formalities before they can evoke their
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights as Wilson versus
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hawaii states we people do not have to
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
engage in the empty formalities of the
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
state before we invoke our
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights by enacting this
 
04:54:17.788 --> 04:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
bill as state standing law and procedure
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
the governing body and its agents will
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
have failed to give the state and
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
federal constitutions its due regards
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
when this happens the government reduces
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
such rights to a second class of
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
protection and guarantees these
 
04:54:29.868 --> 04:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights are not a second
 
04:54:31.230 --> 04:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
class of protections and guarantees
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
subject to an entirely different body of
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
rules than the other bills of Rights the
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
state or its agents and agencies do not
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
have the right to inflict wrongs upon
 
04:54:42.270 --> 04:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
the Free People by denial the full
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
protections of the law such as due
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
process of law within the meaning of the
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
fifth and 14th Amendment equal
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
protection under the law within the
 
04:54:50.548 --> 04:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
meaning of the 14th Amendment and the
 
04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
sixth and seventh amendment protection
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
to a jur trial which is what this bill
 
04:54:56.430 --> 04:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
presents because all state officials
 
04:54:58.270 --> 04:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
including yourselves are by the
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution to be required to be bound
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
by oath or affirmation to support the
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution the 14th Amendment of the
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution has vested in the Congress
 
04:55:07.948 --> 04:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
of the United States the power by proper
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to prevent any state from
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
depriving any of the people of the
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
United States of the enjoyment of life
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
liberty and property the Constitutions
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
can by law provide against all such
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
abuses and denials of Rights by the
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
state and by state actors or
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
combinations of per persons or
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
corporations such as those who enact
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and those tasked with
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement for conspiracy deprivation
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
of rights under the color of law this
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill as proposal will warrant a finding
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
of unconstitutional State action
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
triggering the state action Doctrine in
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
a federal court as of this day I am l
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
litigating in the first Court First
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court of Appeals on an ongoing
 
04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
Tor action against three state actors
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
for violations to the Constitution and
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
statutes just like this that case is
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
Hassel versus kimar case number 24-44
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
I depending on how that case is decided
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
will be further taken action to the
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court which is
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
protected by the First Amendment to
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
redress for grievances this bill is
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
opening the state and its agent and its
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
agencies to further Tor claims and
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional State action if this
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill is enacted which if passed as
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
proposed will be added to my case in the
 
04:56:16.830 --> 04:56:16.840 align:start position:0%

questions thank you and the chair
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
where thank you Mr chairman members of
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:58:06.270 --> 04:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
Leah kushman I live in the town of wear
 
04:58:08.350 --> 04:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a former state representative and I
 
04:58:10.590 --> 04:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
am on the board of rebuild New Hampshire
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
and uh part of an organization called
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
assembly of New Hampshire people called
 
04:58:16.110 --> 04:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Family
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
Justice um a lot of great points were
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
made in the last testimony um and your
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
question at the end sir um just to tie
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
it in and explain how this is
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um a little bit
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
further SEC versus jesi it was a court
 
04:58:38.990 --> 04:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
case where it was a civil action by the
 
04:58:39.000 --> 04:58:40.548 align:start position:0%
case where it was a civil action by the
state

04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
by the federal agency the uh Securities
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
and Exchange Commission against a fellow
 
04:58:47.948 --> 04:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
named JY for fraud and the court found
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
that if a suit is in the nature of an
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
action at common law then the matter
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
presumptively concerns private rights
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
and an adjudication by an article three
 
04:58:59.628 --> 04:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
or a common law court is
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
mandatory in essence due process rights
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
must be honored when the action is
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
similar to an action that at the
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
founding would have been um
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that due
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
process Family
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
Court treats abuse and neglect like
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
civil cases when that makes it so that
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're being um we're not being tough on
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
crime we're being lenient on crime
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
because it takes hearing after hearing
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
to get anything done and in the meantime
 
04:59:37.708 --> 04:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
the child stays with parents unless you
 
04:59:39.510 --> 04:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
have the EXP parte which is sometimes
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
used but
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
um requires a lot more um threshold of
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
evidence so DCF is blaming the
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
court the courts blame DCF and others
 
04:59:53.760 --> 04:59:57.788 align:start position:0%
court the courts blame DCF and others
but

04:59:57.788 --> 04:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
um DCF screening and the process there
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
is a big part of the problem every other
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
crime you have a complaint and then it's
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
given by someone in a police report or
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
an affidavit then they have liability if
 
05:00:18.788 --> 05:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's wrong um if they they knowingly
 
05:00:22.270 --> 05:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
gave false information and then that
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
gives them jurisdiction to move into
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
investigatory phase or get a warrant for
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
surveillance or search so they can go in
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
and obtain the evidence needed to get a
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
child safe immediately whereas DCF
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
requir uh Ries with the child protection
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
act on voluntary cooperation in most
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
cases so it gives people time to hide a
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
child to move a child um and this only
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
started back in the 80s prior to that um
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
these these were treated as crimes with
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
the full investigatory power of law
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the protections of due
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
process in a criminal court which is
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
very specific um so the soft on crime
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
approach is letting kids fall through
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
the cracks because they don't meet the
 
05:01:11.310 --> 05:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
screening threshold and DCF basically
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
can make arbitrary decisions to not
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
follow up or if they don't make contact
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
with a parent they don't um they don't
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
follow up we saw that happen with
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
Harmony Montgomery um so to say that
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to use this process before
 
05:01:27.670 --> 05:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
you go to a criminal procedure it's
 
05:01:27.680 --> 05:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
you go to a criminal procedure it's
backwards

05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
this if this bill cited simply that
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
abuse was defined as a CH a conviction
 
05:01:43.150 --> 05:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
of 20 seconds of of one of the um
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes concerning abuse you
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
know endangerment of the welfare of a
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
child uh sexual assault um battery
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and required that
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
before proceeding that would be fine
 
05:01:57.070 --> 05:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
because that would be how it it used to
 
05:01:59.548 --> 05:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
be up until the mid 20th century there
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
was criminal and civil and then there
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
was Equity time's up any questions for
 
05:02:12.590 --> 05:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.600 --> 05:02:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you Mr
 
05:02:21.390 --> 05:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here um
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
my question is are you saying that you
 
05:02:26.430 --> 05:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
believe that within DCF parents are
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
giving way too
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
child I'm saying that we're not
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
following a consistent process there
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room for
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um arbitrary decision makak and they are
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
not trained law enforcement and from
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
time Memorial the common law and
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
criminal procedure in the United States
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
since its Inception has provided
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
consistent um you know guardrails for
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
how Crim crimes are investigated and
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
pursued and because they are treated
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
differently and there's a lot of wiggle
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
room for um discretion that yes
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes it goes in the favor of
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
someone who's hiding abuse of a child
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it goes in the favor of
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
DCF agents who are a little too zealous
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
and have maybe their own um personal
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
biases and are investigating you know
 
05:03:27.070 --> 05:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
more zealously or you know targeting
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
someone based on their own
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
perceptions follow up oh sorry oh thank
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
else thank you for coming
 
05:03:40.920 --> 05:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
else thank you for coming

05:03:55.548 --> 05:03:55.558 align:start position:0%

redress list the Constitutional things

05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
dcyf is a um creature of the legislature
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
and operating under legislature and not
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%

a place for her and her children to stay
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
thus leaving the children without
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate shelter for the evening
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
based on the foregoing there is
 
05:06:18.990 --> 05:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause to believe that the
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
children are in circumstances or
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
surroundings that present an imminent
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
risk to his or her life that the necess
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
that necessitate immediate out of home
 
05:06:28.548 --> 05:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
placement the children are without
 
05:06:31.030 --> 05:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
proper parental care or control or other
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
care or control necessary for the
 
05:06:33.910 --> 05:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
physical mental or emotional health and
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
their health is very likely to suffer
 
05:06:38.190 --> 05:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
serious impairment based on forego there
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
is reasonable cause to believe that the
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
situation in the home is contrary to the
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
welfare of the above referenced children
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances expart relief is
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
the only relief available for the
 
05:06:49.628 --> 05:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
division I heard a lot of people say up
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
here that their main thing is to keep
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the children in the home and that's the
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
first thing that they do but with this
 
05:06:57.548 --> 05:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
with this expert fails to say is that my
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
children were with my older son I have
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
two older children one's 24 and one's 29
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
and my children were with my oldest one
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
of my oldest children um
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
DCF to not not DCF my experience my I
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
had my parental rights terminated 16
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
years ago to my three middle children
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
because I didn't have suitable housing
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
so here I am again I don't have suitable
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
housing and you remove my children even
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
though that's doesn't that doesn't
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
constitute neglect although I was they
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
did the judge signed off on this just
 
05:07:31.270 --> 05:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
because I didn't inform them of where I
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
would be staying with my children as if
 
05:07:35.708 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
that's any of their business DCF has
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
enough power and that they abuse right
 
05:07:40.350 --> 05:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
now as it is for us to add on all this
 
05:07:42.548 --> 05:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
extra language to this bill to give them
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
more power to you to abuse because as it
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
is right now they don't follow their
 
05:07:48.510 --> 05:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
protocols and they don't follow this law
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
because this expart should have never
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
been filed number one 15 seconds number
 
05:07:53.470 --> 05:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
two and I object to that four minutes
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
because the stakeholders that really
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
don't have anything at stake up here but
 
05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
we heard quite a bit from them so I
 
05:08:00.030 --> 05:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
would like my time as long as it takes
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
for me to
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
speak okay this petition for redress
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
where do you expect to send this who's
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to receive it and consider it turn
 
05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
your mic back on this is for all of you
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%

redress that the issues with DCF and
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to help to do
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
that and you're saying that DCF has I'm
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
reading it now no authority to interfere
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
with the liberty interest of the people
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
correct they are part they are A
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
legislature creature that running under
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislative laws which are not
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional fundamental
 
05:08:39.070 --> 05:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional New Hampshire which I
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
wrote the the articles on there that are
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
that are corresponding to the
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution to the fundamental rights
 
05:08:46.350 --> 05:08:46.360 align:start position:0%

thanks for having me my name is Farah
 
05:09:59.948 --> 05:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
Shen I'm a representative uh um
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative sorry I'm a resident of
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
Amur New Hampshire not a representative
 
05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
yet but maybe I'll do that someday why
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
um so my my uh written testimon is much
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
longer than what I'll share here but I
 
05:10:14.910 --> 05:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you had you
 
05:10:16.230 --> 05:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
know more of the details and some
 
05:10:19.230 --> 05:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
resources and uh my qualifications for
 
05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
why I can share what I can share um so I
 
05:10:25.470 --> 05:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
strongly agree that changes are needed
 
05:10:25.480 --> 05:10:26.390 align:start position:0%
strongly agree that changes are needed
to

05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:28.708 --> 05:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
169c uh I'm a registered nurse I'm a
 
05:10:30.190 --> 05:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
master's prepared registered nurse I've
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
been in the field for 30 years caring uh
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the Maternal Child Health realm um
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
especially with families affected by
 
05:10:40.708 --> 05:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and Trauma
 
05:10:43.150 --> 05:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
so I know we need changes but I oppose
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as written now and I believe
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
that changes as written in this bill
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
will contribute to the harm of Children
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
and Families in New
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mostly what I do right now is
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
I work with Maternal Child Health teams
 
05:10:57.788 --> 05:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
and state quality improvement groups
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
across the country and specifically
 
05:11:01.628 --> 05:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
representative Corin work with those
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
families who are dealing with the
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
complexities of substance use in utero
 
05:11:08.830 --> 05:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
and then the consequences of that for
 
05:11:10.510 --> 05:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
themselves their and their
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
infants um there's a model of care
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
called Eat Sleep console that New
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was actually the first state
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
in the nation to implement this model of
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
care in all of our at the time 16 birth
 
05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I was a leader in that
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
initiative and that education there's
 
05:11:28.030 --> 05:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
now been research done on the eat sleep
 
05:11:30.270 --> 05:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
console model of care um funded by the
 
05:11:32.548 --> 05:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
NIH by the N National Institute of
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
Health and um basically every state in
 
05:11:38.110 --> 05:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
the nation is saying please come help us
 
05:11:39.868 --> 05:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
come help our teams
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
um implement this model of care and it
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses you know your
 
05:11:45.070 --> 05:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
concerns so I can speak to that at the
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
end if I have
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
time um the language in the bill that's
 
05:11:51.310 --> 05:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
the most concerning to me that I want to
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
speak to is the presumption of harm as
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
related to substance use so I'm not
 
05:11:56.910 --> 05:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
going to read it because it's there and
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
you can read that but this is really not
 
05:12:02.350 --> 05:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
a trauma-informed section of the bill
 
05:12:04.230 --> 05:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's not trauma-informed language it's
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
not a trauma-informed
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
approach um and it's not a
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed way to protect families
 
05:12:09.920 --> 05:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed way to protect families
and

05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
children so I'm going to say something
 
05:12:17.708 --> 05:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
that might sound contrary to everything
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
you've believed in your entire life but
 
05:12:22.750 --> 05:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
it is the truth when it comes to science
 
05:12:22.760 --> 05:12:24.948 align:start position:0%
it is the truth when it comes to science
and

05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:28.830 --> 05:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
research substance use by a parent does
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
not equate to child
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
harm it
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't a parent who has a chronic
 
05:12:40.270 --> 05:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
medical condition in any other way like
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
diabetes maternal
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
obesity um uh and even other risk
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
factors like poverty or homelessness as
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
we just heard doesn't equate to child
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
abuse and
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
neglect is it a risk factor you bet is
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
it one of the most important risk
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
factors that our society needs to deal
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
with you bet does it actually equate to
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
child abuse and
 
05:13:05.878 --> 05:13:07.510 align:start position:0%
child abuse and
neglect

05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
no so one example of this is the
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
American Academy of breastfeeding
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
medicine which is our gold standard on
 
05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
who should be getting mother's milk how
 
05:13:20.670 --> 05:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
to get Mother's Milk you know what
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
should we do for encouragement and
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions and all that that
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
organization says if a parent if a
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
mother is nursing her child and she's
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with substance use or she's
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
using substances this is not a reason to
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
let me say that again if a parent is
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
using substances in their breastfeeding
 
05:13:47.548 --> 05:13:47.558 align:start position:0%
the highest level of Oran in
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
organization in our society who looks at
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and makes determinations
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
with all of the experts across the
 
05:13:57.868 --> 05:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
country does not equate it to child
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect they do not say you
 
05:13:59.360 --> 05:14:00.270 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect they do not say you
can't

05:14:00.270 --> 05:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
breastfeed they say how do we help you
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
mitigate the harm how do we help you get
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
support how do we assure that your child
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
's outcome is as best as it can be given
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
the situation of your health your
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
chronic disease and your family that
 
05:14:17.708 --> 05:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
might mean a mother is continuing to use
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding this is what is actually
 
05:14:24.270 --> 05:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
happening in healthcare because that's
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
the science behind the best practice 20
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
seconds so we need to really look at
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and make some changes we do
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't we absolutely have to make
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
sure that we're taking out the
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
stigmatization and the Discrimination
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
around substance use we would never say
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm based on poverty
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
lack of housing maternal diabetes we
 
05:14:50.190 --> 05:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
would never say presumption of harm
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
based on Parental trauma because that's
 
05:14:56.190 --> 05:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
one of the risk factors so we should not
 
05:14:58.350 --> 05:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
exclude or or like specifically pull in
 
05:15:01.868 --> 05:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
one group of people because a certain
 
05:15:06.670 --> 05:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
syndrome got to put it back put it back
 
05:15:13.600 --> 05:15:14.510 align:start position:0%
syndrome got to put it back put it back
on

05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
sorry uh yeah so that's a a complex
 
05:15:20.670 --> 05:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
issue right like there are situations
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
when when children have long-term
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
consequences however it is proven that
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
not all substance use leads to long-term
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
developmental outcomes and and and harm
 
05:15:33.510 --> 05:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
in fact um neonatal opioid withdrawal
 
05:15:37.150 --> 05:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
symptom is often a temporary condition
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
not a long-term chronic disease that a
 
05:15:42.030 --> 05:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
child experiences as a result of
 
05:15:44.190 --> 05:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
maternal substance use it's temporary
 
05:15:46.270 --> 05:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
and how do we deal with that is we make
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
sure the baby is with the mother and has
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
cuddling and has has breast milk and is
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
in a low stimulated environment and you
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
know lots of other ways to deal with the
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
temporary medic medical condition it's
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
not a long-term consequence in all cases
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
so in some some cases it is and that's
 
05:16:04.948 --> 05:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
what we really need to be looking at is
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
what is the actual harm to the child
 
05:16:11.230 --> 05:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.868 --> 05:16:13.878 align:start position:0%
representative rice thank you Mr
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question so I
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
have to ask you because I think
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
everybody here at this table has heard
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
the stories of children who have gotten
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
to their parents drugs and are dead
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
death is long term so how do you propose
 
05:16:32.670 --> 05:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
then that we protect these children from
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
that without this language being in this
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill just like we do with any other
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
child who could be at risk for anything
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
right so I have family members who use
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
farm equipment and Machinery they need
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their children don't
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
get into that and get hurt if they're
 
05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
not if they're not protecting their
 
05:16:55.150 --> 05:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
children from the situation that they're
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
in in their home then that's unsafe but
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
that could be across the board that
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
could be for someone who's taking you
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
know prescription medication for their
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
mental health care we can't say oh you
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
have a mental health condition and
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
there's drugs in your home to take care
 
05:17:11.310 --> 05:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
of you therefore we're going to you know
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
a presumption of harm and make sure that
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
your child you know is involved with DCF
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
we say what is the actual Behavior
 
05:17:20.110 --> 05:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's putting the child at risk not the
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
condition or the disease or the things
 
05:17:23.948 --> 05:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
we're using to help the person you know
 
05:17:23.958 --> 05:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
we're using to help the person you know
be

05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
well follow follow up thank you Mr
 
05:17:28.600 --> 05:17:31.948 align:start position:0%
well follow follow up thank you Mr
chairman

05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
so I can't wrap my head around this
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
canot because um I have heard stories of
 
05:17:42.628 --> 05:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
of children who who are dead because
 
05:17:45.470 --> 05:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
they they got into their parents
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
fenel you're your mental health
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
medication comes with a childproof
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
lid okay Sentinel you're buying off the
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
street does not and I just really feel
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
that that that makes no sense no sense
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
to me because we're going to end up with
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more dead children and I I can't
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
be a part of that can I respond yes
 
05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the written testimony I
 
05:18:13.948 --> 05:18:13.958 align:start position:0%
don't have time to talk about excuse me
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that um one of the problems is that
 
05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
engagement as Paige discussed engagement
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
with the system when families are
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
struggling and so my belief and actually
 
05:18:26.548 --> 05:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
what um evidence shows is that when
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
families actually can engage and they're
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
not afraid then it leads to better
 
05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes for children less D and less
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality and morbidity so it's
 
05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually I know that it's hard to wrap
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
your head around because this is
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
something that we have all been born
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
into in our culture that substance use
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
means bad person substance use means I'm
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to be unsafe and it actually
 
05:18:49.510 --> 05:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't sometimes it does sometimes
 
05:18:52.470 --> 05:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
having a farm is unsafe sometimes being
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
homeless is unsafe but not across the
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
board we can't just blanket it as one
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
group of people it's discriminatory and
 
05:19:01.788 --> 05:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
it's actually not
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
accurate repres be great
 
05:19:06.670 --> 05:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
but D
 
05:19:09.310 --> 05:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%

05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
a nurse correct yeah I am follow up
 
05:19:14.400 --> 05:19:15.230 align:start position:0%
a nurse correct yeah I am follow up
follow

05:19:15.230 --> 05:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
up um and you talked a little bit about
 
05:19:24.110 --> 05:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh the nursing mother who may be um
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
involved or addicted to drugs correct
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes followup
 
05:19:35.070 --> 05:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
followup so um failure to
 
05:19:37.470 --> 05:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
thrive is a very
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
important uh
 
05:19:44.548 --> 05:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
um condition for an infant and can cause
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
lifelong effects and is that correct it
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
is thank you okay so in the case of a
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
mother who is a cocaine addict comes
 
05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
into an emergency room the baby has
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
failure to thrive because the baby can't
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
suckle because in the milk is cocaine
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
would you say that would be a
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect of the drug addict
 
05:20:07.760 --> 05:20:09.990 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect of the drug addict
mother

05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
mother
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
first of all fail failure to thrive is a
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
very complex uh condition that is
 
05:20:14.400 --> 05:20:17.470 align:start position:0%
very complex uh condition that is
usually

05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
multifactorial um and so when there's a
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
situation where there's a parent using
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
substances and that's affecting their
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
overall ability to be able to care for
 
05:20:29.230 --> 05:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
their child then does does an
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
intervention need to happen yes I'm not
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
saying that that shouldn't happen I'm
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying that blanket substance use as
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm should not be part
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
of our our our code you know our our
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
statute thank you for your testimony
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%

05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
child I want to really know because I
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
didn't how can we protect a child in a
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
situation where parental parents are
 
05:21:21.548 --> 05:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
using substances in an unsafe way is
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
that your question to me yeah
 
05:21:28.990 --> 05:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
well it's um we need lots and lots of
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
ways to do that you know we need
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
resources for housing so that parents
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
aren't unhoused we need more funds for
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
mental healthare and substance use you
 
05:21:42.110 --> 05:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
know what we need New Hampshire we need
 
05:21:44.350 --> 05:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
a residential treatment center where
 
05:21:46.110 --> 05:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
moms and babies can be cared for
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
together and not separated we need
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
foster homes that are willing to take in
 
05:21:54.030 --> 05:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
mothers and infants together um we need
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
trauma informed educated Workforce
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
across social medical and you know
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
Educational Services and systems I mean
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
I could go on I could probably write a
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
book and maybe I will but um there's
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
lots of things that we need but to
 
05:22:14.310 --> 05:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
stigmatize one group of people and and
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
call them out in this legislation um and
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
in the in the existing 169c that we
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
safe any other
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:22:31.628 --> 05:22:31.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for listening chair
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
recognizes Randall
 
05:22:51.548 --> 05:22:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative um chair
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
and representatives um kind of against
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um there's been a lot of
 
05:23:04.110 --> 05:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
fallacies um spoken here today
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
um title 42 um is a public health and
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
warfare it's a non-positive law title um
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like these agencies the
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch State agencies um
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're obviously not following due
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
process and if these statutes are
 
05:23:25.708 --> 05:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
actually going into Circuit Court
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
um and we and before someone was talking
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
about uh preponderance of the evidence
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
and difference between criminal and
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
statues uh and civil sanctions and
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um so if we're talking about
 
05:23:38.000 --> 05:23:39.190 align:start position:0%
whatever um so if we're talking about
civil

05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
civil
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
um the Fourth Amendment of the
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution says probable cause can't
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
come from civil disputes so
 
05:23:48.990 --> 05:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
um judge Garner was in here and he said
 
05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
that um Rules of Evidence don't apply
 
05:23:52.510 --> 05:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
what they want to be as a gatekeeper for
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
Reliable information judge Gardner wrote
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
in my odor that Rules of Evidence do not
 
05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
apply and um Rules of Evidence do not
 
05:24:02.430 --> 05:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
apply to the orders I seek to vacate so
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes in Family Court
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
without evidence and he denied the
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
motion to vacate the protective order um
 
05:24:09.628 --> 05:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
sir we're going to ask you to address
 
05:24:11.310 --> 05:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
the bill it sounds like you're
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
addressing a law case I'm addressing the
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional actions of these
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
statutes in Circuit Court where evidence
 
05:24:22.270 --> 05:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply which means it's not a
 
05:24:25.470 --> 05:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
fair court and has does apply the Rules
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
of Evidence are different I've read that
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
book several times all right well you
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
may continue and I'm not penalizing you
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
for my speaking go
 
05:24:34.990 --> 05:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
ahead what do you have that says Rules
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
of Evidence do apply because I have it
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
in writing from the from the executive
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
administrator Garder um that Rules of
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
Evidence do not
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
apply so let's time out and try and
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
figure this out because now we have a
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
contrast and any ambiguity in any law
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
always favors the defendant
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
so um I got a lot more to say but the
 
05:25:00.510 --> 05:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
circuit courts uh administrative law
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
courts can't hear uh constitutional
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
claims that's why they take our kids
 
05:25:08.670 --> 05:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
away um kidnapping page stalking uh
 
05:25:10.750 --> 05:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
extortion you name it that's what they
 
05:25:13.628 --> 05:25:13.638 align:start position:0%
do so I'm against this bill because
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
nothing in it is is going to change I
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
like the constitutionality of it but
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
it's an unconstitutional court so to
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
having constitutionally verbiage in the
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't make it
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional so I haven't seen my kid
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
in six hours and 12 years because of New
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Family Court Michael Gardner
 
05:25:35.190 --> 05:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
so we do not mention names
 
05:25:37.948 --> 05:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
sir well he's retired so we do not
 
05:25:37.958 --> 05:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
sir well he's retired so we do not
mention

05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
mention
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
names so you're saying that Rules of
 
05:25:42.990 --> 05:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
Evidence do apply and I have it in
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
writing that they don't so I'm not I did
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
not say that continue you did say that
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
if I did can I have a recording from the
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
record anybody no you may not yeah then
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
let me clarify the The Rules of Evidence
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
apply in the discretion of the
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
judge well no that that's illegal you
 
05:26:08.590 --> 05:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
can't do that you don't have discretion
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
on the evidence either the evidence is
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
there and if it is there of a crime then
 
05:26:15.910 --> 05:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
you get transferred to a superior court
 
05:26:15.920 --> 05:26:16.868 align:start position:0%
you get transferred to a superior court
for

05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh okay you've got 30
 
05:26:21.030 --> 05:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
seconds left to tell us why we shouldn't
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
05:26:26.350 --> 05:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill because it's
 
05:26:26.360 --> 05:26:27.868 align:start position:0%
bill because it's
unconstitutional

05:26:27.868 --> 05:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
this committee will eventually vote on
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
this bill based on this bill and any
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
05:26:53.070 --> 05:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality is not our place to
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
decide I believe it has been decided it
 
05:26:58.510 --> 05:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps will be red decided but that's
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
not what we're doing here today when we
 
05:27:04.830 --> 05:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
exec we will exec on this bill if we
 
05:27:06.910 --> 05:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill or a bad Bill the
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
presumption is
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
this bill may be put forward others it
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
is their job to rule whether this is
 
05:27:18.868 --> 05:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional or not that's not us
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes um Courtney tan from
 
05:27:22.638 --> 05:27:28.830 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes um Courtney tan from
Dartmouth

05:27:28.830 --> 05:27:28.840 align:start position:0%

all for your thoughtful consideration
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health is home to um a number
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
of programs that I'm proud to be to
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
represent a couple of which are the
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
Northern New England perinat quality
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
improvement Network we also are home to
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
the um State's only child advocacy
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
Protection Program and we actually have
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
partner organizations across the state
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
one of which was mentioned here today we
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a partner program in at a hospital
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and it sounds like that
 
05:28:23.868 --> 05:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
provider was maybe involved in the
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
drafting of this but for the record
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
darou Health was not involved in the
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
drafting of this um Bill we do have some
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
concerns as an institution with the bill
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
particularly around um I'm looking at
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment now on the first page
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
lines 27 um there is a reference to
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
being born uh alcohol or substance
 
05:28:48.670 --> 05:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
exposed and so um have some concerns
 
05:28:51.868 --> 05:28:51.878 align:start position:0%
around how that's implemented how that's
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
defined um that you've heard testimony
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
today about how there are um clinical
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
best practices around children who have
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
been exposed to substances in utero um
 
05:29:07.548 --> 05:29:07.558 align:start position:0%
and uh we I don't want to repeat that
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
that test for the committee but just
 
05:29:11.230 --> 05:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
want to underscore um some of the
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that you've heard from uh from
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
a nurse just two testifiers ago so we um
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
I want to underscore that we are deeply
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
committed to the safety of infants that
 
05:29:23.070 --> 05:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
are born in the state to Children um but
 
05:29:24.430 --> 05:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
do have some concerns about the
 
05:29:26.670 --> 05:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
amendment as drafted we would be happy
 
05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee on the
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um but but we do have some
 
05:29:32.190 --> 05:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
concerns I also have written testimony
 
05:29:33.868 --> 05:29:33.878 align:start position:0%
that I will send to the committee it's
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
in a PDF form and I will email it to you
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
um from one of our providers ERS I'm
 
05:29:40.470 --> 05:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I'm not a
 
05:29:42.750 --> 05:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
practicing clinician not a clinician at
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
all um but happy to take questions if
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment has not been
 
05:29:54.190 --> 05:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
formally introduced because we are not
 
05:29:56.110 --> 05:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
in an exact session the chair made a
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
ruling that since this is what we will
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably consider we should consider it
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
now and not fight over stuff that
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
probably won't ever appear in an exec
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
session if the prime Spa answer wishes
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
at some point to uh consult with anybody
 
05:30:16.750 --> 05:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
everybody or nobody that is your
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
prerogative so that if the amendment
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
when we have an exec session is exactly
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment that is your privilege if
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%

you okay let's take the blue sheet out
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
with the dirty printer that I could not
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
clean let's look at the blue sheet
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
follow the blue sheet because repres
 
05:32:35.470 --> 05:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
former representative Gaye four minutes
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
is about to start now okay the
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and sponsors of this bill
 
05:32:43.390 --> 05:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
read like The Who's Who of people who
 
05:32:47.350 --> 05:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
are concerned for kids and I I feel like
 
05:32:50.590 --> 05:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
one of them um I have a criticism of
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that I wish could be built
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
into it I don't want to trash the bill I
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
just want it fixed um Aces Aces were
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned adverse childhood experiences
 
05:33:04.990 --> 05:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
those are critical the if somebody has
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
four of the 10 the chances are that will
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
lose 12 years of their life so we are
 
05:33:15.430 --> 05:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
talking about really serious things um
 
05:33:17.310 --> 05:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about what's the difference
 
05:33:17.320 --> 05:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about what's the difference
between

05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
psychological versus emotional abuse to
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
me they sound like the same it sounds
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
like kind of
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
Overkill um immediate intervention
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
removing children requires immediate
 
05:33:36.430 --> 05:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
investigation to verify or clear
 
05:33:36.440 --> 05:33:38.230 align:start position:0%
investigation to verify or clear
apparent

05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
05:33:41.310 --> 05:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh one of the reasons that family court
 
05:33:44.590 --> 05:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
has such a bad rep reputation around
 
05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
this world is for the errors that are
 
05:33:50.350 --> 05:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
made they either don't remove children
 
05:33:52.350 --> 05:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
or they remove children who shouldn't be
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
removed and speed is of the essence so
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
whatever if you're going to do an exp
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
parte because you think a child's in
 
05:34:02.590 --> 05:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
danger you not only need to do the
 
05:34:05.948 --> 05:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
remove the child quickly but you need to
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
investigate quickly because we are aware
 
05:34:12.510 --> 05:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
of many people using it as ammunition
 
05:34:14.350 --> 05:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
against a parent they're trying to get
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
even with so then they know that that
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
child's going to be removed probably to
 
05:34:22.110 --> 05:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
them for an extended period of time
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
while this investigation slowly takes
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
part that is
 
05:34:30.788 --> 05:34:30.798 align:start position:0%
cruel there has to be a review this is
 
05:34:33.030 --> 05:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
my opinion this is what I want to see
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
put into the bill there must be a review
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the judicial court order by a review
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
board who are not part of the Court the
 
05:34:48.190 --> 05:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
only review we have right now is the JCC
 
05:34:50.270 --> 05:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee they are
 
05:34:54.030 --> 05:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
staffed by attorneys and Court employees
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's no wonder that they almost never
 
05:34:58.830 --> 05:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
find a
 
05:35:01.868 --> 05:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
finding well the Review Board needs to
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
be created consistently of child
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
psychologists pediatricians
 
05:35:07.840 --> 05:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
psychologists pediatricians
adult

05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
adult
 
05:35:12.670 --> 05:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
psychologist people who are not part of
 
05:35:15.548 --> 05:35:15.558 align:start position:0%
that of of that
 
05:35:17.948 --> 05:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
investigation but they have the
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
expertise that can evaluate the family
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
one of the other bills that people are
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
asking for is that whenever a child is
 
05:35:28.510 --> 05:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
evaluated or or be treated they' be
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated first to see if there really
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
is an issue there that the child need
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
needs counseling or the family needs
 
05:35:43.750 --> 05:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the the last thing is the
 
05:35:48.868 --> 05:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
very name description of the
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill triggering a rebuttable presumption
 
05:35:56.708 --> 05:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
of harm in abuse and neglect rebuttable
 
05:36:02.070 --> 05:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
opposite it presumes that you are guilty
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
and you have to prove that you're
 
05:36:10.910 --> 05:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:14.670 --> 05:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
start any questions for not only former
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative gay but alumna of this
 
05:36:18.910 --> 05:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee am I correct well no I always
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on this you always wanted
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
to be and you wanted to be me on this
 
05:36:24.990 --> 05:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee only then I didn't get elected
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
and you got put on this committee life
 
05:36:27.040 --> 05:36:28.868 align:start position:0%
and you got put on this committee life
is

05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
cruel I got that
 
05:36:35.310 --> 05:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
anybody uh I've mentioned this before I
 
05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
don't think I've mentioned it to you uh
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
we made some beginning progress in the
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
of Circuit Court basically we picked lwh
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit and I think we did some
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
good work um I asked the speaker if we
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
could come back and try a couple more
 
05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
years because of the trust level we did
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
not come at them adversarially we came
 
05:37:00.190 --> 05:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
at them collaboratively to gang up
 
05:37:03.070 --> 05:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
together to fix problems and they worked
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
very well with us but now maybe with
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
that trust level we could go a little
 
05:37:09.628 --> 05:37:09.638 align:start position:0%
little bit higher up the tree to some of
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
these other issues I asked the speaker
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
therefore would he reconstitute that
 
05:37:15.910 --> 05:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee and he said no but what he
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
said was Mr chairman you can form a
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee out of this committee and
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
continue the work so I probably will and
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting that what you said if you
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
could put that in a memo to me about
 
05:37:34.110 --> 05:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
where you see one of the problems now
 
05:37:37.708 --> 05:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
Solutions are not obvious necessarily
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh some people were accusing judges of
 
05:37:42.430 --> 05:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
knocking off work at 4 in the afternoon
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
what that meant was that was the last
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
case they heard you know my wife the
 
05:37:49.628 --> 05:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
last person she sees is a doctor is at 4
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon she gets home at
 
05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
quarter to 8 the problem is not the
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
judges in this case the problem is
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's not nearly enough of them so
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
things have to be put out because
 
05:38:01.270 --> 05:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of other people
 
05:38:03.830 --> 05:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
needing to have a court case before we
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
can get around to you again we need more
 
05:38:08.830 --> 05:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
judges and uh this may not be the time
 
05:38:11.948 --> 05:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
to do it that is one aspect of this your
 
05:38:14.590 --> 05:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
point about a
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
review panel on judicial orders that may
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
be something we would want to consider
 
05:38:22.788 --> 05:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
but could you put it up in about five
 
05:38:25.750 --> 05:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and send that to me because
 
05:38:29.070 --> 05:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
I'm collecting possible topics for our
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
next round as we work with family court
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and may I make the suggestion
 
05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
that crafting bills that affect the
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
court could also use their input so
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
rather than just counting on their
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
acquiescence and liking your ideas that
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
it actually gets put into writing into
 
05:38:53.430 --> 05:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
bills instead of just practice you may
 
05:38:55.030 --> 05:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
be excited to know that some of us are
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing just that uh perhaps we could do
 
05:39:00.670 --> 05:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
that some more but certainly uh for some
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
of us who have uh relationships with
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
justices we've run things by them I'm
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
testifying on a bill tomorrow that has
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time with the
 
05:39:14.830 --> 05:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
administration of circuit court so that
 
05:39:18.070 --> 05:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh something that could work but
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the suggestion anyway
 
05:39:23.230 --> 05:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else last call did I use up
 
05:39:25.468 --> 05:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
every second because I wanted to say
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
what this is it was what I said you have
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
precisely 22 seconds to tell me what
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is okay this is several several
 
05:39:36.270 --> 05:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
different sources for information
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
because people like to say oh the courts
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
favor women or the courts favor
 
05:39:45.548 --> 05:39:45.558 align:start position:0%
men family court has a bad reputation
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
around the world especially in all the
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
English-speaking uh english- speaking
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
countries so they have they have good
 
05:39:55.948 --> 05:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
ideas but this shows you that really
 
05:39:58.468 --> 05:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
things need to get fixed and it's not
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
just slanted not just for women or Not
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%

opposition to the bill as written um
 
05:41:34.468 --> 05:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
specifically I just want to call out a
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
provision that's been um cited already
 
05:41:40.750 --> 05:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
um under the neglect statute or neglect
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
definition section e on the amendment
 
05:41:44.910 --> 05:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's lines 27 through 29 we've already
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
touched on it we have the same concerns
 
05:41:48.750 --> 05:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
that have brought been brought up that
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
this may have a chilling effect on on uh
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
pregnant parents seeking treatment um
 
05:41:57.070 --> 05:41:57.080 align:start position:0%

pren prenatal care and uh subsequently
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
perinatal care um we would suggest
 
05:42:06.310 --> 05:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
removal of this provision um in which
