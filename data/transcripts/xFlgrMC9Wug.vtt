committee uh house bill 1050.
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
let me just die Mr chairman by telling
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
the committee what this bill isn't this
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
bill is not intended in any way to
 
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
diminish Veterans Day that takes place
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
on November 11th as a veteran
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
especially as the Via War veteran uh I
 
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
have tremendous respect and admiration
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
for anybody who served in our Armed
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
Forces whether in time of War what this
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
asked the governor to issue a
 
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 align:start position:0%
proclamation that
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
that declares that November 11th in New
 
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will also be known as
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
Remembrance Day
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
that is not a state holiday
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
the governor issues several
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
proclamations throughout the year
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
honoring different days for example in
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
June he issues a proclamation honoring
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
the Marquis De lafayette's a visit to
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in June of 1825 so it's
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
simply a remembrance by the state or
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment by the state
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
then enough status is also known as
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
Remembrance Day
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure you know Mr chairman
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
November 11th Max the end of World War
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
One when that war ended on the 11th day
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the 11th month at the 11th Hour
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
and then that war over 400 000 Americans
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
died uh I think it was 670 000 were
 
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
died uh I think it was 670 000 were
casualties

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
casualties
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
twenty four thousand five hundred were
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
Marines Mr chairman and it was really it
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
was said to be the war to end all wars
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
um and I just hope
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
that on that date that we remember those
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
of world war one that died and uh and
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
those that didn't come home
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
I will add that I'm as a veteran
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat disappointed in our own
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day and what's happened uh in
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
the lack of true recognition of that day
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
in May
 
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
in May
um

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
that date started May 30th in 1868 when
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
the Grand Army of the Republic the four
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
would decorate Graves of Fallen Union
 
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.830 align:start position:0%
would decorate Graves of Fallen Union
Souls

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
churches and um
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they picked that date because no
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
major battle took place they wanted
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
people to Simply focus on those that
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
died and not on any battle
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
and then in 1968 Congress passed and the
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
president signed a bill making Memorial
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
Day a Monday holiday
 
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.270 align:start position:0%
Day a Monday holiday
um

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
it was said it was done because of the
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
fuel crisis others that it was done
 
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
because to make to help the tourist
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
industry whatever the reason
 
00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.350 align:start position:0%
industry whatever the reason
um

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
if you ask most New Hampshire citizens
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
what Memorial Day means they'll tell you
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
that it it's the first day of summer or
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
a time to buy a new vehicle or an
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
appliance it's they've lost the meaning
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
acknowledging Remembrance Day and the
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
end of World War One
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
to do simply that remember the war dead
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the first World War
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
and I'll close by saying my mom was born
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
in Ireland and she used to tell me that
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's an old Irish saying
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
that it's better to give one rose to the
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
living than a dozen for the Dead
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
in what I see this bill doing
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
on Veterans Day
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
is always giving a dozen roses to our
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
living veterans and thanking them for
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
this service but maybe just setting
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
aside one rose for the dead on that date
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
and just remembering those that did give
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
their life for our country
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know someone who has seen Americans
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
shed their blood in Florence oil I think
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
anytime we can remember our war dead
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's always good but of course it's
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
always Veterans Day in honoring the
 
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
living but not forgetting our debt do we
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions for
 
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.570 align:start position:0%
have any questions for
um representative

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019 align:start position:0%
will the day be known as veterans and
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
Remembrance Day or veterans Remembrance
 
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.260 align:start position:0%
Day it'll always be Veterans Day period
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
the only time remembrance would be used
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
would be that the governor signs the
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
proclamation saying that in New
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's also a day of remembrance
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
for the end of world war one but it's
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
always it always will be in New
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterans Day there are many
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
days that take place throughout the year
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
that the governor recognizes a lot of
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
times we don't even hear about them such
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
as Lafayette day and other dates it's
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
just something
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's something I know and we know that
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
it is also Remembrance Day and not to
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
make a big celebration out or ought to
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
I get a couple of questions again for
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
you to representative how many states uh
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
call A Remembrance Day I don't believe
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
any state does to my knowledge
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
you know what Mr chairman to add on to
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
your question if you go to Canada on the
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
11th whether you watch the news and you
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
see the newscasters wearing poppies or
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to a Tim Hortons for
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
coffee the staff is wearing white
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
poppies and as I said Veterans Day is a
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
day that everyone should be honoring our
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
living Veterans for this service but if
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to wear a poppy on that
 
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:08.180 align:start position:0%
day just in their own hat to remember
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
those that passed that would be fine
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
especially in the first world war no I
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
agree I've been wearing the poppy here
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
for about 15 years that we're on my I
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
might wear my VV not Veterans of America
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
or pen every day and when I say the
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
pledge my index finger goes on that to
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
remind me of those that didn't come home
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%

committee I really have a couple things
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
I want to take care of this morning the
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
first is for those of you that don't
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
know what we do I'm here today well
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm my name is Kevin Grady
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
I have uh after a 25-year career in our
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
Air Force I've lived in Hooksett for the
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
last 23 years uh Mr Grady can I stop you
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
for a minute I have absolutely two cards
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry there was a confusion got
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
put in my same pile I'm sorry different
 
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
builds I'm here a lot this morning so I
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
figured I'd fill out the cards in
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
advance and give them to uh to the
 
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.970 align:start position:0%
advance and give them to uh to the
chairman

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
um as I said I'm a 25-year uh military
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
veteran from the Air Force I'm also a
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
um a 23-year resident of Hooksett
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the state veterans advisory committee
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
is why I'm here today I represent the
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee and
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
the opinions that I'm going to tell you
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
this morning are theirs not mine it's
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
the the consensus of of the group number
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
one there's 20 members for those of you
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with what we do there's 20
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
member organizations of our committee
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
and we're chartered by state RSA to
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
actually speak for the veteran community
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things we do is we
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
look at all of the bills out there that
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
we think have better an impact and then
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
we discuss them and take a position on
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
them and then I come and tell you what
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
they thought
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
um they they were not high they were not
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
very fired up about this bill
 
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:25.940 align:start position:0%
um we think the idea of Veterans Day
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
is it kind of speaks for itself you
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
start calling it something else it it it
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
tends to muddy the waters a little bit
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
and if you read what the bill actually
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
asked the governor to do which is to
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
just send out a proclamation and suggest
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
that cities and towns do activities and
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
parades and things like that but we're
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
already doing those kind of things
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
um when I I taught Air Force Junior ROTC
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
down at Auburn High School in Hudson for
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
11 years and we always used to teach our
 
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
students that we really have two days a
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
year that are set aside for these kinds
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
of celebrations we have Memorial Day
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
which is set aside for those veterans
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
that have passed either in battle or or
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
served in a wartime and have since
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
passed and then we have Veterans Day
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
that honors all veterans but the idea of
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
a Remembrance Day is now we're we're now
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
kind of tying that a little bit towards
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
that the World War One veterans which
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
we're accounting for on on Memorial Day
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the last thing that I want to do is you
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
may have heard from your constituents
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
about this because I know I heard from
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
mine but about two years ago the
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
adjutant general came to us and said
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
what do you want to do about Veterans
 
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.610 align:start position:0%
what do you want to do about Veterans
Day

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
Day
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
so those of you who've been around for a
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
while used to know we had a a ceremony
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
up at the state that the state Cemetery
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
every year at about 11 o'clock in the
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
morning and we had the governor there we
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
had all our political our Congressional
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
Delegation was always there and and a
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the leaders of all of these
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
veterans groups had to be there and in
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
order to do that they had to skip what
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
was going on in their hometowns
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
and so they the we we talked about it
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we said we would rather be
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
in our home towns doing the celebrations
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
there with our our local people than we
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
would be doing a Statewide thing in in
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
boscoin well you probably heard about
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
that from your constituents and we heard
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
about it from our constituents too
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I could tell you is
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
that probably later on this fall when we
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
get we get cranked back up in September
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
or October we're going to discuss this
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
again and and we may make a different
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
decision for 2022 and going forward but
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%

wondering okay

uh
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
I represent a community of blue-collar
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
workers many who are veterans and I was
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
asked to submit this piece of
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
legislation on behalf of a few of them
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to thank you for
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony today and on
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and I want to thank those
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
behind me for being here today
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
HP 1092fn
 
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.950 align:start position:0%
HP 1092fn
um

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
So I myself am not a veteran however I
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
represent a community of blue collar
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
workers many who are veterans
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
um I had a constituent reach out and
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
point me in the direction of this piece
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
of legislation and so I put it together
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
for him
 
00:33:26.289 --> 00:33:26.299 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that I do agree with
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise I wouldn't have submitted this
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislation in the first place I have a
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
lot of respect for the individual and
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
you've heard something similar to this
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the past and it always tends to come
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
up that we're going to lose millions of
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
dollars so on
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
other states have proposed the same
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
legislation and yet they do not see a
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
reduction in their spending
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
the intent of the National Guard is to
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
insist the state when necessary for
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
example military nurses and doctors
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
being deployed to Community Hospitals
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
during the covid-19 pandemic
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen Wars wage on for generations
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
and we've seen presidents remove
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
military personnel from countries
 
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.570 align:start position:0%
military personnel from countries
recklessly

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
recklessly
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would require an official
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
declaration of war by Congress which for
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
the record is required by the
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
Constitution to declare war in the first
 
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.970 align:start position:0%

place

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%

we've

um
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
we've seen presidents prolonged War
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
this needs to stop and hopefully it
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
starts today
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
please join me in passing this important
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you representative
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
Belanger for for being here and uh very
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
interesting and important issue my
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
question has to do with the New
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire International Guard and I
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
believe there's a refueling unit or
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
refueling Squadron out of peas and I
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
know that during some of our recent uh
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
Undeclared conflicts so to speak the
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
Middle East that that we feel that New
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire refueling of it there may be
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
some folks here who could later speak to
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
that uh was activated now the reserve
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
component in the National Guard
 
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
components sometimes are activated or
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
federalized so the the mission of this
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
refueling outfit was crucial to getting
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
you know some of the airplanes some of
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
the air power across the ocean so
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
my question is if this were to move
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
forward and become law would this
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
preclude uh the the utilization of this
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
particular refueling outfit that
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
apparently in the past has been needed
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
by the by the Air Force
 
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:04.820 align:start position:0%
no because it does thank you
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt for your question
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
and thank you for pronouncing my name
 
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.770 align:start position:0%
and thank you for pronouncing my name
correctly

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.810 align:start position:0%
correctly
um

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:10.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
in in the way that I view this piece of
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislation it does not because it allow
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know you still putting the power in
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
so it gives the ability of the governor
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
so it should be necessary Governor still
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
has the power of the National Guard to
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
give them orders as they see fit because
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's just what the National Guard was
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
meant to do in the first place
 
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:36.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up okay thank you so
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
from what I understand from your
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
response then is that
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass then this refueling
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
unit or some like reserve or guy or I
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
should say National Guard unit if the uh
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
if the president or or the Pentagon
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
needed that support they would have to
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
just go through our governor and then he
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
would sign on to support it if he wanted
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
to that would be the intent yes sir okay
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering what other
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
states have passed this legislation
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with that unfortunately
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me have a
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
taking another question representative
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so National Guardsmen serve under the
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
Dual enlistment uh since 1916 so they're
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
both part of the state militia and uh
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
Federal forces so I was wondering is a
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
declaration of war needed to mobilize
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
federal troops at any time
 
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.609 align:start position:0%
federal troops at any time
yeah

00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the Constitution
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative Brody
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
um representative deshays and yes
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
certainly can you answer don't ask my
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
committee members any question can you
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
answer the question he asked please
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
Congress is required to uh
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
declare a declaration of war
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
and it is required every 30 days to do
 
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.450 align:start position:0%
and it is required every 30 days to do
so

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up good my question wasn't in
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
regard to mobilizing troops for a war it
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
was in regards to mobilizing troops for
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
any kind of action respectfully I think
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
I answered the question the best way
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
that I can okay thank you
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
one else I have a couple here um are you
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
aware that this bill has been here in
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
2008 2012 and 2021 yes that's why I said
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
that okay are you aware that
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
um there was a case a few years ago and
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
I left my um stuff on my desk at my
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
house and I don't know if it was
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Minnesota versus the us or
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of the states uh on this same issue
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
where they said that the president
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have the authority to activate
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
the national God and that they could
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
stop it and the court said no you're
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
wrong uh the president does have the
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
authority are you aware of that
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
so I am aware that there is
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
there may be case law but I am not
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with that specific case law no
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
okay my next question to you would be
 
00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
okay my next question to you would be
that

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
um under this here bill
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
um are you well first of all are you
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not going to educate John right
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
now but
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
um I I would think that in the future
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
that you would take a look at title 10
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
versus title 32 and that you'll look at
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution under the
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
president's duties uh to activate
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the militia
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
for the you know safety of the U.S or
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
however it's worded without pulling out
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitution then if you look at the
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution it gives the
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
guidance to the governor on you know as
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
the commander-in-chief but throughout
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
the years the president once he
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
activates Governors have no choice are
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
you aware of that
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes I'm aware of that I was not aware of
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
that that title 10 is what you were
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
referring to okay thank you are there
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions you have
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for your testimony and
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%

representing the state veterans advisory
 
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
representing the state veterans advisory
committee

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
um we unanimously oppose this
 
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.670 align:start position:0%
um we unanimously oppose this
legislation

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and since this morning has been a
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
little bit about history uh let's let's
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
talk just a little bit about about
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
history because it really Bears on this
 
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:03.500 align:start position:0%
particular legislation
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
most people think that we we last had
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
Congress declare war right after the
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor but the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
truth of the matter is if you look it up
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
it was actually on the 5th of June of
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
1942 where we sort of declared war
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
against uh Bulgaria and Hungary and
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
Romania it's a sort of clean up who we
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
were fighting against already over there
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
in 1942 and that is the last time that
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
Congress actually declared uh War but
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that Congress hasn't
 
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
been involved okay in 1964 to North
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
Korea and uh I'm sorry in North
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese Patrol Boats were stupid
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
enough to fire on the USS Navy and were
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
sunk and people went to to the Congress
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
and they said they're shooting at our
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
boys over there in Vietnam and the
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
resolution which basically said Mr
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
President here's a blank check go spend
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to spend out there
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
well after the Vietnam years and some of
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
you are in here are veterans of that
 
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.970 align:start position:0%
you are in here are veterans of that
time

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
um the Congress said boy that was a
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
terrible idea and they passed What's
 
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:07.099 align:start position:0%
called the War Powers Resolution of
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
1973. and what that basically says is Mr
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
President you can go anyplace in the
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
world that you want to go to to defend
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
American interests but after 30 days and
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
this is where the 30 Days part comes in
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
after 30 days if you don't get an
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
authorization from us in the Congress in
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
order to use Force then we can do what
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
we do Congress controls the military
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
because they control the money the cash
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's how that that whole process
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
works and
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
so if you look at history since then why
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
did President George H.W bush go ask the
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
Congress for a resolution for the use of
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
force when he went to Desert Storm
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
because he's required to by the War
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
Powers Resolution of 73. same thing for
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
President George W Bush when he decided
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
to go to Iraq in 2003 why did he get
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
Congress to authorize that because he's
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
required to so the Congress is already
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
involved in a lot of these things even
 
00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
though they haven't actually declared
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
war and if you look at things since then
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
you will see instances Like Us in Syria
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
during the Obama Administration where we
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
didn't go in there for too long because
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
they knew they weren't going to be able
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
to get an authorization for the use of
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
force from the Congress so the Congress
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
is still involved in all this
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
keeping with my history theme
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
after Desert Storm the military across
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
the board downsized to a pretty small
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
version and I got to tell you from when
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that happened especially in the air
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
force that I represent all right which
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
right now the Air Force has less
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
airplanes than at any time since we
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
became a separate service in 1947 okay
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
so the guard in the reserve forces that
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have around our country are not a
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
nice to have anymore they're a must-have
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
and as the representative said
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the tanker unit at peas is there for
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
a reason they're they're there to drag
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
airplanes across the pond in both
 
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:03.500 align:start position:0%
directions and the active duty military
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
needs that support every single day in
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
order to do their mission they
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
absolutely need it every single day and
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
the guard and the reserve forces that
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
you would find if you went out and
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
talked to somebody at peas that flies
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
tankers he would tell you you know
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes I fly one of ours sometimes I
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
fly an active duty tanker sometimes I
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
fly somebody else's tanker okay the
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
crews are interchangeable the airplanes
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
are interchangeable the whole operation
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
is kind of interchangeable there really
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
is no such thing as our National Guard
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
forces deploying on mass without the
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
governor and the the adjutant general
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
knowing about this well in advance okay
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
most of the time it's going to require
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
some training that they're going to have
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
to go to before they go down range it's
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
all coordinated I'm not talking get
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
about a couple months in advance I'm
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
talking years in advance and this is all
 
00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:57.859 align:start position:0%
coordinated the governor knows it
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative albusero talked about
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
title 10 at any time the president can
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
say I'm putting our people under title
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
10 orders and because we're paying the
 
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
bill we the federal government are
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
paying the bill we the taxpayers are
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
paying the bill the governor really
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to say nah I
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
don't think so I think I'm going to keep
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
my my taker guys home this weekend I'm
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sending them when you when
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
you put them on on federal orders
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't realize this you
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
know you know about the guard will they
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
work one weekend a month they work
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
um one uh one or two weeks a year during
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
the summer or some other time when they
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
can tell you who pays for that federal
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
government it gets routed through the
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
state but the feds pay for that when our
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
guys drill so the federal government and
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state government are intertwined on
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
this the situation that the way it is
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
right now is is really about as good as
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
you can get it and if you try and
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation like this first of
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
all this is this this is now not the
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
opinion this is the Kevin Grady opinion
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
there's no chance on Earth that Governor
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
sununu signs this bill there's no chance
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that number
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
one there's only two things about it
 
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
that if he signed it that would it would
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
number one would be you don't understand
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
how the situation works with the guard
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
and the active forces and all of that
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
which he most certainly does or number
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
two which is worse you know what the
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
rules are but you choose to
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally just disregard them
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
for reasons that we can't figure out so
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know our guys didn't get as spun up
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
about this bill as as you would think
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
that that as maybe that I'm getting spun
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
up about it a little bit this morning
 
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.370 align:start position:0%
up about it a little bit this morning
but

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
things like this
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to use the word
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
annoy they they they upset veterans
 
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.170 align:start position:0%
annoy they they they upset veterans
because

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
because
the

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
the system as it works today is is about
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
as good as you can get it and and
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
introducing things like this are not
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
going to to fix that okay uh I apologize
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
I went over my few minutes uh sir uh
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative baldacero and I now I'll
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
take questions if or I'll get off the
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
Grady for being here and we do have some
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
times I I will bring this up I want to
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
follow up on a point you made about uh
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh
 
00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:28.510 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh
uh

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
response to that by different presidents
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh both President Bush's but
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
specifically uh president H.W bush in
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
January of 1991 in fact the uh our chair
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
was was deployed in the Middle East at
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that time and we had around a hundred uh
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
half and half a million roughly uh
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel including
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh Guardsmen reservists in uh theater
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
Southwest Asia so in January of 1991 the
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
U.S Senate uh took up as you may recall
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh because of this War Powers Resolution
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the authorization used Force which did
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
pass the Senate very narrowly and then
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know Desert Storm commenced
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
but President Bush 41 uh supposedly
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
indicated that he had a half million men
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
and women and service people deployed in
 
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.170 align:start position:0%
and women and service people deployed in
theater

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
theater
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
and uh had the U.S Senate not authorized
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
for us he was going to use Force anyway
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and I'm not so
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
my question is uh what is your
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
recollection of of that time frame and
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
and uh had force not been authorized and
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
the president would have gone ahead and
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know used all this Force to include
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh reservists and Guardsmen
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
um what would the implications of that
 
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.750 align:start position:0%
um what would the implications of that
be

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
um well sir to be honest I I had never
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
actually heard that story that that the
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
president was prepared to go ahead uh in
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
any case I know that at the time I was
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
flying f-15s on Okinawa and you can't
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
imagine how unhappy we all were that um
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know we've trained all of our career
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
I trained at that point of my career for
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
16 years in case my country needed me
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
and now I just happened to be stationed
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the wrong theater of operations and
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're you're going to have a war and
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're not going to invite me that was
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
our that was our attitude on on Okinawa
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
we were ready to go and we you know we
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
were told you got to stay home and keep
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
an eye on North Korea while these other
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
guys go over and fight the war and to be
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
sure the air War for people like me that
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
flew f-15s that were in the air Superior
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
already role the Iraqi Air Force was
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
really no match for our air force on
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
this and they were they were done in
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
less than a week and after that you know
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
the f-15c models that I used to fly were
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
kind of getting in the way you're you're
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
sort of you're using gas at some Bomb
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
Dropper really needs up here so but I
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
had never heard anything like that I
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that uh that a president
 
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
could could survive going against the
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
will of the Congress like that I just I
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
started to be honest I've never heard
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
that story I I don't know what else to
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.970 align:start position:0%
tell you
uh

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:15.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
your theme is great yeah there's no uh
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's it can uh hypothetical question but
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's one that uh some of us have just
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
always wondered about uh had that forced
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
resolution not been approved what was
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
the president going to do with these
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
half million uh troops and forces uh in
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
in theater uh so what would happen What
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
would happen if it was not approved
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
is then the Congress would have to turn
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
around via the War Powers Resolution and
 
00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:44.690 align:start position:0%
around via the War Powers Resolution and
say

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
as of X date you're not allowed to spend
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
any more money on that
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then those people would have had to
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
turn around and come home and obviously
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
they would have had to work out a
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
deployment schedule in 30 days you're
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
not going to get it took them from
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
August when when Kuwait was invaded
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
until January to get that many forces in
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
theater and be ready to go so it would
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
take almost that long I would think to
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
get those people out of there if the
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
Congress had said no thank you thank you
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions uh yes
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
can you turn your mic
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if this bill was
 
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.250 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if this bill was
passed

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
what would the impact of losing a
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars be on the
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
that's a question I'm sure we could ask
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
locally we yeah I'm sure we could ask uh
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry behind me is probably
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
better qualified to answer this than
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
than I am but
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
um if if the United States decide if if
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire decided that
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't want to play by
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
these rules anymore I believe that the
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
dod would simply pick up their equipment
 
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:53.579 align:start position:0%
and go home they would say we'll we'll
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
send some Crews to go get those tankers
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
and we'll give them to someone else
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
um I I would expect that that would be
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
what would happen same thing with the
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
guards uh the the Army National Guard's
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
equipment you know a senator I mean
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu didn't write a check for
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
those Casey 46s okay we those are owned
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
by the the Department of Defense and
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
they could move them to any other any
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
other state that that wanted to you know
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
abide by the rules that are currently
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
written as to how we how we operate and
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly that in short order that
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
that would happen and then there
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any point in having a New
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Air National Guard without any
 
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
air airplanes to fly
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you could argue one could
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
argue we could still keep a small
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
portion of Army National Guard people
 
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.910 align:start position:0%
portion of Army National Guard people
for

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and things of that
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
nature but there wouldn't be a need for
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh certainly the need for the Air
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
National Guard if the if we were to sign
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
legislation like this
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Kevin I of course has a an old

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
Joe recognize uh Colonel Warren Perry
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record Warren
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
Perry Deputy ads in general for New
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services uh I'd like
 
00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:35.059 align:start position:0%
to start by saying the department
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
opposes uh House Bill 1092 FN for many
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that were stated by Mr
 
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.309 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that were stated by Mr
Grady

00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
Grady
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh most notably is that Congress is
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
involved when Federal forces or National
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
Guard forces are federalized uh one of
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the things he didn't mention was that in
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
2001 Congress passed the authorization
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
to use military forces uh and that bill
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
that was really contemplated because we
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
really aren't fighting countries anymore
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
as we are entities right so we can't
 
00:54:09.609 --> 00:54:09.619 align:start position:0%
declare war against
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
Isis for example so they they authorized
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
the president to to use Force use
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
military force and as the
 
00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
military force and as the
commander-in-chief

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
the president has the authority to
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
mobilize and federalize the National
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
Guard of the United States from whatever
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
state he wants to do that so that's what
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
we believe so that's really the basis of
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
our uh of our opposition there are some
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
other things right so we're not
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
contemplating whether or not it's
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional we don't we don't argue
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
that uh whether it's constitutional we
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
do know that Congress is involved
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
Congress has authorized the use and the
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
federalization of those forces there are
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
some court cases pending now about who
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
has the authority to give orders to the
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
National Guard is it the governor is it
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of the of defense is it
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
the secretary of the army or the
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of the Air Force and generally
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government's winning those
 
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.230 align:start position:0%
the federal government's winning those
fights

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
fights
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
generally not necessarily related to the
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
use of force in combat but they have the
 
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
authority and I think that will bleed
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
over into those other things
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to the impact of funding in
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note we reckon we we
 
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
recognize the risk to the loss of
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
federal fund right so we didn't say that
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
the federal government is going to come
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
down and take away 100 million dollars
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
we said that funding would be at risk
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
and certainly it would
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
so the reason the National Guard is
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
equipped and manned is because the
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
federal government sees a need to have a
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
reserve or a a force that they can reach
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
into to to continue to close with and
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
destroy the enemies of the United States
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's really kind of what
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
what it is we do
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
so they man us uh they pay for that
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
Manning and they pay for our equipment
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's helicopters or trucks or
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
rifles or kc-46 aircraft because the Air
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
Force guy wants to talk about airplanes
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
they give us that equipment for that
 
00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:03.260 align:start position:0%
purpose that those things would go away
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
now if the if the kc-46 went away would
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
there be an impact to the state of New
 
00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:09.410 align:start position:0%
there be an impact to the state of New
Hampshire

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
not really because the state of New
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't use the kc-46 air
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
refueling tanker but they took away all
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
our trucks
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
there would be no PPE delivery in the
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
so those things that the federal
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
government gives us that we use to
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
support the state of New Hampshire would
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
be at risk
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
and that's really when we're talking
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
about you know the potential for 100
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars of federal funding to be
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
impacted that's really what we talk
 
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.530 align:start position:0%
impacted that's really what we talk
about

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to talk uh addressed a
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
couple of things I heard just to have
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
them on the record from the Department
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any other state who has
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
the role of the National Guard of New
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the National Guard in
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
general is threefold not twofold we have
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
a state mission to respond in times of
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
emergency inside Estates and to other
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
states when they need it
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
we have a federal role to fight the
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
enemies of the United States and protect
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
our sovereignty
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
and we build Partnerships we build
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
Eternal Partnerships we have
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
Partnerships now established with the
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
country of El Salvador and now with Cabo
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
uh not Cabo San Lucas Cabo Verde
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
so we we have these missions that we we
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
do and they are not sometimes the lines
 
00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:28.430 align:start position:0%
do and they are not sometimes the lines
blur

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
blur
 
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:30.260 align:start position:0%
as in the federal
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
resourcing of our response to covid in
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
the state under title 32 and sometimes
 
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
they don't blur like we have people in
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Middle East right now supporting uh
 
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
supporting under the
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
next thing I heard was that the governor
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
can choose whether or not to support or
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
not support or Direct Federal missions
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's not true he has no authority to
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
direct any federal Mission zero none
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
he has he's a force provider and he
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't really as a force provider the
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
governor doesn't have the authority to
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
say no that's clear in title 10 in the
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I supplied to the
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee you can see the reference
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
there I won't go into its legalese I'll
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
be sure to answer any questions that you
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
have but it's not an option when the
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief of the United States
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
tells the governor I'm taking your
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
forces to go to war
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
with regard to the contemplation of what
 
00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
would we do if the president of the
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
United States decides to defy congress's
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
requirement to have an authorization of
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
uniform the use of force I would say
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's hypothetical I can't answer the
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
question but I would say as a as a a
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
member of the second Army Calvary
 
00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.130 align:start position:0%
member of the second Army Calvary
regiment

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
regiment
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
leading the seventh Corps across
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
the Iraqi and Kuwaiti deserts only took
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
us a hundred hours so it didn't really
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
matter right
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
we really kind of went through that
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
country relatively quickly now there was
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
some cleanup that had to go on but the
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
use of force was relatively quick
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
right the Air Force and the Marine Corps
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
and the Navy softened them up real good
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
for us right so it was about 100 hours
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
they didn't get much sleep in those
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
hundred hours but it was
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
it was very good
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
so uh that is my testimony and subject
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
to any questions uh
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is my testimony uh thank you uh
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative deschase in uh if you
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
could permit Mr chairman could have a
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up after my question yes go ahead
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
you Colonel Perry for taking my question
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you our national
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen both federal troops and the
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
state militia just so we can be very
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
clear not at the same time but yes so
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
they have that dual mission right so
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
they when so I think the best way to
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
answer your question and and thank you
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the question is they swear two Oaths
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
when I joined the regular army 1986 I
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
swore oath to defend the Constitution
 
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
United States and obey the orders of the
 
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:54.589 align:start position:0%
United States and obey the orders of the
president

00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
when a Guardsman swears an oath when he
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
enlists or is commissioned he swears an
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
oath to defend the Constitution United
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
States and the president and obey the
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
president and the constitution of New
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the governor so they are
 
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.730 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the governor so they are
both

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
but not generally at the same time
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for clarifying that and
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh follow up Mr chairman
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
um is a declaration of war needed to
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
mobilize federal troops in support of
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
federal missions even if it's an armed
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
conflict and can you speak to this
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
specifically as it's addressed towards
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard so the
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
answer is the president has the
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
authority to federalize the National
 
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.829 align:start position:0%
authority to federalize the National
Guard

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
Guard
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
when he sees fit title 10 makes that
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
very clear so if you look at the written
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
testimony that and I can read the
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
passage there but it's in there I don't
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
think I need to read it to you I read it
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
so so the answer is yes the short answer
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
to your question is yes the president
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't need the governor's permission
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
to do that without a declaration of war
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
Congress in our our opinion right and
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're not debating the constitutionality
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the authorization for the use of
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
military force the War Powers Act we're
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
not debating that at all Congress has
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
given the president the authority to
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
mobilize the the federal forces the
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
state forces the reserves for armed
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
conflict they have so the answer the
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes I think I've
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
answered your question but I may not
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
have uh I think you did too thank you
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions on this
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
side uh representative Perez thank you
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
for that for the time thank you for
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
taking my my question uh Colonel Perry
 
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.710 align:start position:0%
taking my my question uh Colonel Perry
um I

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
I want to hear a little bit more I'm
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
from El Salvador and you mentioned in
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
something from El Salvador and I didn't
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
really pay attention to it and I just
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
wanted like you to like tell me exactly
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
what our celebrity is doing
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
so the the National Guard has a program
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the state department
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of State
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
and the combatant commanders so we have
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
a Central Command Commander that deals
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
with Central America we have a a South
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a South Comp Commander that
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
deals with Central Command deals with uh
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the Middle East generally africom
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
so these Regional commanders so in
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
conjunction with these Regional
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
combatant Commanders and the U.S
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
Department of State the National Guard
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
establishes a state partnership program
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
and different National Guards have
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
programs with different states we have a
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
program with El Salvador and we have had
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
that program for some number of years
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's flourishing I'd be happy to await
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know since it's non-germaine to this
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill I'd be happy to talk to you in a
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
break or and get you any other
 
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.230 align:start position:0%
break or and get you any other
information

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions over there
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
I had a couple for you there um
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
can you explain to the committee here
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
like um I mean I know we brought up
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
about the KC 46 is what happens to like
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
I think the planes that go up the coast
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
there that God certain areas are when
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're activated to fly like what
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
happened when on 9 11 when the you know
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
they were planes up in a year who would
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
refuel those aircraft I mean is in that
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
part of your mission so the the the the
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
157th air refueling Wing has their
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
mission is aerial refueling uh their
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
primary Mission they generally fly every
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
day in support of the air bridge over
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
the North Atlantic so they're generally
 
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:15.500 align:start position:0%
refueling somebody
 
01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:18.140 align:start position:0%
you know going between here and Europe
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
every day okay so so if there's
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
something going on they're going to
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
mobilize those aircraft to get them in
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
the air to keep to keep the combat the
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
combatant aircraft in the area my my
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
other question so the committee
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
understands and knows how many
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
um federal employees you have that
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
federal employees during the week
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
working and on the weekend one week in a
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
month they put the uniform on so the
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
guard has so there are about uh I think
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's about I don't have the numbers off
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
top of my head I'm sorry I'm Rusty so
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you approximate
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
numbers please bear with me there are
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
about a thousand air Guardsmen right and
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
there are about 1700 Army Guardsmen all
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
of those folks that wear a uniform all
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
of them whether they're one they're
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
weakened or we call them traditional
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
drilling reservists or drilling
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen or they're full-time and they
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
can be in a couple of statuses they can
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
be in an active Garden Reserve status
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
they can be a title 32 technician status
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
all of them that wear a uniform receive
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
their pay from the federal government
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
all of them none of them now there are
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
the only two people that work directly
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
for the state every day uh or me and the
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
edge in general and the engine generals
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
only in the military on this week my
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
last question for the committee just so
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
you understand and I've been on this
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee for 15 years and one of my uh
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
the best chairman I've ever had in this
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
committee was representative Chris
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
Roberts here who was retired Marine
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
lieutenant colonel we served in the
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
Marines together and he was one of the
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
did his homework and he actually I was
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
reading a write-up on him back in 2008
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
but anyways is Chris still serves
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
veterans right yes he's doing a great
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
job helping them and Chris was a
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
Democrat and him and I worked hand in
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
hand in many bills so is Democrat Anna
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
marine and you still like it right yeah
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't hold I don't hold it
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
against them you know but he he's uh
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
honorable honorable guy one of the best
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
I've ever met but anyways my question is
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
basically for you to answer for the
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
committee is on the um
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
geez now I lost where I was going with
 
01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
this here on on The Bachelor that you
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
have uh that activate
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
at any given time you only deploy
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
50 is that still correct or uh maintain
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
a force to maintain for emergencies no
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
no that that's not necessarily true so
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
we we deploy our soldiers based on the
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
combatant Commander's need so if they
 
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
need forces and we have them and we get
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
tasks to deploy them we will deploy them
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
right so there is no ratio for us
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're gonna we're only
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
gonna deploy 50 this week and 50 that
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
week historically historically our
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
deployments have been less than 50 of
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
our total Force historically they have
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
been less than 50 percent of our total
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
force and I think deployments are going
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
to continue to be
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
less right not more less and less you
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
know unless there's unless some other
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
contingency comes up we're gonna we're
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
gonna be pretty pretty pretty pretty
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
level or less in our numbers of
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
deployments uh
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
yes sir I think that should answer your
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
question yeah that does answer I just
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify something on that yeah
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming here and I
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh making life a little
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
easier on sending us your
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
um write-ups on different bills and very
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of work you put into them yes and
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for the work the
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
committee does on behalf of veterans
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
that stay in New Hampshire thank you
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay we don't have any more nope okay
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1092 and the next one is
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
you notice I don't pick on the army of
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
the Air Force too bad I try to go easy
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.299 --> 01:07:24.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.289 align:start position:0%
 
1106.

01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.299 --> 01:07:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
Warren are you speaking are you going to
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
you have somebody that's going to
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
okay good because the reason I'm asking
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
because I only have two cards on this
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
next bill and I think it's very
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
important so I'm going to explain what
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
you're already doing and what we've done
 
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
wait here let me uh
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not changing the name of the
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
day yeah it's uh calling it remembrance
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
a in a proclamation there for that day
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
Veterans Day is designed for those
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
Veterans of living
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day is designed for those that
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
made the ultimate sacrifice all right so
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the only ones
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
hey that's it
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
because we only did two bills
 
01:10:02.169 --> 01:10:02.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I love Steve Charlotte but
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
the thing is the change is back to
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
Remembrance Day world but it's not
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
yeah well he's he's wants a proclamation
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
call and Remembrance Day in New
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the hearing on
 
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:28.100 align:start position:0%

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.189 align:start position:0%

and also besides honorable members we
 
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.169 align:start position:0%
and also besides honorable members we
have

01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
Dr Lundgren here today so that's it's
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
my my idea on this bill
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
is that I think
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
people that are coming out of the
 
01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
people that are coming out of the
service

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
no matter which branch and no matter how
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
long they've been in the service
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
have skills
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
that really fit in with
 
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
what we have or not a need for here in
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
and

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think that New Hampshire has a great
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
story to be told
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
that the people that are in the service
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
would look to New Hampshire as a very
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
favorable place
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
to relocate
 
01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:12.370 align:start position:0%
to relocate
um

01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:12.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
the if a person is getting out of the
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
service depending on how long they've
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
been in
 
01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.290 align:start position:0%
been in
they

01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:20.300 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:24.179 align:start position:0%
have really three choices
 
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
to relocate to they can relocate back to
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
their home of our origin
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
they can stay where they are maybe they
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
have Roots now
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
if they get out of the Navy in Norfolk
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps they have a job that they can go
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
to or they can go to a completely
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
different place
 
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I really want to Target
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
those people
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
who are either
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
native to New Hampshire or they're
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
looking for a place to resettle to move
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
their family
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
and I use myself as a
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
as an example of someone
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
I joined the Navy off the farm in the
 
01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
I joined the Navy off the farm in the
Midwest

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
Midwest
 
01:36:20.169 --> 01:36:20.179 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a lot of
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
possibilities there
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
I was not I lived on a farm but I really
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
didn't like to be a farmer
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
I joined the Navy and spent 10 years in
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
the submarine service
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
and before I went in I talked to a
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
recruiter and I said
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
what should I go into in the Navy
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh and he said one of two things either
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
go into computers or nuclear power
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
now this was in 1969
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I had I couldn't even spell computer
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
I had no idea what nuclear power was
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
but I ended up getting involved in both
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
of those because I served on nuclear
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
submarines I got out after 10 years
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
with a lot of really good experience and
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
I could have relocated anywhere in the
 
01:37:18.719 --> 01:37:20.570 align:start position:0%
I could have relocated anywhere in the
country

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I really did not want to go back to
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
Illinois and I didn't want to stay where
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
I was
 
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
so I got a job at Wang labs in Lowell
 
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.350 align:start position:0%
so I got a job at Wang labs in Lowell
Mass

01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
and I didn't want to live in
 
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at that time it was called
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
taxa juices
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that was in 1979 so I spent 10 years
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
in the service so I moved to New
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and have lived in Litchfield
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
which I represent here ever since
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
and I feel as if I have died and gone to
 
01:37:57.179 --> 01:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
and I feel as if I have died and gone to
heaven

01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
heaven
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
now the idea
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
like I said before
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
is that I feel that New Hampshire really
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
has a good story to be told
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of people
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the service who would love to
 
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
relocate to this state
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of you are fans of a
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
of an Animal Planet show called
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
Northwoods law any of you seen
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
Northwoods law Northwoods law I think
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
is like the New Hampshire Chamber of
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
Commerce it really puts New Hampshire in
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
good light
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
I have talked to a number of people and
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
I say we should be advertising on
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
northwood's law because somebody that's
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
watching that now not everybody but some
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who watch that say wow
 
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
what a nice place
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's not only beautiful and it has all
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
kinds of things to offer but the people
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
are nice too
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
and so my idea
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
is that we need to get our story out
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
we need to Market New Hampshire
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
now as I've gotten into this I have
 
01:39:26.639 --> 01:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
now as I've gotten into this I have
learned

01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
learned
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
that in almost every military
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
installation there's a group there's a
 
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.810 align:start position:0%
installation there's a group there's a
function

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
that assists people that are getting out
 
01:39:39.719 --> 01:39:41.149 align:start position:0%
that assists people that are getting out
to

01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're getting out of the
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
service to prepare them for getting out
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the case when when I got out
 
01:39:51.239 --> 01:39:52.490 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the case when when I got out
but

01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is to have some sort
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
of presence
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
in as many of those places as possible
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
that tells the New Hampshire story
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
um with with respect to
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
skills that I think we should be looking
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
for it's not it's not concentrated in
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
either the public sector or the private
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
sector both can make use of this
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
and I think when legislative Services
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
they sort of said certain certain
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
members of of the service
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not restricting I I don't wish to
 
01:40:41.689 --> 01:40:41.699 align:start position:0%
restrict it to anybody but I must say
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
that here in New Hampshire
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
we are not a very diverse community
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're almost all white let's
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
face it
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
and I was
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
I was
 
01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.050 align:start position:0%
I was
alarmed

01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
alarmed
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
when the former police chief in Nashua a
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
friend of mine
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
told me in the city of Nashville almost
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand people that is a
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
fairly diverse community
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
there is there wasn't at least at that
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
point and that was only like a couple of
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
years ago there were zero
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
African-American police
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
on the force
 
01:41:24.719 --> 01:41:26.890 align:start position:0%
on the force
now

01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:26.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
I believe in in
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
hiring the best person for the job but
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
We should strive
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the police force to reflect the
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
community that they serve
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
and you know we should have black and
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
brown members
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
of certainly Nashua and Manchester the
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
State Police in almost every case
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
there there are very few members
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
that are people of color
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a problem
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
so what I would say
 
01:42:10.619 --> 01:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
so what I would say
is

01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
the service people
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
expands our Horizons
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
with respect to who we're recruiting
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
there are military police
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
in the in the forces Air Forces the
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
Marines the Army and so forth and
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
certainly there's a lot of those folks
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
that are people of color
 
01:42:41.709 --> 01:42:41.719 align:start position:0%
and I would love to for them to consider
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a place to to
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh resettle to
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a great thing
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
with respect to health care workers
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
I mean with this coven thing it really
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
has put them magnifying glass but in
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
almost every sector both private and
 
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.850 align:start position:0%
almost every sector both private and
public

01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
we are in real need for
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
people to come here now we have other
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
issues with respect to housing and so
 
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:16.820 align:start position:0%
forth I'm not touching that but
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
the goal of this is to figure out how
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
can

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
get our story out there the Live Free or
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
Die story needs to be in front of every
 
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
single veteran
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
who leaves
 
01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
the service
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
that story needs to be there and they
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
might maybe they watched northwood's law
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe they said wow what a nice
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
place to live and play and work
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
and if we had our story out there
 
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think that we could recruit that and
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
from from our standpoint
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
having veterans in New Hampshire
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a veteran friendly
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
place we have a high per capita if it's
 
01:44:19.209 --> 01:44:19.219 align:start position:0%
not one of the if it's not the greatest
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
number of veterans in the State uh we're
 
01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:25.820 align:start position:0%
very close to it
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
and we have a veteran I've been talking
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
with Amy who I believe is going to
 
01:44:32.219 --> 01:44:33.530 align:start position:0%
with Amy who I believe is going to
testify

01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
the business Community is very veteran
 
01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.050 align:start position:0%
the business Community is very veteran
friendly

01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:44:48.850 --> 01:44:48.860 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's uh it's a true
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
win-win-win situation
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be happy to take any
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%

retain young people in the state about
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh possibly like their interest in this
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
committee um because I think I think
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
their knowledge would be certainly be
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
helpful have you talked to them I have
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
not taught I'm aware of that there is
 
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
such a committee uh but I I have not
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
talked to them personally but if I may
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
ask I'd like to turn the tables where
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
were you from originally
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
um go ahead I'll let that go we're not
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
we want to move along things originally
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
from Orange County California so okay I
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time there's a marine El
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
Toro and Tustin but uh okay
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
um any other questions
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh for taking my question
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony thanks for
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
your service to our country
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you have considered
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh this as this legislation to be a
 
01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:41.780 align:start position:0%
commission uh where you could bring
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from across the state from
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
higher ed from private business from the
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire together to
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
develop the strategies if I may uh
 
01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
interject you we're going to have Amy
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's going to be coming up who runs
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
the program and she will probably be
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question better on
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh whether Commission on whether the
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
study is beneficial for the uh National
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
Guard that we have here so I'd hold that
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
question until uh she comes up
 
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
any other yes go ahead can I just follow
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
up and I guess the reason that I that I
 
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:19.580 align:start position:0%
bring this up is uh we developed a
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
bipartisan commission uh in the last
 
01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:25.100 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh focused on
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining civilian
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
national service members through
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
Americorps and the Peace Corps some of
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
those recommendations are being
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
introduced as legislation this year
 
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and would be happy to share some of
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
our findings and strategies because I
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that the kind of service driven
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
community-minded young people to help
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
power our Workforce into the future is
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
something that crosses military and
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
civilian national service lines and I
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of opportunity to
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
collaborate and learn from each other
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you any other questions
 
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh representative
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
I was wondering have you spoken with the
 
01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:06.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
regarding what they might be doing
 
01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
already to to um to have this process
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
going I haven't I I know there are
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
various things in place
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I haven't spoken spoken to the
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor but one of the
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
things that I anticipate is that we have
 
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
to figure out what is already in place
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that we don't reinvent the wheel
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
but I have not spoken to the Department
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%

representative shells and this is an
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
area where we need workers and so this
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
is a great topic my question is similar
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
to his uh and maybe the next speaker
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
could touch on this but uh have you been
 
01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
in touch with anyone from the Department
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
of resources and economic development
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing I've done there
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
as I fired off an email saying why
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
aren't we advertising on northwood's law
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
the only thing I've done
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative for taking me a question
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
um in the bill it says you know that you
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
were going to look at offering
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
incentives by employers to
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
offer incentives to employers for hiring
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
vets do you have any examples of what
 
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
might be an incentive
 
01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.370 align:start position:0%
might be an incentive
um

01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
the the idea that I have but all of this
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
has to be developed through the
 
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
commission but is to provide incentives
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
such in the in the area of Education or
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
I can Envision someone uh getting a
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
break with respect to their tuition I I
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
know that representative baltazaro has
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
said that we now allow State uh our
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition to the state uh you
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
know I I would like to see incentives in
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
that way working with employers I know
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
Amy's going to speak about some of the
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
things that employers are currently
 
01:50:32.649 --> 01:50:32.659 align:start position:0%
doing in the way of incentives but
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
whatever makes economic sense to me
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
would be good thank you I represent
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
Perez before you go if I may just keep
 
01:50:46.129 --> 01:50:46.139 align:start position:0%
in mind the duty experts going to be
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
coming up in a few minutes which will be
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
Amy after Kevin Grady and she's she's
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to advise and let you know what
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've been doing and how this is working
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
and why this is a win-win there's bill
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
for the state and that would help out so
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind because it's we got
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
about 12 more minutes and we want to
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
move along but go ahead representative
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for uh for taking my
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
question my question to you is and your
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
testimony money you say that we need
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
more diversity in New Hampshire
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
how do you see this bill or this
 
01:51:20.209 --> 01:51:20.219 align:start position:0%
committee helping us to bring more
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
diversity into New Hampshire
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
we you know we we know we that we have a
 
01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:26.900 align:start position:0%
lot of people they wanted to move here
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh with uh different backgrounds and
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
different cultures and how do you see
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
this bill helping us to bring more of
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
these more of the people to divert New
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here okay thank you very much
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the for the question a couple of
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
different ways one we expand the pool
 
01:51:47.649 --> 01:51:47.659 align:start position:0%
all right if we restrict ourselves to
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
only people who have lived here for 20
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
years you're not going to have a lot but
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
if we expand the pool we will get more
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is I'm trying to
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can get the ethnic
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
churches involved okay because there
 
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
there is a very active uh
 
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
religious community on the ethnic side
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
if we could get them involved then I
 
01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
think that would be good
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I can
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
um um I'm more than inhabited at 202 to
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
to work with you as well I'm the chair
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
of the Latino caucus and you know we
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
have some information and maybe you have
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
some information that it can help us as
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any other
 
01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any other
questions

01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
I I thank you representative uh Joe uh
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen the committee once
 
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Kevin
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
Grady 25-year Air Force veteran 22-year
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
veteran of Hooksett I'm here
 
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
representing the state veterans advisory
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
committee and thank heavens a bill we
 
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
support we support this one it will be
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
supporting a few more that you'll hear
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
today as well but we do support this
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill the only thing and and I don't want
 
01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:22.139 align:start position:0%
to take too much time away from the
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
experts are going to testify after me
 
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
but the only thing that we saw in this
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill is it the title it says recruit
 
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
certain veterans
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
and that the implication there is we'd
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
like these veterans but these veterans
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
over here not so much
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
um so we'd like to have you take the
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
word certain out of there and just say
 
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
recruit veterans and if if the committee
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you put together wants to Target
 
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
certain communities for certain skill
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
sets that we need in New Hampshire
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's all great but but the idea is we
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
are a veteran friendly State and that
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
that word needs to get out and that's
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
really a subject to your questions
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to say all right
 
01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you on your recommendation there
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%

01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%

submit some written testimony and I'm
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to take just a minute to read
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
through it because I think it sets the
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
stage for my follow-up thoughts that I
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
think will also answer some of the
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%

01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
can be taken without further legislation
 
01:55:47.209 --> 01:55:47.219 align:start position:0%
to develop and promote these
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities and number three develop
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations and proposed legislation
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
designed to increase the acceptance of
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
military training and experience towards
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
professional licensing
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
the position created by the department
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for these requirements
 
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
was just recently filled in December
 
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
2021 December 3rd to be exact the
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
department has taken action to start
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
meeting the requirements set in House
 
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 1582 and has determined that there
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
are potentially a great number of
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities in the state to increase
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
the acceptance of military training and
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
experience towards Professional
 
01:56:28.850 --> 01:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
Licensing a legislatively established
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
committee could help prioritize these
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist and provide
 
01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
input regarding the development of those
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
that could also exist in the future the
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services would like to request
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
representation on the committee
 
01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
established to study recruiting former
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
members of the Armed Forces two job
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities within the state and
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
obviously would welcome the opportunity
 
01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
to provide input to the committee we
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that the committee
 
01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
considers supporting this bill
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have so off the Record so the part
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's not in the written testimony is
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
that even in just a few three weeks
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
since the new position was filled we've
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
taken a lot of different steps to
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
start the framework for this talking
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
with people around the state about what
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
exists already what exists nationally
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we could bring to New Hampshire how
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
to promote that there's some things that
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
exist that people don't know exist and
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find information on the
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
internet about so taking all of that
 
01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:35.219 align:start position:0%
promoting it better educating people
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
about those opportunities and then
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
really starting to look at where could
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
we fill some gaps in the different
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
Workforce sectors that we have we also
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
in July summer of 2020 we launched the
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veteran friendly business
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%

01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%

01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
60 businesses that are recognized as
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
veteran friendly businesses in New

talk about a national recruit campaign
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%

01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%

scheduled next week to talk about where
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
we might overlap and align our efforts
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
and kind of take the Synergy into the
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%

um you know a few years ago I passed I
 
01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
sponsored legislation on uh with the
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
yellow ribbon program on any veterans
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
from around the country coming into the
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
state once they get an apartment they
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
automatically qualify as a resident and
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
they get in-state tuition at our
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
universities have you heard getting
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
feedback on how that is working on
 
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.139 align:start position:0%
attracting veterans and are they coming
 
01:59:31.139 --> 01:59:31.970 align:start position:0%

01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
I don't have information about how
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's working that's kind of out of my
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
field that I focus on however it's
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
definitely been in my mind that as we go
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
through this National recruitment
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
campaign those are the types of things
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we want to highlight you know
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
because they those types of benefits
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
um not just why New Hampshire is a great
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
place but why it's a great place for you
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
as a military family you as someone
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
transitioning out of the military to
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire okay another
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
question here and I'm only asking these
 
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
questions for the benefit of new veteran
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
new reps that are on the committee here
 
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
we passed legislation also a while ago
 
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
on licensing and credentialing you
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
brought that up and we're and we also
 
02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:17.219 align:start position:0%
have which I sponsored we also added in
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
spouses that are moving into the state
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
have you does that helped at all on the
 
02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
recruitment in other areas there for
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
veterans coming in to maybe join the
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
National Guard yes so one of the great
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
benefits of that a pause positive
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
outcome of that is that it certainly
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
brought it to the Forefront in
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
conversations so in the New Hampshire
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
veteran friendly business Network that
 
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
we have we're often talking about it's
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
not just the veteran you know we want to
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
come live here we want their entire
 
02:00:50.169 --> 02:00:50.179 align:start position:0%
family to be employed here as well
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
Service Credit Union is one of the
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
businesses that we work with and after
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
discussing that in the beginning they
 
02:00:59.930 --> 02:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
shared with us that that prompted them
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
to have discussions at their business
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
about how to bring more military spouses
 
02:01:05.689 --> 02:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
into their Workforce and so they've
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
created a whole entire strategic plan
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
around doing that so it's definitely
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
it brought the conversation forward and
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's been highlighted in a lot of
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
different ways so I think that there are
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
some results that are now starting to
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
happen from that outstanding thank you
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions remember
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%

02:01:27.169 --> 02:01:27.179 align:start position:0%
wondering how well thank you for taking
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
my question thank you Mr chairman for
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
recognizing me how close is your office
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
and your department work with the
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to upskiller reskill workers
 
02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:36.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to upskiller reskill workers
and

02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
um would your department be you know
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the future continuing that
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
effort and maybe concentrating more on a
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know re retooling and reskilling
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
Veterans coming to this state thank you
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
yes so they're definitely
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
part of that puzzle right like they're a
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
puzzle piece to that entire conversation
 
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
so as the staff who we've just hired
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
who's starting starting to sift through
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
what opportunities are out there
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and does and figure out what else do
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
we want to do they're going to be a
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
major piece of that conversation because
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunities there
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
that exist already and can be promoted
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
through all of this but I think that
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
they also hold a key to things that can
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
continue to be developed
 
02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.050 align:start position:0%
continue to be developed
yeah

02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
um Amy um something that popped to my
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
head right now we put in a line item uh
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
for retention and helping veterans uh
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
National Guard to 25
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
000 line item is that still there that
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get taken out of the budget I'm
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
open Warren nod yes or no is that money
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
still there for the veterans
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay good and the reason
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
for I mean for National God I'm right so
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
my question is and I haven't seen a
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
board I thought I was on that board and
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
I haven't we haven't had one in a while
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted because that was
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
another tool that we did for retention
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
to help and with recruitment well and
 
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
that'll definitely be the idea of
 
02:03:10.609 --> 02:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
National Guard right so that'll be one
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
of those
 
02:03:14.050 --> 02:03:14.060 align:start position:0%
Espionage National recruitment campaign
 
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
is as we're asking people to come here
 
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know also think about serving in the
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
National Guard when you come here you
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
know if you're at a point in your life
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
when you're you still want to serve you
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
still can serve and you have interest in
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
doing that that'll be one of those
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
puzzle pieces that will attach thank you
 
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:34.380 align:start position:0%

when I got out of the service and and

program or taps and they they sent us
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
there and we went through and there was
 
02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses and a lot of of
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
different Flyers that were presented to
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
us do we have anything going right now
 
02:04:08.589 --> 02:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
with the active duty military branches
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
to get our information into those Taps
 
02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
programs so that we have good
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
communication of hey here we are and and
 
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd like to think about coming
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
here the seeds have been planted
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
so yes we have started talking with them
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
um just like you said that there's
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
businesses that are that get into that
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge I believe we're
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to be the first state to have a
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide effort
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
programs that are out there to the
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%

program that goes around the country
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
um we're again to my knowledge we're
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
going to be the first state that has
 
02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:51.540 align:start position:0%

legislation is so I'm just going to read
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
his letter into the record

and helped run this Cemetery after his
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
father left active service duty if I'm
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
not mistaken so for representative Valor
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very um this Veteran Cemetery
 
02:07:53.209 --> 02:07:53.219 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a uh one of the best
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
run in the country it's very important
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
to him and it's important to Veterans

colleagues due to a positive covid test
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%

supposed to introduce House Bill 1256
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
instead representative Terry Roy is

expected to introduce the bill
 
02:08:20.930 --> 02:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
if something unforeseen detains reproy
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%

02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
similar facilities around the country it
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
is a source of justifiable pride in New
 
02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of great comfort to
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%

and I hope you will be able to advance
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
it quickly to the Full House thank you
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully representative J.C Ellard
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh Pittsburgh pits Pittsfield and epsom
 
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
and um with that I think the adjutant
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
general can probably do better Justice
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
than me to explain all the changes
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
within this bill it's a pretty long bill
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of broken down into three
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
parts by the office of legislative
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
services so I will not yield to any
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you uh
 
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative I agree with you there
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman did you recognize
 
02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:39.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman did you recognize
um

02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
Kevin Grady for a quick uh support the
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
bill from the svac and then we'll go
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman once again for the
 
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
record Kevin Grady uh 25-year Air Force
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
veteran 23-year resident of Hooksett New
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing the state
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
um we unanimously support this bill to
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
be honest with all of you we were
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
frankly shocked that these folks were
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
not on a salary but were in fact hourly
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
wage earners when we found out that uh
 
02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
Sean buck and Amy Cook were were in fact
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
in that in that other category to speak
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
just from my personal experience I know
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
that that Sean Buck out at the cemetery
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
works a lot of Saturdays because I was
 
02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
there with him on a Saturday back in
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
November when my Association of
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
graduates of the Air Force Academy group
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
went out there and and cleaned
 
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
gravestones and he was out there with a
 
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
few of his folks in the morning
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and I I've also seen
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh Amy Cook at our state veterans
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
advisory committee giving testimony all
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
of these kind of things fall outside the
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
normal nine to five office hours and we
 
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
think it is in fact appropriate to put
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
these people on a salary instead of an
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
hour hourly wage and again that's that's
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
all I want to say is that we've active
 
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
we've enthusiastically support this and
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry can get down into the nuts
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Kevin are there any
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much sir with that I
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
welcome once again uh Deputy adjun
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record Warren
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
Perry Deputy Edge and General New
 
02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services the
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
department clearly supports the bill
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
since we requested that uh
 
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Roy representative Allard
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the esteemed colleague from this
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
morning here are sponsoring uh
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the legislation really what
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
this gets to is two things from our
 
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
perspective I provided some written
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
testimony in advance via email that you
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
may have seen and I've just given the
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
clerk copies to distribute but two
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
things really the first thing is
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the the state's personal
 
02:11:52.089 --> 02:11:52.099 align:start position:0%
classification system the hourly wage
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
and punching a Time Clock system is not
 
02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
very Nimble it's it's really very rigid
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
and both Amy Cook who is the
 
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
administrator for community-based
 
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
military programs who you heard a little
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
earlier today and Sean Buck who directs
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
the cemetery work a lot a ton of off
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
schedule hours
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
so that requires an administrative
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
burden for us to be able to manage comp
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
time over time making sure that time
 
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
cards are correct and it's not really
 
02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
commensurate with their duties they're
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
Bound by this time clock when they
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
really should be free away from the time
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
clock to be able to perform their duties
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the second thing is uh in 2000 uh
 
02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:39.290 align:start position:0%
the second thing is uh in 2000 uh
19

02:12:39.290 --> 02:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
19
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 110b was amended to create the
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
veteran services from what was then the
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
adjutant generals Department The Edge
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
and Generals Department really had the
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
cemetery and the military Affairs piece
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
when we assumed the responsibility to
 
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
administer in the department the rest of
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Affairs piece
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
we received Amy's division from the
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
and we we took control of the division
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
then the office of veteran services now
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
the division of Veterans Services
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the time we did that the director of
 
02:13:14.569 --> 02:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
the division Veterans Services was in
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
the unclassified system so now we have
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
three directors essentially one in the
 
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
classified system or two in the
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
classified system and one in the
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
unclassified system and the pay is not
 
02:13:24.659 --> 02:13:26.209 align:start position:0%
unclassified system and the pay is not
necessarily

02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
equal not that it would necessarily
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
always be equal but it's not necessarily
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
commensurate so what this bill does
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
really is it moves those two key
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
positions uh the administrator for uh
 
02:13:40.129 --> 02:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
division of community-based military
 
02:13:41.930 --> 02:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
programs and the cemetery director into
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
the unclassified position creates parity
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
in the department for our division
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
directors in terms of their work
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
schedules and closer to their pay we
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
won't know that until we get through the
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
entire process and it allows the
 
02:13:57.410 --> 02:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
adjutant general and me to administer
 
02:13:59.450 --> 02:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
veterans programs
 
02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.290 align:start position:0%
veterans programs
flexibly

02:14:02.290 --> 02:14:02.300 align:start position:0%
flexibly
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that concludes
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any uh questions
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay this this here for the committee is
 
02:14:15.770 --> 02:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
an early build and I have a couple of
 
02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
questions on the finance idea
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
because this bill more likely will be
 
02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to finance I think it has to go
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
also to the Joint Committee on the Edna
 
02:14:26.569 --> 02:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
yeah you know as you go to Joint
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
Committee on employee classification as
 
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
well yeah I don't know but I just know
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill right and when it had
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
when it has an FN normally you know
 
02:14:34.139 --> 02:14:35.270 align:start position:0%
when it has an FN normally you know
Finance

02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay my question is on a salary like for
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
instance uh when this passes I guess
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be effective in uh fiscal year
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
2023 right but uh 48 000 what does that
 
02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
mean so the 48 000 includes the payoff
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
to to because there will be there are
 
02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
benefits earned that when they leave the
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
classified system have to be paid out so
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
that calculates not only the increase in
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
salary but also the cost of the payout
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
for benefits okay so there is an
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
increase in I I take it in anticipation
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
in anticipate so the fiscal note that
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
the department wrote was based on where
 
02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
we thought that the position would fall
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the unclassified position so
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
commensurate with what uh what the
 
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
division of veteran services has we
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
figured that would be in the CC band of
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the unclassified system which starts at
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
step one at about 61 000 and ends at
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
step seven at about 84 000.
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
so we uh we anticipated somewhere around
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
step four in that system but that won't
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
be determined until a study is done with
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
a recommendation of where that falls so
 
02:15:41.629 --> 02:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
our estimate is based on that so I take
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
right okay I was just wondering what
 
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
that cost I'm sorry I didn't mean to get
 
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
into the nuts and bolts I thought that's
 
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
where you're going but it's but no
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to understand here
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
so in case I'm asked from Finance or
 
02:15:59.930 --> 02:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
someone else you know that I I got an
 
02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
idea because I'll have to brief the bill
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
right and I know where I'm going okay
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you uh thank you again for
 
02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:47.099 align:start position:0%

and uh in about two minutes or so we're
 
02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
going to exec this bill and then a
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
couple other bills there and get them
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%

I'm here today for your consideration to
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
Bill authorizing the state guard
 
04:03:28.260 --> 04:03:29.030 align:start position:0%
Bill authorizing the state guard
um

04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
when I wrote this bill after speaking
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
with many other members of the House
 
04:03:37.969 --> 04:03:37.979 align:start position:0%
we had an interest in somehow allowing
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
veterans who who have separated from
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
service and other form of law
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to use their
 
04:03:45.889 --> 04:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
training experience and to continue to
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
contribute and help
 
04:03:51.050 --> 04:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
help the members of the the citizens of
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:03:55.490 --> 04:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
in some capacity since Drafting and
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
submitting the bill I've spoken to
 
04:03:59.689 --> 04:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
several members of the State National
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
Guard and state veterans organizations
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they explained to me that while this
 
04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
is a good idea the way it's written
 
04:04:12.410 --> 04:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
um would be very expensive and they're
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
they couldn't support it
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
so after having that discussion with
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
them they did agree to speak to me and
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
work with me on somehow coming up with a
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
feasible program that we would be able
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
to put that experience and training to
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
use so we're going to continue to work
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
on that and based on that
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm in the ironic position of asking
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
this is a lot a bill that I've supported
 
04:04:47.090 --> 04:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
a while ago long time in
 
04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I honestly believe that we should
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
have something in but as this keeps
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
coming forward I learn more and more
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the state like in my
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
town we have what you call alert team in
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
other towns they have these teams that
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
like that go out and they're trained and
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know Medical in carrying
 
04:05:09.000 --> 04:05:09.769 align:start position:0%
you know Medical in carrying
um

04:05:09.769 --> 04:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know emergency getting people out of
 
04:05:14.330 --> 04:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
the woods and things uh the alert team
 
04:05:16.610 --> 04:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
in my which is now called the uh I'm
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
trying to think of what they call it now
 
04:05:20.450 --> 04:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
but anyways
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
emergency response yeah and they trained
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
on going out and they've gone out on
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
searches out in the mountains and other
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
stuff and in the woods for lost kids and
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
other things there they're called upon
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
each City's entire many cities and towns
 
04:05:35.809 --> 04:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
are already maintaining names and
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
numbers so I learned a lot here and I
 
04:05:40.849 --> 04:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
know the National Guard has already over
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
and over said they don't have the time
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
to maintain lists I'll do the training
 
04:05:47.210 --> 04:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
or go through the Surplus because we
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
were questioning on the uniforms and
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
other things there or organization I'm
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
bringing this up so the committee
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
understands what's been going on for a
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
long time here with this here I mean in
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
the Constitution talks about on the
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
militia it goes into it we do have
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislation a law is already on the
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
books on this here you know the militia
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
but just get it over the hurdle to move
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
forward with it the support's just not
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
there and I and I see it because it has
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
been coming to me many times you know
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
here so I respect that I was going to do
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
an interim study there but you requested
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
an Ito then I'd go with that and uh yeah
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's no shame in admitting that your
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
bill just isn't working well and I admit
 
04:06:32.450 --> 04:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
this isn't workable at this time I mean
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
I wish there's something because during
 
04:06:36.650 --> 04:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
disasters it's a no-brainer especially
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
if our national God is deployed and you
 
04:06:41.330 --> 04:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
know it offsets and helps out and we're
 
04:06:43.729 --> 04:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
but I I keep hearing from communities
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this the only thing
 
04:06:48.769 --> 04:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
is the communities are running it not
 
04:06:51.769 --> 04:06:51.779 align:start position:0%
the state are there any questions or
 
04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%

I brought forward
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.680 --> 04:07:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
attention

04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:07:39.000 --> 04:07:42.650 align:start position:0%
attention
spam

04:07:42.650 --> 04:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
what I have brought forth was much more
 
04:07:48.110 --> 04:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
extensive than this all this what this
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill does is authorize or require
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
actually because right now it's
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
permissive it required would require the
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
adjutant general to create a Cadre of
 
04:07:58.859 --> 04:08:00.769 align:start position:0%
adjutant general to create a Cadre of
officers

04:08:00.769 --> 04:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
officers
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
I would have when I scoped it out it
 
04:08:06.050 --> 04:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
would be about 14 commissioned officers
 
04:08:08.530 --> 04:08:08.540 align:start position:0%
and approximately equal number of
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
non-commissioned officers to just form
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the core of what could be a state
 
04:08:14.760 --> 04:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
the the core of what could be a state
guard

04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
guard
 
04:08:19.130 --> 04:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
State guards are something that exist in
 
04:08:21.610 --> 04:08:21.620 align:start position:0%
23 of the states
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
some of them are social club some of
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
them are very effective organizations
 
04:08:30.410 --> 04:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons one of the advantages
 
04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
of the state guard is because they are
 
04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
local they're Town based they deploy out
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
of their town
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
their response time is much faster than
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the National Guard
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
National Guard has a requirement of
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
responding in 72 hours National Guards
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
typically respond in less than 12 hours
 
04:08:52.969 --> 04:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
Texas uses them to be the first men on
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
the scene
 
04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
so they they deploy they see the
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
situation they report back to the
 
04:09:02.210 --> 04:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
National Guard do you need to come if
 
04:09:03.769 --> 04:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
you do come what do you need to bring
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
04:09:07.849 --> 04:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
um and I've had extensive conversations
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
with them with this Texas State guard
 
04:09:12.889 --> 04:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
State guards New England New York
 
04:09:15.130 --> 04:09:15.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh New York and and Massachusetts are
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
long-standing organizations Vermont
 
04:09:24.530 --> 04:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
state guard was created after 2001 in
 
04:09:25.929 --> 04:09:25.939 align:start position:0%
response to it
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh the New York State guard in 911 they
 
04:09:32.809 --> 04:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
were the first people on site
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
before the National Guard just as you
 
04:09:35.889 --> 04:09:35.899 align:start position:0%
would expect
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
event they handled all of the traffic
 
04:09:41.279 --> 04:09:42.590 align:start position:0%
event they handled all of the traffic
control

04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:09:42.600 --> 04:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
control
around

04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:09:46.250 --> 04:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
the the site that meant the National
 
04:09:48.110 --> 04:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
Guard didn't have to do it they did all
 
04:09:51.250 --> 04:09:51.260 align:start position:0%
of their work of cleanup
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh things out of the wreckage and the
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
police were allowed to do their normal
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
policing functions outside of the site
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
that so that there was no additional
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
burden put on the city police due to you
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
know the the after effects of 9 11. so
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is there is a slot for it
 
04:10:12.000 --> 04:10:12.950 align:start position:0%
there is there is a slot for it
um

04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
it does need to be thought out
 
04:10:14.580 --> 04:10:16.070 align:start position:0%
it does need to be thought out
extensively

04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
04:10:18.050 --> 04:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
when I put the bills in one of the
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
things I did was make them much more
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
volunteer in nature
 
04:10:25.130 --> 04:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
right now there would be a substance if
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
you just
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
implemented the state guard as it exists
 
04:10:32.090 --> 04:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
in statute today there would be a
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
substantial financial burden upon the
 
04:10:33.720 --> 04:10:35.090 align:start position:0%
substantial financial burden upon the
state

04:10:35.090 --> 04:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you make it truly volunteer
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
you transfer that most of that cost onto
 
04:10:44.090 --> 04:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
the members
 
04:10:46.010 --> 04:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
which if they're inclined to volunteer
 
04:10:48.110 --> 04:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
for it then they'd volunteer for the
 
04:10:48.120 --> 04:10:49.550 align:start position:0%
for it then they'd volunteer for the
expense

04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
expense
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
no questions uh thank you very much
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
we miss you up here there representative
 
04:11:07.969 --> 04:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.979 --> 04:11:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.570 --> 04:11:13.580 align:start position:0%
Terry War you got right okay
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh asked Kevin Grady who opposes the
 
04:11:17.760 --> 04:11:19.610 align:start position:0%
uh asked Kevin Grady who opposes the
bill

04:11:19.610 --> 04:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
from the svac
 
04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
welcome again thank you Mr chairman
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen the committee once
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Kevin
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
Grady I'm a 25-year Air Force veteran uh
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
a 23-year resident of the town of
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hooksett here representing the state
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I can't tell you how happy I
 
04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
am to have representative Roy sit in
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
this chair and say that he really thinks
 
04:11:45.410 --> 04:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not quite ready for
 
04:11:48.530 --> 04:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
prime time because uh representative Roy
 
04:11:49.969 --> 04:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
does a lot of good work for us there's
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's four other bills that he's
 
04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
sponsoring for us that we
 
04:11:56.090 --> 04:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support so we hate to
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
be the people that have to come in and
 
04:12:00.050 --> 04:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
say we don't think this is ready to go
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
so we're very very pleased that I was
 
04:12:03.530 --> 04:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
very pleased to hear him say that it
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
lets me off the hook a little bit our
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
problem with this mostly is that there
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know there's just the administrative
 
04:12:10.969 --> 04:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
burden and the and the money involved
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
just isn't there right now and there are
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
Community emergency response teams that
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
are doing the kinds of things that you
 
04:12:19.370 --> 04:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
might think you know a natural disaster
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
where we've got roads that are washed
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
out or whatever their their local
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
community groups that are already doing
 
04:12:27.410 --> 04:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
that and I think there is some value in
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
trying to pursue this and maybe have a
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
larger umbrella over all of these
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
Community emergency response groups in
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
the various towns that would link it
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
back to the state and at some point in
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
time we would need to try and maybe put
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
some money against this thing so that we
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
could do some training for example just
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
a thought I had off the top of my head
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
every single National Guards person
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's trained to drive one of
 
04:12:52.969 --> 04:12:52.979 align:start position:0%
our vehicles has a license to drive that
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
specific vehicle and has done that
 
04:12:54.359 --> 04:12:55.130 align:start position:0%
specific vehicle and has done that
before

04:12:55.130 --> 04:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
somebody with a CDL license might not
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily be able to drive some of the
 
04:13:00.769 --> 04:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
equipment that the guard has without
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
some training so we we're going to need
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
to train those Folks at some point if
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this and this is it's
 
04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
an interesting job idea and we we
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
actually look forward to working with
 
04:13:13.130 --> 04:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative Roy and and trying to
 
04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
craft something that we think perhaps
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
better meets uh our needs on this that's
 
04:13:19.969 --> 04:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
really all I wanted to say sir thank you
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
04:13:23.450 --> 04:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
no question
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
the Rotary Club in Londonderry
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's where the money's come from
 
04:13:36.840 --> 04:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
that's where the money's come from
mm-hmm

04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
04:13:40.969 --> 04:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:13:43.729 --> 04:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
the small organizations like that
 
04:13:46.250 --> 04:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
well-trained right
 
04:13:49.010 --> 04:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
I agree with you I was actually one of
 
04:13:51.410 --> 04:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
the original members on that on the team

04:49:47.330 --> 04:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
pretty much calmly got a bad deal over
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the Senate there they had a bill that
 
04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
was passed end up being tabled for one
 
04:49:53.448 --> 04:49:53.458 align:start position:0%
reason another on some stuff that was
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
04:49:58.128 --> 04:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
I talked with somebody and I mentioned
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
the names but I did talk with a couple
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
people about some things that they said
 
04:50:05.930 --> 04:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
Barry did when he was the commandant and
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
I talked with Barry and of course uh he
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
swears up and down you know that he'd
 
04:50:12.830 --> 04:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
bring his employment records and
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
everything forward and that it never
 
04:50:16.610 --> 04:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
happened so I wasn't going to get in the
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
tip of that all I know is you know when
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
I see a lot of people that are
 
04:50:23.330 --> 04:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
supporting this I said okay well I'll
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
bring It Forward let me first of all
 
04:50:27.410 --> 04:50:27.420 align:start position:0%

04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%

committee for over 15 years I worked
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
with Barry Conway for many many years I
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%

04:50:40.368 --> 04:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
individual uh Was A Cut Above and really
 
04:50:43.490 --> 04:50:43.500 align:start position:0%

some of his accomplishments uh was
 
04:50:50.690 --> 04:50:50.700 align:start position:0%

04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
um first of all I'll give you he was a
 
04:50:54.050 --> 04:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
chief executive officer senior
 
04:50:55.930 --> 04:50:55.940 align:start position:0%

marketing this is just some of his
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
background he was familiar with Grant
 
04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
and contract development and
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%

04:51:19.798 --> 04:51:20.810 align:start position:0%
testifying on legislation
um

04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
very educated individual operated a
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
budget about 36 million dollars he had
 
04:51:29.770 --> 04:51:29.780 align:start position:0%
about 200 plus personal staff
 
04:51:32.810 --> 04:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know in a 250 I believe it's about
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
250 unit beds I maybe off a few but I
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
think it's 250 if I remember right
 
04:51:42.410 --> 04:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and he did a good job I mean you know
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
the guy was educated
 
04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
um master's degree in public
 
04:51:47.458 --> 04:51:49.030 align:start position:0%
um master's degree in public
administration

04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
as a chairman here before in the vice
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
chair and on this committee never ever
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
did I ever get a complaint in here on
 
04:51:58.730 --> 04:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
Barry Conway that's why I'm kind of
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
surprised when I hear about the bullying
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
and some other stuff that you may hear
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
coming up and I think it's a personal
 
04:52:07.550 --> 04:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
records issue that uh we have to be
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
careful on uh because he swears up and
 
04:52:13.010 --> 04:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
down that that's never happened so I'm
 
04:52:15.050 --> 04:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
not going to get in for a Tit for Tat on
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
this here I'm just concerned there
 
04:52:20.510 --> 04:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
because of my experience Whit Barry has
 
04:52:23.208 --> 04:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
been A Cut Above in
 
04:52:26.330 --> 04:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
I I just thought he did a great great
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
job here I give you an idea
 
04:52:29.340 --> 04:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
job here I give you an idea
um

04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:32.208 --> 04:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
on some of his
 
04:52:33.890 --> 04:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
um you know notable achievements during
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
his time uh he definitely increased
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
resident census From Below uh 100 to
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
almost 200 established an on-site
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy he initiated electronic health
 
04:52:47.570 --> 04:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
record system he established two new
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
positions on the board of managers the
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps League and the Vietnam
 
04:52:53.930 --> 04:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
veterans America he received and
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
developed Capital project grants funded
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
by 65 percent of federal Veterans
 
04:53:01.490 --> 04:53:01.500 align:start position:0%

disease
 
04:53:29.570 --> 04:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I believe at least from what I
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
gather because no complaints ever came
 
04:53:33.530 --> 04:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:53:33.540 --> 04:53:34.310 align:start position:0%
to us
um

04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:36.410 --> 04:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know we boarded you know he worked
 
04:53:37.730 --> 04:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
with the board of manager governing
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
executive council state reps and
 
04:53:40.080 --> 04:53:41.150 align:start position:0%
executive council state reps and
Senators

04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
Senators
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
um you know on the um in the
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation uh throughout
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
the years of him being at the nursing
 
04:53:47.700 --> 04:53:48.590 align:start position:0%
the years of him being at the nursing
home

04:53:48.590 --> 04:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:53:51.050 --> 04:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh and this is why I'm kind of surprised
 
04:53:52.730 --> 04:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the problem was in the
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
Senate but I see him uh this going
 
04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
forward in uh with the support you know
 
04:54:01.550 --> 04:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully with the Senate
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
um you know on this legislation
 
04:54:07.090 --> 04:54:07.100 align:start position:0%
and if Barry was here he was in Florida
 
04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
you know he would be able to sit here
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
and defend himself
 
04:54:13.550 --> 04:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking around here I don't know
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
I think it represents you what is I
 
04:54:18.050 --> 04:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
think at the time when Barry was around
 
04:54:22.368 --> 04:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
and uh you know like I said I was kind
 
04:54:24.650 --> 04:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
of shocked where it didn't you know it
 
04:54:26.650 --> 04:54:26.660 align:start position:0%
didn't pass that's why I did not mind
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
picking this up and bringing it forward
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
now a long time friend of mine who was
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
the VFW committeeman for many years and
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
been in this committee many times Assad
 
04:54:39.650 --> 04:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
major Paul Chevalier he sent me a
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
message and he said to me Al what do we
 
04:54:43.850 --> 04:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
need to do to get this moved uh let me
 
04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
know and I'd be honest with you I
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to write Paul
 
04:54:49.250 --> 04:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
Chevalier back and ask him to submit a
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
letter okay I've been busy here all week
 
04:54:55.128 --> 04:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
on other legislation but um there's also
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
been other letters that you should have
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
gotten to your emails you know on his
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
you know recommending um you know that
 
04:55:06.650 --> 04:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
we support this here you know and people
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
that he's worked with you know on these
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
letters that were submit good
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh Jackie bonafide
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
who's a former NH veterans home program
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
information officer worked for him I
 
04:55:23.930 --> 04:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
wrote a great letter
 
04:55:23.940 --> 04:55:25.910 align:start position:0%
wrote a great letter
um

04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
trying to think here in the other
 
04:55:27.420 --> 04:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
trying to think here in the other
letters

04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
letters
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh like I said this is a you know to me
 
04:55:34.490 --> 04:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
is a no-brainer so I'm hoping and I've
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
seen that we have some kind of people
 
04:55:37.730 --> 04:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
that were against it and
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that here that you know we do
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
the right thing and pass this and uh
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is long overdue on a man a veteran
 
04:55:47.570 --> 04:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
who took charge with the veterans
 
04:55:50.570 --> 04:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
community who in my opinion kept those
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
veteran numbers up
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
okay and even though he didn't have
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
covid you know uh that slowed him down
 
04:56:00.288 --> 04:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
but he made damn well show we were
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
bringing veterans in and filling those
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
beds up at the veterans home so I highly
 
04:56:09.050 --> 04:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
recommend that we uh support this bill
 
04:56:11.810 --> 04:56:11.820 align:start position:0%

getting it in
 
04:56:25.610 --> 04:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll leave it at that and
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:33.410 --> 04:56:33.420 align:start position:0%

be uh Paul Lloyd
 
04:56:59.930 --> 04:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.128 --> 04:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:57:11.330 --> 04:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Paul Lloyd I'm the chairman
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
for the board of managers at the
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
04:57:16.730 --> 04:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
chairman of the state veterans advisory
 
04:57:16.740 --> 04:57:18.170 align:start position:0%
chairman of the state veterans advisory
committee

04:57:18.170 --> 04:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
state adjunate for New Hampshire VFW and
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
currently serving a full year at the
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
national level at the Inspector General
 
04:57:28.440 --> 04:57:29.708 align:start position:0%
national level at the Inspector General
so

04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here for the board of managers the
 
04:57:36.650 --> 04:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
board of managers has voted they do not
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason being is some of the
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
things that we found out after Barry
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
retired now
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
that being said before we go on he did
 
04:57:52.128 --> 04:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
great things while he was commandant
 
04:57:52.138 --> 04:57:53.330 align:start position:0%
great things while he was commandant
um

04:57:53.330 --> 04:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
but after he retired we've learned of
 
04:57:59.208 --> 04:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
some things that were not
 
04:57:59.218 --> 04:58:00.410 align:start position:0%
some things that were not
um

04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:01.730 --> 04:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
we're not good
 
04:58:01.740 --> 04:58:02.448 align:start position:0%
we're not good
um

04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
he was
 
04:58:07.788 --> 04:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
accused of hostile work environment
 
04:58:12.490 --> 04:58:12.500 align:start position:0%
I think in 2007 2008
 
04:58:16.030 --> 04:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
he fired a worker and the labor board
 
04:58:19.070 --> 04:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
agreed with the worker and put her back
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
in a position
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
04:58:24.480 --> 04:58:26.750 align:start position:0%
we also have
unsubstantiated

04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated
 
04:58:30.288 --> 04:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
allegations of sexual harassment
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I say unsubstantiated no one put pen
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
to paper
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
but we were told of instance of sexual
 
04:58:37.798 --> 04:58:40.190 align:start position:0%
but we were told of instance of sexual
harassment

04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
04:58:40.200 --> 04:58:41.390 align:start position:0%
harassment
um

04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why the board of managers do
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.250 --> 04:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony would you
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
take any questions sure yes sir are
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
there any questions for
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.930 --> 04:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
see uh as you were uh representative
 
04:59:02.940 --> 04:59:06.288 align:start position:0%
see uh as you were uh representative
delamis

04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
allegations were up to unsubishi
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
substantiated and no one put pen to
 
04:59:12.770 --> 04:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
paper why even bring that up it's as far
 
04:59:15.890 --> 04:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
as it sounds as though it's hearsay did
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
you speak directly with the woman who
 
04:59:21.530 --> 04:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
claims that she was molested
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
I did
 
04:59:23.040 --> 04:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
I did
um

04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:25.550 --> 04:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
but she's no longer with us that's why
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
there was no pen to paper
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:37.490 --> 04:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.620 --> 05:00:00.288 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:02.690 --> 05:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative balls here I I think is a
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
response to the if you could go to a
 
05:00:08.570 --> 05:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
microphone if you would mind so that you
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I I get the utmost respect my
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
friend Paul Lloyd but making the
 
05:00:19.610 --> 05:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
accusations like this here unstentuated
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh on and this is played on YouTube
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're setting ourselves up for a uh a
 
05:00:27.890 --> 05:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
suit okay so I want to be careful here
 
05:00:29.690 --> 05:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
that the committee the Veterans Affairs
 
05:00:31.550 --> 05:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee has nothing to do with that
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's not on our behalf
 
05:00:35.570 --> 05:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
that it came forward just in case
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
something comes out of this
 
05:00:39.770 --> 05:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
so we brought it up on the record there
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the state of New
 
05:00:43.850 --> 05:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is protected thank you
 
05:00:46.490 --> 05:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the response
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
all right next up on our list is uh
 
05:00:54.530 --> 05:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
who uh also signed in an opposition
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
so for the record on Warren Perry
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
representing myself not the department
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
as in other testimony today I would only
 
05:01:08.270 --> 05:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
say that my experience with
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
memorializing buildings and wings and
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
bridges generally is done posthumously
 
05:01:16.368 --> 05:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge Mr Conway is still
 
05:01:16.378 --> 05:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge Mr Conway is still
alive

05:01:17.350 --> 05:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
alive
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
so I just think it's odd and my
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
opposition is not necessarily based on
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
any testimony you heard here but
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
generally we wait to memorialize things
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
until they're memorialized uh and uh
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's just my feeling based on
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
you know how we name things
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
so subject to your questions that
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
concludes my statement
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question uh chair
 
05:01:49.250 --> 05:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
organized representative wilkowitz thank
 
05:01:49.260 --> 05:01:49.970 align:start position:0%
organized representative wilkowitz thank
you

05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%

05:01:49.980 --> 05:01:51.410 align:start position:0%
you
um

05:01:51.410 --> 05:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to ask you a
 
05:01:53.160 --> 05:01:54.170 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to ask you a
question

05:01:54.170 --> 05:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
um would would delaying this give us
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
some time to also to learn more about
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
this I feel like I'm blindsided here by
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
some by opposition of people who I
 
05:02:08.050 --> 05:02:08.060 align:start position:0%
respect a lot
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
is there what do you think of a delay or
 
05:02:13.030 --> 05:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
in general thank you for thank you for
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
the question representative in general I
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
I always ask this question when people
 
05:02:22.970 --> 05:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
bring to me problems is this a decision
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
that I have to make right now
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I and if the answer is no then I go
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
find out more information and that's
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
generally the litmus test that I use
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to any information you may
 
05:02:35.690 --> 05:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
uncover with regard to the
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of this memorialization
 
05:02:40.730 --> 05:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
of this Wing I mean that's that's really
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh the will of the committee but I try
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
never to rush to failure as a just as a
 
05:02:47.160 --> 05:02:48.050 align:start position:0%
never to rush to failure as a just as a
personal

05:02:48.050 --> 05:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
personal
 
05:02:50.570 --> 05:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh as a personal matter and if I don't
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision right now I
 
05:02:54.530 --> 05:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
generally delay it till I have enough
 
05:02:56.690 --> 05:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
information that leads me to the proper
 
05:02:56.700 --> 05:02:57.890 align:start position:0%
information that leads me to the proper
decision

05:02:57.890 --> 05:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'm not trying to dodge your
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
for uh yes representative
 
05:03:10.970 --> 05:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lawton here my uh
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
question is you had stated
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
um that we normally wait until someone
 
05:03:18.770 --> 05:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
is you know either passed on or whatnot
 
05:03:20.690 --> 05:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
would this be something you would
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
support for this individual you know
 
05:03:27.530 --> 05:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
after said time for them so again I I uh
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna thank you for the question
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not going to dodge
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
your question but I'm probably not going
 
05:03:33.890 --> 05:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
to answer it either I mean again I have
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
no direct knowledge of Mr Conway's
 
05:03:38.208 --> 05:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
character in either in his
 
05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
accomplishments or anything that may
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
deter from his accomplishments I don't
 
05:03:43.970 --> 05:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
have any reason with that you know the
 
05:03:45.890 --> 05:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
sole reason for my testimony today is
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
that generally my ex my experience has
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
been we wait until the person is passed
 
05:03:52.730 --> 05:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
and we make these memorializations
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
posthumously generally
 
05:03:57.410 --> 05:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know of very many times in the
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
military where we name something after
 
05:04:00.890 --> 05:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
somebody who's alive
 
05:04:03.170 --> 05:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh it would have to be a pretty special
 
05:04:03.180 --> 05:04:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh it would have to be a pretty special
thing

05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
even Medal of Honor recipients they kind
 
05:04:09.050 --> 05:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh further questions did I see here
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:17.090 --> 05:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the opportunity may I
 
05:04:19.250 --> 05:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
ask you if um
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that we has to wait
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
until the person pass away until to mem
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
to give something to memorize the person
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't I don't think I was saying
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
my beliefs just my experiences right so
 
05:04:38.810 --> 05:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
my my beliefs are that uh that we my
 
05:04:40.730 --> 05:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
beliefs are my beliefs right so and I
 
05:04:42.410 --> 05:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I believe that it's appropriate to
 
05:04:44.090 --> 05:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
wait till it's till they've passed away
 
05:04:45.948 --> 05:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
to memorialize them generally the
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
memorialization is in remembrance of
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
that person and a tribute to them for
 
05:04:53.810 --> 05:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
their families most of the time are
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
there instances where people have been
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
memorialized before their death I'm sure
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
there are uh I I just don't think it's
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I've said I guess that's
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
again I came here expressing my opinion
 
05:05:08.930 --> 05:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
and and and my experiences so that's my
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
my belief
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's bad that we do it
 
05:05:13.850 --> 05:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
before they die but I just don't think
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's normal and I would I think it's
 
05:05:19.610 --> 05:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:24.190 --> 05:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.990 --> 05:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:05:27.000 --> 05:05:27.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
sir

05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:05:33.050 --> 05:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
the final card I have here is for
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
um Margaret Libre
 
05:05:38.810 --> 05:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
who also poses a bill and um indicated
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
that she would submit a written
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
testimony as well
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is Ms lebreck thank you for being
 
05:05:45.600 --> 05:05:55.310 align:start position:0%
this is Ms lebreck thank you for being
here

05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.530 --> 05:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
employee of Mr Conway's so again I have
 
05:06:12.288 --> 05:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
a memorandum from me
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
um in my prior conversations with chair
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
baldosaro you know he said that the uh
 
05:06:20.930 --> 05:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
the one problem that he heard about was
 
05:06:23.330 --> 05:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
only one employee and unfortunately I'm
 
05:06:25.128 --> 05:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
here to tell you a lot of employees
 
05:06:27.170 --> 05:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
don't come forward when they have issues
 
05:06:29.090 --> 05:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
with bullying and we all know that and
 
05:06:31.250 --> 05:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
especially somebody who is in high
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
standing right they are the department
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
head they are the person that talks to
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
Concord and so many long-term state
 
05:06:40.250 --> 05:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
employees don't come forward they put
 
05:06:41.810 --> 05:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
down their head they do their job every
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
day and they go forward and hope to
 
05:06:48.650 --> 05:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
retire and not be uh targeted
 
05:06:51.770 --> 05:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
so again I have written here an instance
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
that refers to what Mr Lloyd was
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
speaking of in the employee who wasn't
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
terminated and then actually won the
 
05:07:01.850 --> 05:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
suit and was resigned
 
05:07:01.860 --> 05:07:03.110 align:start position:0%
suit and was resigned
um

05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then later wrote in in your packet
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
and expose that was put on the internet
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
so it is public knowledge of a horrible
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
boss and and if you go to that page two
 
05:07:18.770 --> 05:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
two years into her job as the public
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
affairs director of the New Hampshire
 
05:07:23.090 --> 05:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home you know Lisa Marie began
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
to feel that her boss had it out for her
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then she explains what happened
 
05:07:26.400 --> 05:07:27.350 align:start position:0%
and then she explains what happened
there

05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:07:29.930 --> 05:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
and again with my conversations with um
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
chair bald sorrow
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know he said you know there was only
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
one person and so I read this again and
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
I said to myself
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know shame on me because I was a
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire veterans
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
home and there were times when I was
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
directed to remove people from a
 
05:07:48.650 --> 05:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
leadership role or a staff meeting and
 
05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
and to no longer invite them to that
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
staff meeting and
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
again he was my boss so I did as I was
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
told but maybe in hindsight I I should
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
have looked further into it so um I
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
guess I I feel that I own some of that
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
as well that there were other employees
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
who were Uninvited to staff meetings and
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
therefore didn't know of the going-ons
 
05:08:12.830 --> 05:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
at a higher level than
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and maybe they should have or I
 
05:08:16.730 --> 05:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
believe that they were at that meeting
 
05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
for a reason and should have continued
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
I go on to talk about
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
um when Mr Conway let us know that he
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
was retiring and he brought it up to
 
05:08:30.288 --> 05:08:30.298 align:start position:0%
myself and so I pursued and and got my
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator's license I
 
05:08:34.490 --> 05:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
went through the process as all state
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
employees right
 
05:08:37.850 --> 05:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
um we are compensated with salary and
 
05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
benefits and good retirement so I want
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
um my application went through human
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
resources and I was approved to have an
 
05:08:48.780 --> 05:08:49.970 align:start position:0%
resources and I was approved to have an
interview

05:08:49.970 --> 05:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
interview
 
05:08:51.770 --> 05:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
um the day before I was to have that
 
05:08:54.288 --> 05:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
interview he approached me and told me
 
05:08:55.930 --> 05:08:55.940 align:start position:0%
that he was going to pull my application
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
and he was going to tell the
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
interviewees that I had pulled my
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
application and so I will tell you I
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
told him quite vehemently that I didn't
 
05:09:07.010 --> 05:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
agree with that I was upset but again
 
05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm a long-term state employee who
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to lose my job
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I went to my office and did my job
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
and when approached as you can see by
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
both General protzman and Director of
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services Mary Morin that they
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
were sad that I had pulled my
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
application so that I knew that indeed
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Conway had not told the truth to
 
05:09:31.390 --> 05:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
those interviewees and that bothered me
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
but as things would turn out
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
the person that he had selected to be
 
05:09:39.410 --> 05:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
the next commandant backed out at the
 
05:09:42.288 --> 05:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
11th hour and so he told me I was his
 
05:09:43.610 --> 05:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
plan B
 
05:09:45.770 --> 05:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine that didn't go
 
05:09:47.810 --> 05:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
over very well but a good I'm a good
 
05:09:50.330 --> 05:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
state employee and I love my veterans
 
05:09:52.610 --> 05:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
and they'll do everything I can to
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
protect the veterans and the veterans
 
05:09:58.010 --> 05:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
home so I went forward and spoke to the
 
05:10:00.530 --> 05:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
board of managers at that time and they
 
05:10:00.540 --> 05:10:01.550 align:start position:0%
board of managers at that time and they
actually

05:10:01.550 --> 05:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:10:04.010 --> 05:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
um put me forward to the governor to be
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
the actual commandant and today nine
 
05:10:09.550 --> 05:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
years later I am deed am the commandant
 
05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
looking to retire with a state wonderful
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
State Pension again
 
05:10:15.718 --> 05:10:17.628 align:start position:0%
State Pension again
um

05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
um again I've got other information here
 
05:10:21.770 --> 05:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
just for your you know I ask you to
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
review it from a different point of view
 
05:10:27.530 --> 05:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that bullies don't bully
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
people in power
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
right bullies bully people that they
 
05:10:34.250 --> 05:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
think are not in power or have lost the
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
ability to fight back
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
that's how I feel in regards and
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I worked for Mr Conway for
 
05:10:43.970 --> 05:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
eight years seven years excuse me and it
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
bothered me that he did that to me but
 
05:10:49.610 --> 05:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
again why rock the boat when you could
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
lose your job and you could lose the
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
wages that you uh take care of your
 
05:10:55.490 --> 05:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
family with so
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:10:59.690 --> 05:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
you for offering to take questions are
 
05:11:03.410 --> 05:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
05:11:06.110 --> 05:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Massimo
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss uh representative often
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my questions
 
05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
were there any other people who came to
 
05:11:16.920 --> 05:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
were there any other people who came to
you

05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
during your tenure under Mr Conway that
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
had experienced similar problems
 
05:11:26.040 --> 05:11:27.530 align:start position:0%
had experienced similar problems
again

05:11:27.530 --> 05:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:11:29.810 --> 05:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
um there were I two reports that
 
05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
directly reported to me who were removed
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
from higher level staff meetings and
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
uninvited to attend
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
um but I must tell you they were
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
long-term employees so they just put
 
05:11:41.208 --> 05:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
their heads down and did their job right
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
and because they knew that I was between
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
I was now between them and him and they
 
05:11:47.690 --> 05:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
felt that I would protect them and they
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
would continue on with their job and
 
05:11:51.770 --> 05:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
both of them have since retired and I
 
05:11:53.330 --> 05:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't mention their name because I don't
 
05:11:55.730 --> 05:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
feel it's my I shouldn't put their names
 
05:11:57.708 --> 05:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
out there and if I identify their
 
05:11:59.330 --> 05:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
position which is a leadership position
 
05:12:00.730 --> 05:12:00.740 align:start position:0%
they should have been on that leadership
 
05:12:04.850 --> 05:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
but again shame on me for not
 
05:12:07.610 --> 05:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
fighting back at that time
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
um were there problems similar to yours
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:12:23.448 --> 05:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
it's more so rather than a a question
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
for you I just want to thank you for
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%

05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
as well sorry that that happened to you
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
and your colleagues but your courage
 
05:12:49.490 --> 05:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
inspires others to speak out and so I
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
admire you and thank you so much for
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
coming and sharing today it makes a
 
05:12:55.368 --> 05:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
difference again I leave these documents
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
with you so you can review them and take
 
05:12:58.448 --> 05:12:58.458 align:start position:0%
them into consideration
 
05:13:00.650 --> 05:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
again the New Hampshire Veterans Home
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
does everything we can to not only care
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
for our resident veterans but our staff
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
and my last statement is with dignity
 
05:13:10.610 --> 05:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
honor and respect and I do not believe
 
05:13:12.830 --> 05:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
that Mr Conway dealt that way with
 
05:13:12.840 --> 05:13:15.708 align:start position:0%
that Mr Conway dealt that way with
everybody

05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.208 --> 05:13:23.218 align:start position:0%
saying I'm uh thank you so much for uh
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
you thank you see if there's anyone else
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
who is here who would want to speak to
 
05:13:34.628 --> 05:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
in saying none I will declare this
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
session the sharing on this bill to be
 
05:13:41.400 --> 05:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
session the sharing on this bill to be
over

05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:04.160 --> 05:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
245

05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
245
 
05:14:06.000 --> 05:14:07.550 align:start position:0%
245
245.

05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
245.
 
05:14:10.610 --> 05:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
all right it's um
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd like to ask a question to
 
05:14:12.840 --> 05:14:14.810 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd like to ask a question to
Margaret

05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
Margaret
 
05:14:14.820 --> 05:14:16.430 align:start position:0%
Margaret
Margaret

05:14:16.430 --> 05:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
Margaret
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
Madame commandant
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff that you brought up is
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
all the information that I provided here
 
05:14:36.530 --> 05:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
had gone before the board of managers an
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
RSA right to know request was made by Mr
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
Conway that made it public documents
 
05:14:46.368 --> 05:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just wondering why um
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
15 years on this board never ever once
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
everyone every time I've been over there
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
people no they had opportunities to come
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
up and talk to us they knew I was the
 
05:14:58.490 --> 05:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
chairman or vice chair or another nobody
 
05:15:00.410 --> 05:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
ever and I knew quite a bit at the time
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
they worked over there because I was
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
there more with Barry under his watch
 
05:15:06.890 --> 05:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
than your watch and uh I'm just
 
05:15:08.448 --> 05:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
wondering why nobody ever came forward
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's uh it's a shame that
 
05:15:14.930 --> 05:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
now all of a sudden because he's gone
 
05:15:17.208 --> 05:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
that this stuff comes up and he denies
 
05:15:19.250 --> 05:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
it a hundred percent on on the bullying
 
05:15:21.770 --> 05:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
and I know Mr chairman
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
who's speaking it's my understanding
 
05:15:25.610 --> 05:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
that if you testified you cannot ask
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
Witnesses questions I can't hear it's my
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the house rules that if
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
you testified in support of a bill you
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
cannot ask questions of a witness
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
it is huh why don't you check the
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
Chairman's handbook
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
rather than a representative because you
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
have to come to me and then I'm the one
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
who you know can ask a question to
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
somebody that this is off the Record the
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
right the committee it's already closed
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out something
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
here because this is on YouTube and I
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that this stuff
 
05:15:57.050 --> 05:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
is in the record because if this comes
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
forward lawyers and other stuff on
 
05:16:00.890 --> 05:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
personal stuff that's been brought up
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
here that you prepared and you have
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
documentation absolutely sir okay this
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
has all been made public by Mr Conway
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing an RSA 91a and the New Hampshire
 
05:16:11.930 --> 05:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home opened up their
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
documentation for the board of managers
 
05:16:16.128 --> 05:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
meetings and so it has been posted on
 
05:16:19.550 --> 05:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
our website since the meeting occurred
 
05:16:21.650 --> 05:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
and the Horrible Bosses has been out on
 
05:16:24.050 --> 05:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
the internet and it can be Googled since
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
2000 and
 
05:16:28.730 --> 05:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
is it a one person due to a uh and I'm
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to get more on this here
 
05:16:31.430 --> 05:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
before we expect something like that
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
because everyone I mean it's a shame
 
05:16:35.708 --> 05:16:35.718 align:start position:0%
only the managers that are there today
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
and yourself but everyone else that I
 
05:16:40.490 --> 05:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
know and talk to speak very highly of
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
the guy and I mean it's like the general
 
05:16:44.750 --> 05:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
I mean how many times the general leaves
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
and then everyone found fault with the
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
general you know after the general
 
05:16:51.650 --> 05:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
already moved on although but the CEO so
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is this what's going
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
on with uh you know Barry Conway
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
so again you can read my memo exactly my

okay this bill was recommended by the
 
05:49:36.590 --> 05:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense here
 
05:49:38.270 --> 05:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and in the beginning I didn't have a
 
05:49:40.970 --> 05:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
clue about it until uh the gentleman who
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be here today can't make
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
it which is represent I mean Christopher
 
05:49:48.368 --> 05:49:48.378 align:start position:0%
Arnold he's the Northeast region liaison
 
05:49:51.530 --> 05:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Department of Defense
 
05:49:53.930 --> 05:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
I am through over the years of sponsored
 
05:49:55.788 --> 05:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
legislation that the Department of
 
05:49:58.250 --> 05:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
Defense comes up with a list of like the
 
05:50:01.010 --> 05:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
10 most important pieces of legislation
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
that they try to set up and be put in to
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
help veterans that move into different
 
05:50:07.970 --> 05:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
states throughout the country so this is
 
05:50:10.368 --> 05:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
basically one of those bills
 
05:50:12.770 --> 05:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
um it's an act established in concurrent
 
05:50:15.048 --> 05:50:15.058 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in juvenile matters with
 
05:50:16.670 --> 05:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Defense for
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
coordination with the military family
 
05:50:20.330 --> 05:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
advocacy program
 
05:50:22.490 --> 05:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
we have in place already a school
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
compact uh we have other stuff in place
 
05:50:27.770 --> 05:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
there for you know which we do in the
 
05:50:29.810 --> 05:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
school systems to help when when
 
05:50:31.730 --> 05:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
veterans move into the area
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
this I think is an another step in the
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
right area uh on helping and dealing
 
05:50:39.048 --> 05:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
with troubles I believe uh Utes and all
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
that and then dealing with uh
 
05:50:43.250 --> 05:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
information systems working hand in hand
 
05:50:46.730 --> 05:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
with the military family advocacy groups
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
on military bases and I'm going to have
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some people behind
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
me uh there's also an amendment being
 
05:50:56.288 --> 05:50:56.298 align:start position:0%
drafted as we speak
 
05:50:59.448 --> 05:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
for the dcyf and he'll come up and
 
05:51:01.368 --> 05:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
explain that there on a couple of
 
05:51:02.930 --> 05:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
Corrections that we're going to make on
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill here uh it's basically it's a
 
05:51:07.788 --> 05:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
win-win for the state I I wish uh
 
05:51:09.650 --> 05:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
Christopher was here to explain it more
 
05:51:10.990 --> 05:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
05:51:13.610 --> 05:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping you all got a copy of his
 
05:51:15.530 --> 05:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State
 
05:51:17.930 --> 05:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
did y'all get a copy of the letter and
 
05:51:20.750 --> 05:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
it goes into detail and on helping with
 
05:51:22.610 --> 05:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
the veterans uh
 
05:51:24.650 --> 05:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know and their children in the
 
05:51:27.230 --> 05:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
system yeah you know and we're moving
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
basically barriers uh you know
 
05:51:32.330 --> 05:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
um retro session in concurrent
 
05:51:34.670 --> 05:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on who's involved when it
 
05:51:37.490 --> 05:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
comes to military you know children so
 
05:51:39.650 --> 05:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's probably better that I let some of
 
05:51:41.390 --> 05:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
the people behind me step up to the
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
plate and give a little bit more insight
 
05:51:45.410 --> 05:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
because this is pretty much a win-win
 
05:51:47.930 --> 05:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
for the veteran community and I oh
 
05:51:50.090 --> 05:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
highly hope that we supported 150
 
05:51:50.100 --> 05:51:51.048 align:start position:0%
highly hope that we supported 150
percent

05:51:51.048 --> 05:51:51.058 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:55.610 --> 05:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for that introduction
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like the representative is
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
waived questions in lieu of subsequent
 
05:52:03.890 --> 05:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
testimony by
 
05:52:07.610 --> 05:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
those who have signed up to testify and
 
05:52:10.850 --> 05:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
at the top of our list here I see uh is
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
Kevin Gandy who is signed in to support
 
05:52:21.948 --> 05:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:24.288 --> 05:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman once again for the
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is Kevin Grady uh 25-year
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
Air Force veteran 23-year resident of
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
the town of Hooksett here representing
 
05:52:32.570 --> 05:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
today the state veterans advisory
 
05:52:32.580 --> 05:52:33.830 align:start position:0%
today the state veterans advisory
committee

05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
um when we first looked at this bill I
 
05:52:39.530 --> 05:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
have to be honest with you I had to read
 
05:52:40.970 --> 05:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
it two or three times to try and figure
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
out what we were we're doing with it
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a lawyer and I don't
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
play one on TV but I will tell you that
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
that what we're trying to do in a lot of
 
05:52:52.670 --> 05:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
cases here we've already we've already
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
established a basis for a lot of that in
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
our state and our committee felt
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
strongly that the more the more that
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
that when that when a federal program
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
which is required to come down and deal
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
with Family Matters from the from the
 
05:53:10.010 --> 05:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
federal level down to the state level
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
when those folks come down and and they
 
05:53:14.208 --> 05:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
they sort of have a list of of things
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to accomplish you
 
05:53:18.410 --> 05:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
can bet that somewhere back in
 
05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
Washington DC there is a chart on a wall
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
and it's got like green lights and red
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
lights and Amber lights and all that in
 
05:53:30.048 --> 05:53:30.058 align:start position:0%
terms of how well all of this stuff is
 
05:53:32.208 --> 05:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
being received by the various states
 
05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
that are going down there and
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
our our people were kind of uh
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
certain that we're doing a lot of these
 
05:53:42.410 --> 05:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
things we have advocacy for a lot of
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
these things and all we need to do now
 
05:53:46.490 --> 05:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
is just kind of go down this road with
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation and then if
 
05:53:49.730 --> 05:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's some follow-on things that we
 
05:53:52.010 --> 05:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
need to tweak to get it done then all of
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
a sudden we're on the green on all of
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
these programs and it's our our thought
 
05:53:59.150 --> 05:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
that when you when the state and the
 
05:54:00.410 --> 05:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
federal government is involved in
 
05:54:02.570 --> 05:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
something together the more that those
 
05:54:06.048 --> 05:54:06.058 align:start position:0%
rules and and plans can be the same as
 
05:54:07.368 --> 05:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
you work your way all the way down to
 
05:54:09.230 --> 05:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
the local level probably the better off
 
05:54:11.930 --> 05:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
we all are there are folks behind me and
 
05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
of course Mr Arnold's letter explains
 
05:54:15.650 --> 05:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
kind of a lot of what they're trying to
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish better than I possibly could
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm going to let the other
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
experts testify to this but we do
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
support this legislation from the state
 
05:54:25.250 --> 05:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Grady do you are you
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
available for questions at this time if
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
somebody has some I may not be able to
 
05:54:36.110 --> 05:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like we have some more
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
expert testimony coming uh thank you Mr
 
05:54:42.410 --> 05:54:42.420 align:start position:0%

first time okay without my glasses on
 
05:54:45.360 --> 05:54:46.670 align:start position:0%
first time okay without my glasses on
right

05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:54:48.770 --> 05:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
all right next up

05:55:02.090 --> 05:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%

Warren Perry Deputy Edge and General New
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services I have Miss
 
05:55:12.890 --> 05:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
cook with me uh Amy Cook who is the
 
05:55:14.628 --> 05:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
administrator of the division of
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
community-based military programs the
 
05:55:18.410 --> 05:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
department supports this bill we work
 
05:55:19.970 --> 05:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
very closely with Mr Arnold and his
 
05:55:19.980 --> 05:55:21.048 align:start position:0%
very closely with Mr Arnold and his
office

05:55:21.048 --> 05:55:21.058 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:55:22.970 --> 05:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Defense they are
 
05:55:25.070 --> 05:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
the proponency for military families
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and Mr Arnold specifically
 
05:55:28.730 --> 05:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
deals with region one which is
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
essentially the Northeast
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
he has provided some very detailed
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony and what this bill
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
does essentially is
 
05:55:41.170 --> 05:55:41.180 align:start position:0%
codifies into statute the procedures
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
that are already that already exist and
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
the agreements that already exist
 
05:55:48.890 --> 05:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
between the federal government uh
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
particularly the federal government and
 
05:55:52.310 --> 05:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so we're
 
05:55:54.288 --> 05:55:54.298 align:start position:0%
already doing the things that the law is
 
05:55:56.510 --> 05:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking us to do and now we're gonna
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
we're gonna memorialize that in statute
 
05:56:01.368 --> 05:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
so again you know I'm not I'm not an
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
expert in in you know domestic abuse or
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
the things that the the law gets after
 
05:56:10.850 --> 05:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
addressing what we find is the more
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
cooperatively we work with the you know
 
05:56:16.850 --> 05:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
with Mr Arnold in his office the more
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
support we get from them as well so we
 
05:56:20.470 --> 05:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
not only do we take care of the families
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the circumstances that
 
05:56:26.090 --> 05:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
the the law addresses but we also
 
05:56:28.610 --> 05:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
continue to gain support and uh and a
 
05:56:30.048 --> 05:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
good partnership with uh with the
 
05:56:32.810 --> 05:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense so subject to any
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
of your questions that concludes my
 
05:56:34.020 --> 05:56:35.390 align:start position:0%
of your questions that concludes my
statement

05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
statement
 
05:56:38.390 --> 05:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question
 
05:56:41.400 --> 05:56:42.010 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question
um

05:56:42.010 --> 05:56:42.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:45.650 --> 05:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
so is they look at the the new language
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but basically it
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
is saying that the that the feds get
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
first dibs on uh dealing with a
 
05:56:59.690 --> 05:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
a alleged crime
 
05:57:02.810 --> 05:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
um before the state does is that kind of
 
05:57:05.330 --> 05:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
what's the language says if in fact the
 
05:57:07.070 --> 05:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
crime occurs on a federal reservation
 
05:57:09.890 --> 05:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
right so and that that's generally the
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
way it is so if we were at Fort Knox or
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
Fort Drum New York and the crime occurs
 
05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
on the federal installation you know the
 
05:57:20.030 --> 05:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
confines of that installation
 
05:57:22.610 --> 05:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction generally defaults to the
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
federal government because it happened
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
in those lands what this law does is
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
says the state can handle this and now
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
we can bring to bear the resources in
 
05:57:32.090 --> 05:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
both the federal system and the state
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
system to solve the problem and that's
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
really the the solution that's trying to
 
05:57:38.510 --> 05:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
be applied here and again there isn't
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
there is an agreement between uh between
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and the
 
05:57:43.250 --> 05:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
federal government that talks about
 
05:57:44.990 --> 05:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
these things and really what we want to
 
05:57:46.368 --> 05:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
do is just kind of codify that in
 
05:57:46.378 --> 05:57:47.330 align:start position:0%
do is just kind of codify that in
statute

05:57:47.330 --> 05:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
it says that uh
 
05:57:52.368 --> 05:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
the state shall assume jurisdiction only
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
if waived by the federal court or U.S
 
05:57:57.890 --> 05:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm just curious uh does that
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
happen do you know this is it did the
 
05:58:02.990 --> 05:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
feds ever waive power absolutely
 
05:58:05.690 --> 05:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely just just like any courts
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
they fight over who has to do it not who
 
05:58:09.890 --> 05:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
wants to do it okay
 
05:58:11.448 --> 05:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
all right so I think it's more I think
 
05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's more common than you would
 
05:58:14.930 --> 05:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
think I mean the federal court system
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have the resources
 
05:58:18.890 --> 05:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
to deal with domestic abuse I mean
 
05:58:20.750 --> 05:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with federal crimes and
 
05:58:22.868 --> 05:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
federal issues certainly
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the state is more suited more
 
05:58:29.448 --> 05:58:29.458 align:start position:0%
resource in let's be fair right
 
05:58:31.548 --> 05:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
everybody has limited resources in these
 
05:58:34.010 --> 05:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
times right and in all times so the
 
05:58:35.930 --> 05:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
courts are overburdened but the federal
 
05:58:37.490 --> 05:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
government doesn't have really a system
 
05:58:39.770 --> 05:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
to deal with domestic abuse in the same
 
05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
scope that the state does so you're
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
concern about the federal government
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
ceding their Authority in this
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
particular case I think they would say
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
they're more apt to seated because it's
 
05:58:51.288 --> 05:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
better suited for the state to handle
 
05:58:54.048 --> 05:58:54.058 align:start position:0%
these issues very if that makes any
 
05:58:56.690 --> 05:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
sense that's very interesting other
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
questions for uh yes representative yeah
 
05:59:02.510 --> 05:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me ask a question
 
05:59:03.830 --> 05:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:05.690 --> 05:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just trying to understand I'm
 
05:59:08.510 --> 05:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
a clinical psychologist in Keene and if
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
there can't psychoanalyze me
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative while I'm here a little
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
bit just a little bit
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so when there's an abuse accusation
 
05:59:19.910 --> 05:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
for example child abuse there's this 800
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
line that goes right to the state to the
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf yes and we call that and that
 
05:59:28.208 --> 05:59:28.218 align:start position:0%
starts this whole investigation process
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
would this bill the art first of all are
 
05:59:33.890 --> 05:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
there Federal investigators as well are
 
05:59:36.288 --> 05:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
there people who just do it for the feds
 
05:59:38.810 --> 05:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
I think I I think would be more precise
 
05:59:40.368 --> 05:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
to say there are people who work for the
 
05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
federal government who do that kind of
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
work and it's not like the FBI is out to
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
do it so I'd make a distinction between
 
05:59:48.770 --> 05:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
a federal investigator and somebody who
 
05:59:49.970 --> 05:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
is in the employment of the federal
 
05:59:52.010 --> 05:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
government to do that right so I would I
 
05:59:53.930 --> 05:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
make that distinction and I'm probably
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
splitting hairs a little bit okay so how
 
05:59:58.730 --> 05:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
does it roll so in those cases I mean
 
06:00:00.430 --> 06:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
military installations have
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services just like
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere else so at Fort Knox there's
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
a criminal investigation division they
 
06:00:08.270 --> 06:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
have people who who investigate and
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
prosecute crimes in a system just like
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
they would in any district court in New
 
06:00:14.868 --> 06:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they do that is there a
 
06:00:17.208 --> 06:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
federal number like the suicide hotline
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
that that deals with domestic abuse the
 
06:00:21.288 --> 06:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is I just don't
 
06:00:23.930 --> 06:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
know but if there's an allegation of
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or abuse the military
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
particularly and this is where we're
 
06:00:31.250 --> 06:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
dealing has systems to deal with and
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
Report those things and the question
 
06:00:36.350 --> 06:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
really just becomes of uh of where
 
06:00:38.448 --> 06:00:38.458 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction lies and it's probably a
 
06:00:40.730 --> 06:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
very similar system to sexual assault
 
06:00:43.310 --> 06:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
right so if a sexual assault occurs on a
 
06:00:45.048 --> 06:00:45.058 align:start position:0%
military installation and there's been a
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
lot of news about that frankly in the
 
06:00:48.170 --> 06:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
military and is the is the military
 
06:00:50.090 --> 06:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
appropriately investigating those things
 
06:00:53.150 --> 06:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
but uh you know there's a jurisdictional
 
06:00:55.850 --> 06:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
piece that goes and at some point the
 
06:00:58.010 --> 06:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
federal investigator whoever it is at
 
06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
that local installation may decide that
 
06:01:01.490 --> 06:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
this is a matter for the Civil courts
 
06:01:03.770 --> 06:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
just depending on what goes on really
 
06:01:05.868 --> 06:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
what's at issue here is the federal
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
confines of peas or new federal property
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's in New Hampshire that's
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
associated with the military and there's
 
06:01:15.708 --> 06:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
not a lot of it pees Air Force Base or
 
06:01:17.448 --> 06:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
peace Air National Guard base is really
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
the place that it would most likely
 
06:01:21.530 --> 06:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
happen but there are no really family
 
06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
members that work there or reside there
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
so the issue in New Hampshire is
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh but and and that's another reason to
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
pass the law because it's it's more
 
06:01:34.850 --> 06:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the Civil Authorities to
 
06:01:37.010 --> 06:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
manage it back to your question and I've
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
talked a long way I'm not aware of any
 
06:01:43.368 --> 06:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
single number that's called to to deal
 
06:01:46.490 --> 06:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
with a hotline for domestic abuse that's
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
a federal line I am I am aware that the
 
06:01:52.490 --> 06:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
military in New Hampshire the National
 
06:01:54.890 --> 06:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
Guard the reserves The Navy Reserves the
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
Army Reserves uh the full-time
 
06:02:00.170 --> 06:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
recruiters have systems in their chains
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
of command for reporting and
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
investigating issues of domestic abuse
 
06:02:09.770 --> 06:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
or violence right so under this bill I'm
 
06:02:12.110 --> 06:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand if there is a
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
call to the state 800 number of say
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
child abuse at a federal
 
06:02:21.770 --> 06:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
facility right yes like peas or
 
06:02:21.780 --> 06:02:22.810 align:start position:0%
facility right yes like peas or
something

06:02:22.810 --> 06:02:22.820 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
would that then trigger the D the state
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
dcyf to alert the yes the feds and then
 
06:02:34.730 --> 06:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
and and then the fed the military then
 
06:02:36.890 --> 06:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
would lead would take the lead in
 
06:02:39.288 --> 06:02:39.298 align:start position:0%
deciding how that investigation would
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
proceed would it be done by military
 
06:02:44.750 --> 06:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
investigators or dcyf investigators I
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
think no I think that the first part of
 
06:02:50.048 --> 06:02:50.058 align:start position:0%
your statement is absolutely correct
 
06:02:53.090 --> 06:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
dcyf or the state whoever receives the
 
06:02:54.890 --> 06:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
call from the state would have an
 
06:02:58.010 --> 06:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
obligation to notify the federal the the
 
06:03:00.048 --> 06:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Federal investigative
 
06:03:02.570 --> 06:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
agency at that point a decision would be
 
06:03:05.090 --> 06:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
made where it's most appropriate to
 
06:03:08.448 --> 06:03:08.458 align:start position:0%
handle the investigative process okay I
 
06:03:11.810 --> 06:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
and as I answered to the chair I believe
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the federal government in this
 
06:03:16.850 --> 06:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
particular instance would believe that
 
06:03:18.170 --> 06:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's more appropriate to do that
 
06:03:20.208 --> 06:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
investigation it's in the state system
 
06:03:21.770 --> 06:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
not the federal system well I would hope
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
so I guess my concern just trying to
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
understand how the law would work is
 
06:03:29.570 --> 06:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
that somehow that the uh maybe the fed
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the military investigators would would
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
take it on when in fact they didn't have
 
06:03:39.948 --> 06:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
the capacity that the dcyf had but I
 
06:03:44.448 --> 06:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
think that's a possibility but more than
 
06:03:47.330 --> 06:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
really really really really remote now
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
it might be it might be a different
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
issue at Fort Hood Texas where there are
 
06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
40 000 soldiers on a military
 
06:03:55.368 --> 06:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
installation but in New Hampshire
 
06:03:57.890 --> 06:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
total actively serving population is
 
06:03:59.930 --> 06:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
less than six thousand and that's from
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
all four five components including space
 
06:04:05.330 --> 06:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
force and the Coast Guard and the guard
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
and Reserve so I it's and it's and
 
06:04:10.368 --> 06:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
there's no structure there's no military
 
06:04:13.128 --> 06:04:13.138 align:start position:0%
structure in New Hampshire for that to
 
06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate response
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the actual office that deals
 
06:04:21.470 --> 06:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
with this for New Hampshire is in is in
 
06:04:21.480 --> 06:04:22.788 align:start position:0%
with this for New Hampshire is in is in
Massachusetts

06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
06:04:25.368 --> 06:04:25.378 align:start position:0%
so that that that military Hub is in
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and my understanding is I
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it I've asked Mr Arnold to
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
provide it that there is a memorandum of
 
06:04:33.948 --> 06:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
understanding between that office and
 
06:04:35.590 --> 06:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
06:04:38.090 --> 06:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
another another follow-up
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh no I I think I'm set yeah so and I I
 
06:04:44.570 --> 06:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
guess I would close my statement by
 
06:04:46.010 --> 06:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
saying and they are and they are
 
06:04:47.330 --> 06:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
coordinating with each other already
 
06:04:47.340 --> 06:04:48.948 align:start position:0%
coordinating with each other already
okay

06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:51.288 --> 06:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:04:54.590 --> 06:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
um would this mean like like local
 
06:05:00.530 --> 06:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
police would uh handle this like
 
06:05:04.368 --> 06:05:04.378 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Police or State Police or
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
like you said this would be handled by
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
local authorities which local Authority
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
so I think I think the initial response
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
may be made by local police departments
 
06:05:17.690 --> 06:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
but dcyf would have the responsibility
 
06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
to conduct whatever investigation that
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
goes on that's my understanding again I
 
06:05:23.810 --> 06:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to speak for the Department
 
06:05:25.850 --> 06:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services or dcyf so
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
I have to be careful about my response
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
but I think the initial response may be
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
made by local law enforcement but it
 
06:05:33.048 --> 06:05:33.058 align:start position:0%
would be referred to the appropriate
 
06:05:35.570 --> 06:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
investigative agency after that
 
06:05:37.610 --> 06:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
other follow-ups
 
06:05:40.128 --> 06:05:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're good representative one
 
06:05:43.368 --> 06:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
uh other questions
 
06:05:47.090 --> 06:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh speaking of uh dcyf I
 
06:05:49.730 --> 06:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
have a pink card here from Joe ripson uh
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
if I said that correctly the director
 
06:05:57.770 --> 06:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:05.570 --> 06:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody Joe ripsom
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
director dcyf thank you for having me
 
06:06:11.330 --> 06:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
today the department is in support of
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
this bill with a couple minor amendments
 
06:06:14.208 --> 06:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
that I'll speak about in a minute before
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
that I'll speak to some of the
 
06:06:16.670 --> 06:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that was just happening
 
06:06:18.890 --> 06:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
before I came here to New Hampshire I
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
was in New Jersey for about 10 years
 
06:06:22.010 --> 06:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
I've been here for about four doing this
 
06:06:22.020 --> 06:06:23.030 align:start position:0%
I've been here for about four doing this
work

06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we had a we have a couple military
 
06:06:26.270 --> 06:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
bases in New Jersey where we had you
 
06:06:28.850 --> 06:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
know active military living on base in
 
06:06:30.350 --> 06:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
those instances
 
06:06:32.570 --> 06:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
um what typically would happen was they
 
06:06:34.490 --> 06:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
would call us to our child protection
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
system to do the investigation if there
 
06:06:37.250 --> 06:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
was an allegation of abuse or neglect
 
06:06:38.570 --> 06:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't have a lot of
 
06:06:40.128 --> 06:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
folks living on on base I don't know if
 
06:06:41.868 --> 06:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
we have any but I've never experienced
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire having a call to invest
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
to investigate somebody living on base
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
if you have active military living off
 
06:06:49.490 --> 06:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
of Base the state is always the person
 
06:06:51.410 --> 06:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
to do the investigation and the thing
 
06:06:52.730 --> 06:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
that we like about this piece of
 
06:06:55.368 --> 06:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it opens up the
 
06:06:56.750 --> 06:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
ability for us to legally share
 
06:06:58.430 --> 06:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
information with the family advocacy
 
06:07:00.830 --> 06:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
program when we get a call about a
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
military family who's actively and who's
 
06:07:04.128 --> 06:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
active in the military and it's helpful
 
06:07:06.830 --> 06:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
because the family advocacy program has
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources to help support
 
06:07:10.368 --> 06:07:10.378 align:start position:0%
families identify what the issues are
 
06:07:12.650 --> 06:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
try to help solve the problems and if
 
06:07:13.730 --> 06:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's really a big concern about
 
06:07:15.288 --> 06:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
what's happening in that house be able
 
06:07:17.570 --> 06:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
to use you know the military
 
06:07:20.030 --> 06:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
um you know authority to help take care
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
of some of the some of the issues that
 
06:07:24.170 --> 06:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
might be happening within that home so
 
06:07:25.730 --> 06:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
we're in support of the bill because we
 
06:07:27.110 --> 06:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be helpful for us to
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
be able to make sure that whenever we
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
get a call involving a family that's
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
active military the family advocacy
 
06:07:33.530 --> 06:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
program will be able to also help out in
 
06:07:35.868 --> 06:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
addition to what the state brings but we
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
would maintain the investigatory
 
06:07:38.930 --> 06:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the investigatory
 
06:07:40.010 --> 06:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
Authority it would really be about
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
accessing the military services to help
 
06:07:44.090 --> 06:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
the family in that instance
 
06:07:45.830 --> 06:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
the couple minor amendments that we're
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
asking for are just to clarify the point
 
06:07:49.128 --> 06:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
at which we'd be able to share
 
06:07:51.890 --> 06:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
information with the military as this is
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
drafted I think it was intended to do to
 
06:07:56.330 --> 06:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
make to change the way that I'm
 
06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
recommending that it be changed as it
 
06:08:00.110 --> 06:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
was drafted though we would not be
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to contact the military until
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
after we completed an investigation and
 
06:08:05.868 --> 06:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
until after we made a finding of abuse
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
or neglect we want to tweak the language
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
a little bit just to make clear that we
 
06:08:10.610 --> 06:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
can make that contact with the military
 
06:08:12.890 --> 06:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
at the start of an investigation so that
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
they can come in and help out
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
immediately and not wait for a full
 
06:08:17.690 --> 06:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
process to to go through and go to court
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
and everything else before we get to
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
tell them about it so the two minor
 
06:08:22.368 --> 06:08:22.378 align:start position:0%
changes are just changing the
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
codification one section up sooner
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
because it's currently codified in a
 
06:08:27.170 --> 06:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
part of the statute that only talks
 
06:08:29.570 --> 06:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
about once a once an investigation is
 
06:08:31.850 --> 06:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
complete the other change we would like
 
06:08:35.570 --> 06:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
to make is just in Section 3 a currently
 
06:08:37.490 --> 06:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
reads if a report is accepted as a
 
06:08:39.288 --> 06:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
founded allegation which to us means
 
06:08:41.208 --> 06:08:41.218 align:start position:0%
we've made a we've investigated and made
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
a finding change that to say if a report
 
06:08:46.128 --> 06:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
is screened in for investigation which
 
06:08:47.750 --> 06:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
means that we could have contact at the
 
06:08:49.368 --> 06:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
moment we started investigation still
 
06:08:50.690 --> 06:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
waiting instead of waiting for it to
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
finish and with that I'm happy to take
 
06:08:55.610 --> 06:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.810 --> 06:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.288 --> 06:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the uh the bill that I
 
06:09:09.298 --> 06:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the uh the bill that I
have

06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:09:10.080 --> 06:09:11.750 align:start position:0%
have
and

06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
um is
 
06:09:19.010 --> 06:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr original chair is there an
 
06:09:19.020 --> 06:09:19.970 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr original chair is there an
amendment

06:09:19.970 --> 06:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:09:19.980 --> 06:09:22.730 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

06:09:22.730 --> 06:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
okay so all right that's why
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Miss Mr former Mr
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
original chair
 
06:09:34.010 --> 06:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh that is my question okay so this is
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh that was a good question as to this
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
is what I'm looking at is not the final
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
recommended amended version correct okay
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
 
06:09:46.190 --> 06:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
locowitz thank you Mr chair
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
um Mr ripson uh just thank you one other
 
06:09:51.470 --> 06:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
question so it's the purpose of of
 
06:09:53.628 --> 06:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
making that change so that you could
 
06:09:56.208 --> 06:09:56.218 align:start position:0%
contact the military at an earlier point
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the is the purpose to help gather and
 
06:10:02.330 --> 06:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
do assessment or for intervention is it
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
to get Services going in place or is it
 
06:10:07.730 --> 06:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
to collect more information it's really
 
06:10:10.010 --> 06:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
it the most typical usage and we did
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
this in New Jersey as well is to help
 
06:10:14.208 --> 06:10:14.218 align:start position:0%
get extra services in place for the
 
06:10:15.410 --> 06:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
family that's typically what the family
 
06:10:17.930 --> 06:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
advocacy program is doing I've not seen
 
06:10:19.730 --> 06:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
an incident of this in in New Hampshire
 
06:10:21.470 --> 06:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
I had seen one in New Jersey where there
 
06:10:22.970 --> 06:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
was some really extreme physical abuse
 
06:10:24.890 --> 06:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
happening in a military household and
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
the military was able to intervene
 
06:10:28.730 --> 06:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
through their you know legal processes
 
06:10:30.530 --> 06:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
to to address those issues as well as
 
06:10:32.690 --> 06:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state I've not seen that here
 
06:10:32.700 --> 06:10:36.590 align:start position:0%
the state I've not seen that here
fortunately

06:10:36.590 --> 06:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:39.548 --> 06:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:10:42.410 --> 06:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would thank you very much
 
06:10:45.708 --> 06:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:49.490 --> 06:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I seen a more pink cards and I see
 
06:10:52.910 --> 06:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
no one else in the room so given that we
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
will declare this hearing uh at this
 
06:11:32.570 --> 06:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:46.010 --> 06:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may um the next hearing's at 3
 
06:11:49.128 --> 06:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
45 I some of these bills uh you know I
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
the way I schedule them here looking at
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that like they were
 
06:11:54.530 --> 06:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the dod guy was going to be here
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
today and it would be a little bit
 
06:11:57.830 --> 06:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
longer so I figured he's out and that
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
way enough time to
 
06:12:01.910 --> 06:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
um maybe some I can slide in and exec
 
06:12:04.128 --> 06:12:04.138 align:start position:0%
bill so it's less on the end of the week
 
06:12:06.770 --> 06:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
next week so if once we get the
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'll talk with your
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
ranking member if you're all on board
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill then you know we'll put
 
06:12:15.170 --> 06:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
this to bed also you know I mean and
 
06:12:18.288 --> 06:12:18.298 align:start position:0%
then uh you know so that will keep an
 
06:12:19.610 --> 06:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
eye on the amendment when it comes
 
06:12:22.610 --> 06:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
forward okay so uh
 
06:12:26.030 --> 06:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
like I said the next bill is at uh two
 
06:12:28.128 --> 06:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
four three forty five is there anything
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
no yeah no we'll have time we'll move it
 
06:12:39.360 --> 06:12:40.570 align:start position:0%
no yeah no we'll have time we'll move it
uh

06:12:40.570 --> 06:12:40.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:43.670 --> 06:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
yelling for people if it comes yeah
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%

something

06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:41:46.250 --> 06:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:48.288 --> 06:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
and the other question is um
 
06:41:50.270 --> 06:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to understand why you
 
06:42:15.170 --> 06:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:27.288 --> 06:42:27.298 align:start position:0%

06:43:15.590 --> 06:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
I understand that but I'm just
 
06:43:48.350 --> 06:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:48.360 --> 06:43:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:43:49.440 --> 06:44:44.570 align:start position:0%
oh
yeah

06:44:44.570 --> 06:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:46.010 --> 06:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's great he's a great state senator
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:14.030 --> 06:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:15.708 --> 06:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
okay everyone should have got that
 
06:45:15.718 --> 06:45:16.970 align:start position:0%
okay everyone should have got that
Amendment

06:45:16.970 --> 06:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:45:19.610 --> 06:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
um that came in so once we get done with
 
06:45:21.530 --> 06:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
this we'll probably go ahead and exec
 
06:45:21.540 --> 06:46:00.288 align:start position:0%
this we'll probably go ahead and exec
that

06:46:00.288 --> 06:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
very desirable when I when I started
 
06:46:02.878 --> 06:46:14.510 align:start position:0%
very desirable when I when I started
college

06:46:14.510 --> 06:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:25.968 --> 06:46:25.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:33.410 --> 06:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:35.930 --> 06:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're all set
 
06:46:37.610 --> 06:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
I want to open up the hearing on House
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 1441 and establishing a commission
 
06:46:42.590 --> 06:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
organized organized The Observer
 
06:46:46.310 --> 06:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
observations of the 250th anniversary of
 
06:46:48.650 --> 06:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of Independence and I
 
06:46:50.510 --> 06:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to welcome representative Timothy
 
06:46:57.708 --> 06:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:59.750 --> 06:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
he even gave us written testimony good
 
06:47:03.230 --> 06:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:03.240 --> 06:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

06:47:05.750 --> 06:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:47:08.270 --> 06:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's good to be here um
 
06:47:10.610 --> 06:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
certainly Aldo certainly as the chairman
 
06:47:11.750 --> 06:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
knows very well I'm representative
 
06:47:14.030 --> 06:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from the towns of uh
 
06:47:16.010 --> 06:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
from Stratford County six which is the
 
06:47:18.170 --> 06:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
towns of Durham and Madbury and that's
 
06:47:19.850 --> 06:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
actually where uh
 
06:47:21.468 --> 06:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
two of my three
 
06:47:24.350 --> 06:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors are are from two and one of
 
06:47:25.610 --> 06:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
whom was representative wall is on this
 
06:47:27.650 --> 06:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
06:47:30.590 --> 06:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
apparently uh maybe uh she's considering
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
a she may be drafting an amendment but
 
06:47:35.090 --> 06:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
that won't be ready uh ready for a while
 
06:47:38.208 --> 06:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
so historical issues behind this are are
 
06:47:40.490 --> 06:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
very complicated uh but its aim is
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
basically pretty simple to start
 
06:47:44.270 --> 06:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
planning for the Hampshire's observance
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the 250th anniversary of the
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence and
 
06:47:50.810 --> 06:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
probably noticed around if you read the
 
06:47:52.868 --> 06:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill you know OLS put this rather
 
06:47:55.968 --> 06:47:55.978 align:start position:0%
lengthy latinate word sester Centennial
 
06:47:57.530 --> 06:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
the bill which apparently basically
 
06:47:59.810 --> 06:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
means one plus one and a half hundred
 
06:47:59.820 --> 06:48:01.010 align:start position:0%
means one plus one and a half hundred
years

06:48:01.010 --> 06:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:48:03.350 --> 06:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the federal American 250 commission
 
06:48:04.910 --> 06:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
is using another long word I think
 
06:48:06.410 --> 06:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's even longer but I've encountered
 
06:48:08.208 --> 06:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
the letters semi quintessenial which
 
06:48:11.448 --> 06:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
means half of 500 years so um
 
06:48:14.030 --> 06:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents Senator Gene
 
06:48:16.430 --> 06:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
Shaheen is a member of the United States
 
06:48:16.440 --> 06:48:18.170 align:start position:0%
Shaheen is a member of the United States
sesame

06:48:18.170 --> 06:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
sesame
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
Quinn Centennial commission I think
 
06:48:21.650 --> 06:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
that's the last time well I guess maybe
 
06:48:23.270 --> 06:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'll say that word one more time if I
 
06:48:24.650 --> 06:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
read but I don't want to say that word
 
06:48:26.510 --> 06:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
anymore so I'm usually using the 250th
 
06:48:28.490 --> 06:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
anniversary and the
 
06:48:29.990 --> 06:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's uh there already has been a
 
06:48:32.628 --> 06:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
federal quote America 250 commission
 
06:48:34.430 --> 06:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
which Senator Shaheen sits on and that's
 
06:48:37.190 --> 06:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
been going since 2016. so it's coming up
 
06:48:38.750 --> 06:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
in four years in the state of New
 
06:48:38.760 --> 06:48:39.530 align:start position:0%
in four years in the state of New
Hampshire

06:48:39.530 --> 06:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:48:41.448 --> 06:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
my opinion needs to do something to Mark
 
06:48:44.990 --> 06:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
the 250th anniversary of July for 1776
 
06:48:46.968 --> 06:48:46.978 align:start position:0%
when the 13 colonies became the United
 
06:48:48.770 --> 06:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
States of America
 
06:48:50.868 --> 06:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
I'm like I don't know if my nation is
 
06:48:52.850 --> 06:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
more divided than it ever has been I
 
06:48:54.590 --> 06:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
mean we did have a it's probably not as
 
06:48:56.030 --> 06:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
bad as the Western the Civil War but
 
06:48:57.770 --> 06:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's the most divided it's been in my
 
06:48:59.030 --> 06:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
lifetime and
 
06:49:00.770 --> 06:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
last years have been tough due to the
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the political you know just
 
06:49:05.090 --> 06:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
the general political unrest and chaos
 
06:49:07.968 --> 06:49:07.978 align:start position:0%
but we are still one nation indivisible
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then uh to highlight of the
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
bicentennial in July 1976 for me
 
06:49:13.968 --> 06:49:13.978 align:start position:0%
personally was with my father Jim
 
06:49:16.548 --> 06:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
Harrigan who was also a State Rep just
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
like I am now gave a speech at the
 
06:49:20.570 --> 06:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
dedication of a pocket park on Main
 
06:49:22.310 --> 06:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
Street in Durham um
 
06:49:24.230 --> 06:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
Bicentennial Park actually is still
 
06:49:25.548 --> 06:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
there right at the corner of Mill Road
 
06:49:27.948 --> 06:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
and Main Street my father unfortunately
 
06:49:30.770 --> 06:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
died in 2011 so he will not be able to
 
06:49:32.570 --> 06:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
give another speech and I'm sure he was
 
06:49:34.010 --> 06:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
a much better speaker than I said he
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
would have given my speech would not
 
06:49:38.150 --> 06:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
have been as good as his and um
 
06:49:40.190 --> 06:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
but hopefully Durham and every other
 
06:49:41.510 --> 06:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
town in New Hampshire will do something
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
to Mark July 4th 2026 and as proposed
 
06:49:48.048 --> 06:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
I've got 15 members and there's a
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
like and we could possibly could
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
possibly pare it down I had like way
 
06:49:54.590 --> 06:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
more than that my original draft to the
 
06:49:56.930 --> 06:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
bill and uh Senator Waters he's one of
 
06:49:58.128 --> 06:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
our co-sponsors would kind of
 
06:49:59.690 --> 06:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
disappointed that was an excessively
 
06:50:02.930 --> 06:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
large group so I've got 15 not three
 
06:50:04.368 --> 06:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
members of the House three members of
 
06:50:06.230 --> 06:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the uh
 
06:50:08.690 --> 06:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
House of Senate delegations he's have at
 
06:50:11.628 --> 06:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
least one member of the uh of the uh
 
06:50:13.548 --> 06:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
of the minority party they'll be elected
 
06:50:15.770 --> 06:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
by the uh the speaker and the Senate
 
06:50:17.448 --> 06:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
President three members of the general
 
06:50:19.010 --> 06:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
public so those would be appointed by
 
06:50:20.090 --> 06:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
the governor and approved by the
 
06:50:21.708 --> 06:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
06:50:25.430 --> 06:50:25.440 align:start position:0%

06:50:46.128 --> 06:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
American Affairs or designees I just uh
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
I just thought I'd mention it because
 
06:50:49.250 --> 06:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
where our state was founded on land that
 
06:50:50.810 --> 06:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
was originally theirs and you know
 
06:50:52.670 --> 06:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
they've never actually seized it back to
 
06:50:55.548 --> 06:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
either us or the British but they're
 
06:50:57.170 --> 06:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
but um you know they're they're here and
 
06:50:59.090 --> 06:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're part of our community
 
06:51:00.708 --> 06:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
the commissions like this usually start
 
06:51:02.090 --> 06:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
to work a little bit sooner than four
 
06:51:03.110 --> 06:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
years out
 
06:51:05.270 --> 06:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the commission I guess I won't say that
 
06:51:06.708 --> 06:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
long word again but when the Senator
 
06:51:08.868 --> 06:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
Shaheen sits on was established back in
 
06:51:11.750 --> 06:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
2016 like I already said uh
 
06:51:13.910 --> 06:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
commission for the 2019 celebration of
 
06:51:15.890 --> 06:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
the state house why is Centennial was uh
 
06:51:19.030 --> 06:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
started up in 2014 the
 
06:51:21.948 --> 06:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
we also not in relatively recent years
 
06:51:23.510 --> 06:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
06:51:25.250 --> 06:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
we celebrate the bicentennial of the US
 
06:51:26.930 --> 06:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think that commission
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
started more than four years in advance
 
06:51:30.350 --> 06:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I think the
 
06:51:31.968 --> 06:51:31.978 align:start position:0%
Vice New Hampshire Bicentennial
 
06:51:34.548 --> 06:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
commission and uh
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of this and Crystal which um and
 
06:51:38.090 --> 06:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
that was back a lot of that goes back
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
way before the online uh legislative
 
06:51:42.890 --> 06:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
record is but I think it started
 
06:51:45.708 --> 06:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
way back around 1966 and the 60s and
 
06:51:48.230 --> 06:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually it kept going until like uh we
 
06:51:50.448 --> 06:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
extended it several times we the New
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house not me personally I
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
wasn't there even uh
 
06:51:56.810 --> 06:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
um they extended until 1991 so we're
 
06:51:58.250 --> 06:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
06:51:59.930 --> 06:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know so but we've got plenty of time
 
06:52:01.610 --> 06:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
to do something good and it probably
 
06:52:01.620 --> 06:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
to do something good and it probably
shouldn't

06:52:02.510 --> 06:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be limited just to uh the
 
06:52:05.750 --> 06:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence because
 
06:52:07.368 --> 06:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that came up
 
06:52:09.410 --> 06:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
happened before that a lot of things
 
06:52:10.968 --> 06:52:10.978 align:start position:0%
that happened years after that including
 
06:52:14.150 --> 06:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
a revolutionary war and you know the and
 
06:52:15.410 --> 06:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
then eventually we'll have to celebrate
 
06:52:16.968 --> 06:52:16.978 align:start position:0%
the 250th anniversary of the
 
06:52:16.978 --> 06:52:18.288 align:start position:0%
the 250th anniversary of the
Constitution

06:52:18.288 --> 06:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:52:20.390 --> 06:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh
 
06:52:22.968 --> 06:52:22.978 align:start position:0%
one thing certainly I hope uh and just
 
06:52:25.250 --> 06:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'll point out for your benefit uh Mr
 
06:52:26.990 --> 06:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair the and now I forgot the exact
 
06:52:29.770 --> 06:52:29.780 align:start position:0%
date but something like March 10th
 
06:52:31.910 --> 06:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
1775 was the founding of the Marine
 
06:52:33.708 --> 06:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
Corps so we'll definitely uh want to do
 
06:52:36.350 --> 06:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
a few celebrations for that on in 2025
 
06:52:38.270 --> 06:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
on March 10th or whatever the date may
 
06:52:40.730 --> 06:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
be so
 
06:52:43.610 --> 06:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you November 10th I knew you'd
 
06:52:45.410 --> 06:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
have that memorized let me open my mic
 
06:52:48.048 --> 06:52:48.058 align:start position:0%
again November 10 1775. thank you for
 
06:52:50.330 --> 06:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
coming thank you for correcting me and
 
06:52:52.128 --> 06:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
make sure the official records uh
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
supports that so all right
 
06:52:56.448 --> 06:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
so that is my uh
 
06:52:59.810 --> 06:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
so that is that is my proposal um and um
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's relatively simple and it's
 
06:53:04.128 --> 06:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
you know the something that is going to
 
06:53:06.890 --> 06:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
be done uh done anyway and
 
06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh representative I see

06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes I guess I should anyone

have questions uh representative
 
06:53:39.708 --> 06:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
deschase yes I knew he'd have some yeah
 
06:53:42.170 --> 06:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
yeah we we spoke before actually I I
 
06:53:44.030 --> 06:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
conjectured before you showed up I'm
 
06:53:45.170 --> 06:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
just gonna make a quick comment but
 
06:53:46.490 --> 06:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me Mr chair
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
06:53:50.448 --> 06:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
mentioned to uh the chairman that I
 
06:53:51.830 --> 06:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be willing to Guess that your
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
father had served on the bicentennial
 
06:53:56.510 --> 06:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold that was correct I'd
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
remember that from your testimony the
 
06:53:59.090 --> 06:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
other day earlier this week oh yeah
 
06:54:01.190 --> 06:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
probably right in my family a lot so
 
06:54:04.250 --> 06:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I was um so quick would you would
 
06:54:06.530 --> 06:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
you be amiable to a uh to an amendment
 
06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
by the committee to make the partisan
 
06:54:12.230 --> 06:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
makeup on this commission equal
 
06:54:12.240 --> 06:54:13.490 align:start position:0%
makeup on this commission equal
um

06:54:13.490 --> 06:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:15.590 --> 06:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
well that's great that's in your hands I
 
06:54:17.690 --> 06:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider that a deal breaker so
 
06:54:19.968 --> 06:54:19.978 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know that's this is your
 
06:54:21.590 --> 06:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill now so it's not mine so the
 
06:54:22.850 --> 06:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
committee is certainly free to amend it
 
06:54:25.368 --> 06:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
and that's uh that does also have the
 
06:54:27.288 --> 06:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
advantage of reducing
 
06:54:29.690 --> 06:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
reducing the size of the group a little
 
06:54:31.548 --> 06:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
bit so now it's down to 11 so make it
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
easier easier for them to you know
 
06:54:36.850 --> 06:54:36.860 align:start position:0%
to reach a consensus and so forth so
 
06:54:39.650 --> 06:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh
 
06:54:41.810 --> 06:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm wouldn't say I'm against that so
 
06:54:43.968 --> 06:54:43.978 align:start position:0%
when I wouldn't say I'm for it either
 
06:54:46.090 --> 06:54:46.100 align:start position:0%
but I yeah
 
06:54:48.650 --> 06:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
and we don't know which party will be
 
06:54:50.570 --> 06:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
the majority like when the same well I
 
06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:57.288 --> 06:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
on patches I guess we'll know like who's
 
06:54:58.788 --> 06:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
going to be in majority and like
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
whenever the governor gets around the
 
06:55:03.468 --> 06:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
signing it which so yeah that's that's
 
06:55:04.730 --> 06:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
up to you I certainly think you
 
06:55:05.990 --> 06:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
certainly should draw up an amendment to
 
06:55:08.570 --> 06:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
that uh to that to do that if you feel
 
06:55:10.788 --> 06:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea and it doesn't sound
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
terrible to me
 
06:55:15.530 --> 06:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
could I have a Fallout uh I was also
 
06:55:16.910 --> 06:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
just wondering and I'm I was talking to
 
06:55:19.070 --> 06:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
you in uh one of the co-sponsors um
 
06:55:20.750 --> 06:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
could you explain the reasoning behind
 
06:55:22.010 --> 06:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
having the uh the chair of the
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
University system the chair of the
 
06:55:25.730 --> 06:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
community college system uh you know the
 
06:55:26.990 --> 06:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the trustees or one of their
 
06:55:29.868 --> 06:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
designees on to this legislation I don't
 
06:55:31.968 --> 06:55:31.978 align:start position:0%
I was kind of confused regarding um
 
06:55:33.650 --> 06:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
because the commission could get their
 
06:55:35.690 --> 06:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
input either way and ask them to set up
 
06:55:37.190 --> 06:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
programming what's the reasoning for
 
06:55:39.230 --> 06:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
having them also be a voting member uh
 
06:55:40.788 --> 06:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
just they
 
06:55:43.070 --> 06:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
this is at least in part A educational
 
06:55:46.128 --> 06:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
effort so I figured they they both
 
06:55:49.548 --> 06:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
and then they may even incorporate you
 
06:55:51.170 --> 06:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
know integration will even affect what
 
06:55:52.610 --> 06:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
they teach in their history curriculum
 
06:55:54.530 --> 06:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
over the next several years so I I just
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
figured and I believe we did do
 
06:55:58.190 --> 06:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
something similar with some some of the
 
06:56:00.048 --> 06:56:00.058 align:start position:0%
previous commissions I think
 
06:56:00.058 --> 06:56:01.128 align:start position:0%
previous commissions I think
um

06:56:01.128 --> 06:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
I don't have a copy of here and I
 
06:56:04.430 --> 06:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at it in a few few weeks
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
but they I think they think they're on
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
the bike I think they're on the
 
06:56:08.510 --> 06:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
bicentennial the State House Commission
 
06:56:11.090 --> 06:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
and then the also the uh
 
06:56:13.250 --> 06:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and then there's also like that was a
 
06:56:15.890 --> 06:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
similar makeup to the uh constant the
 
06:56:17.810 --> 06:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
250 two ends of the anniversary of the
 
06:56:19.868 --> 06:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution commission back in the 19
 
06:56:22.430 --> 06:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
1990s so
 
06:56:22.440 --> 06:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
1990s so
yeah

06:56:23.390 --> 06:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:56:25.610 --> 06:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
certainly uh just one or two more
 
06:56:27.650 --> 06:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
follow-ups Mr chairman
 
06:56:29.330 --> 06:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so I was also just wondering about
 
06:56:31.250 --> 06:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
the uh the the New Hampshire Commission
 
06:56:32.810 --> 06:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
of Native American Affairs the chair of
 
06:56:34.788 --> 06:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
that or a designee
 
06:56:36.890 --> 06:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I I think it was kind of confusing
 
06:56:40.128 --> 06:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
reading the first section of the bill as
 
06:56:42.288 --> 06:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
to um so you want to also do the events
 
06:56:43.670 --> 06:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
leading up so you'd also want to be
 
06:56:45.530 --> 06:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
looking at Native American history too
 
06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
in regards to how it relates to the
 
06:56:49.368 --> 06:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence could you
 
06:56:51.410 --> 06:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
could you kind of explain how you would
 
06:56:53.628 --> 06:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
feel the commission would integrate that
 
06:56:56.208 --> 06:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
and how this uh how this chair of the
 
06:56:57.350 --> 06:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire commission Native American
 
06:57:00.170 --> 06:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
Affairs would actually fit into this
 
06:57:02.090 --> 06:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
whole equation well first of all I mean
 
06:57:05.390 --> 06:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
I guess our state was uh Abernathy land
 
06:57:06.948 --> 06:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
which they call it indicina that was
 
06:57:08.930 --> 06:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
back before the English and then us
 
06:57:08.940 --> 06:57:10.070 align:start position:0%
back before the English and then us
Americans

06:57:10.070 --> 06:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
Americans
 
06:57:12.230 --> 06:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh took over and
 
06:57:12.240 --> 06:57:13.070 align:start position:0%
uh took over and
um

06:57:13.070 --> 06:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:14.868 --> 06:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
so there's a long and conflicted history
 
06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
with the evanaki and other tribes but
 
06:57:19.250 --> 06:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
there's also a
 
06:57:21.890 --> 06:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
like but there's also been some
 
06:57:23.390 --> 06:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that's especially relevant
 
06:57:25.070 --> 06:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing probably is that the
 
06:57:27.048 --> 06:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution was facing large part
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
on a uh
 
06:57:32.930 --> 06:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution that the the Iroquois and
 
06:57:34.968 --> 06:57:34.978 align:start position:0%
other tribes uh
 
06:57:38.628 --> 06:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
made up in the 18th century uh so
 
06:57:40.010 --> 06:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
because um
 
06:57:41.750 --> 06:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
one thing about one thing about this we
 
06:57:44.750 --> 06:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
we kind of there's as much history
 
06:57:46.670 --> 06:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's been there's more than 200
 
06:57:48.590 --> 06:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's about two it's more than 250 years
 
06:57:50.930 --> 06:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
before that that Europeans began coming
 
06:57:53.208 --> 06:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
uh to the across the Atlantic Oceans
 
06:57:55.730 --> 06:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
actually the pre-colonial history of
 
06:57:57.230 --> 06:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire and the United States
 
06:57:59.208 --> 06:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
in general is actually longer than like
 
06:58:00.890 --> 06:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
the history of the United States as the
 
06:58:02.390 --> 06:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
United States but I just felt they
 
06:58:04.190 --> 06:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
deserved the place at the table
 
06:58:04.200 --> 06:58:05.390 align:start position:0%
deserved the place at the table
um

06:58:05.390 --> 06:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:07.610 --> 06:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
they actually I gotta tell frankly they
 
06:58:09.170 --> 06:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
don't really consider that a date to
 
06:58:10.968 --> 06:58:10.978 align:start position:0%
celebrate because things really actually
 
06:58:13.010 --> 06:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
got worse for them at least immediately
 
06:58:15.650 --> 06:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
after the uh After the Revolution
 
06:58:17.750 --> 06:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
because they um you know they
 
06:58:20.448 --> 06:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
they've they've reached sort of like a
 
06:58:21.890 --> 06:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
they've reserved a state of code's
 
06:58:23.510 --> 06:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
existence with the uh British
 
06:58:26.150 --> 06:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
authorities and now they had like us now
 
06:58:27.590 --> 06:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
they had the colonists were running the
 
06:58:28.968 --> 06:58:28.978 align:start position:0%
show for ourselves and we weren't
 
06:58:31.730 --> 06:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh we weren't necessarily
 
06:58:33.410 --> 06:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
any more enlightened than the British
 
06:58:34.730 --> 06:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
leaders have been when it came to
 
06:58:36.410 --> 06:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh you know the indigenous
 
06:58:38.570 --> 06:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
peoples so but I felt they deserved a
 
06:58:40.490 --> 06:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
place at the table um if
 
06:58:42.948 --> 06:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
them and it's up to the committee decide
 
06:58:44.270 --> 06:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
what the membership should be so you
 
06:58:46.310 --> 06:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
might want I mean see I do certainly
 
06:58:47.930 --> 06:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
understand the general impetus to start
 
06:58:50.810 --> 06:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
simplifying a little bit more because my
 
06:58:52.368 --> 06:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
first draft was like even longer than
 
06:58:54.410 --> 06:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
that and I was convinced to make it
 
06:58:57.530 --> 06:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
shorter so uh just one more question Mr
 
06:58:59.750 --> 06:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may go ahead yes
 
06:59:02.510 --> 06:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you um if the
 
06:59:05.150 --> 06:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors would um would find a
 
06:59:07.850 --> 06:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
permissible to add a like a veterans
 
06:59:10.190 --> 06:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group to the commission I think
 
06:59:12.230 --> 06:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
that as you mentioned you know obviously
 
06:59:14.208 --> 06:59:14.218 align:start position:0%
our military and you know the uh the
 
06:59:15.708 --> 06:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
early you know the early um
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
establishment of our military and
 
06:59:18.948 --> 06:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
helping defend the colonies and the
 
06:59:21.948 --> 06:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
militias played in an immense role in
 
06:59:23.750 --> 06:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
the uh in the independence of our
 
06:59:24.890 --> 06:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
country so I'm wondering if you would
 
06:59:26.030 --> 06:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good thing for
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
this well it's not a bad idea and
 
06:59:29.390 --> 06:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
probably the best candidate for that job
 
06:59:31.010 --> 06:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
is uh sitting right here in front of me
 
06:59:33.788 --> 06:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:36.770 --> 06:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
but I thank you for that uh I want to
 
06:59:38.390 --> 06:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
just run some by a few years ago this
 
06:59:40.968 --> 06:59:40.978 align:start position:0%
committee uh we looked at the Indian
 
06:59:42.770 --> 06:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
welfare which I thought was a great
 
06:59:42.780 --> 06:59:43.690 align:start position:0%
welfare which I thought was a great
thing

06:59:43.690 --> 06:59:43.700 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:59:45.830 --> 06:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people didn't know and I didn't
 
06:59:47.990 --> 06:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand windy and Welfare but after
 
06:59:49.910 --> 06:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
doing some research
 
06:59:52.490 --> 06:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
we had no tribes that settled in New
 
06:59:52.500 --> 06:59:53.330 align:start position:0%
we had no tribes that settled in New
Hampshire

06:59:53.330 --> 06:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:59:55.968 --> 06:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
and we had no uh they tried the
 
06:59:57.770 --> 06:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
abernakis and the other Indian groups
 
07:00:00.048 --> 07:00:00.058 align:start position:0%
traveled through New Hampshire that's
 
07:00:01.490 --> 07:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
why I'm glad you asked that question
 
07:00:04.190 --> 07:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
there on the Indians here because they
 
07:00:06.230 --> 07:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
traveled through New Hampshire but they
 
07:00:08.270 --> 07:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
settled in Maine in Massachusetts and
 
07:00:11.150 --> 07:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
New York and other Vermont or Canada but
 
07:00:13.250 --> 07:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire at least we
 
07:00:15.650 --> 07:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any data that supported
 
07:00:17.510 --> 07:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
that when we did the Indian welfare
 
07:00:20.690 --> 07:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
because we did pass to get the tribes
 
07:00:22.730 --> 07:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
together here in New Hampshire so I just
 
07:00:24.650 --> 07:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw that out there and for
 
07:00:26.570 --> 07:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
welfare it doesn't mean like something
 
07:00:28.670 --> 07:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
going on welfare means a program they
 
07:00:30.590 --> 07:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
have for the Indians there to help them
 
07:00:33.468 --> 07:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
financially education and other stuff if
 
07:00:35.330 --> 07:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
they had land and other things well I
 
07:00:37.250 --> 07:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
mean but I just wanted to put that out
 
07:00:39.350 --> 07:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
there okay I
 
07:00:41.390 --> 07:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
my view of the history is a little bit
 
07:00:43.610 --> 07:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
different but I'm not necessarily the
 
07:00:46.910 --> 07:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
definitive expert to it I didn't know if
 
07:00:48.770 --> 07:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
I may so we can move on because it has
 
07:00:50.208 --> 07:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this I'm not sure if
 
07:00:52.430 --> 07:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
you can get me some data on that I would
 
07:00:54.708 --> 07:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate it later on because then
 
07:00:57.110 --> 07:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
you'll be good education for us yeah but
 
07:00:59.270 --> 07:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
rep you have a question uh thank you Mr
 
07:01:01.610 --> 07:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question I'll
 
07:01:04.368 --> 07:01:04.378 align:start position:0%
preface it by saying I I love I love
 
07:01:06.410 --> 07:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
this bill I would have been happy to
 
07:01:09.410 --> 07:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
have been a co-sponsor I think it's
 
07:01:09.420 --> 07:01:11.090 align:start position:0%
have been a co-sponsor I think it's
wonderful

07:01:11.090 --> 07:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
07:01:11.100 --> 07:01:12.048 align:start position:0%
wonderful
um

07:01:12.048 --> 07:01:12.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:14.930 --> 07:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative deseed's already
 
07:01:16.548 --> 07:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
touched on one of one of my questions
 
07:01:19.250 --> 07:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
about possibly this being a veterans
 
07:01:21.650 --> 07:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
committee state federal to have a
 
07:01:24.310 --> 07:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
veteran or some veterans presence so I
 
07:01:26.868 --> 07:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
now that the committee will have the
 
07:01:29.810 --> 07:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
bill maybe uh it could be somehow uh
 
07:01:32.930 --> 07:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
that's up to you uh amended in that
 
07:01:32.940 --> 07:01:34.010 align:start position:0%
that's up to you uh amended in that
fashion

07:01:34.010 --> 07:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a great idea I think
 
07:01:38.090 --> 07:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative Deshay said on what I
 
07:01:40.548 --> 07:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
think is a wonderful idea anyway I see
 
07:01:42.590 --> 07:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
that you have the Secretary of State or
 
07:01:45.048 --> 07:01:45.058 align:start position:0%
designee I'm not sure if secretary
 
07:01:46.670 --> 07:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
Gardner was Secretary of State at that
 
07:01:49.128 --> 07:01:49.138 align:start position:0%
time I think he came in just just after
 
07:01:52.190 --> 07:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
that but I I like that but I also wanted
 
07:01:54.110 --> 07:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
to just ask and I guess that would be up
 
07:01:55.910 --> 07:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee now but the uh the
 
07:01:58.010 --> 07:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
three New Hampshire signers
 
07:02:00.288 --> 07:02:00.298 align:start position:0%
um Matthew Thornton William Whipple and
 
07:02:02.170 --> 07:02:02.180 align:start position:0%
uh Josiah Bartlett
 
07:02:05.330 --> 07:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh presumably hopefully have some
 
07:02:07.070 --> 07:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
descendants I don't know who or where
 
07:02:09.230 --> 07:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
they are but I also like the idea which
 
07:02:11.270 --> 07:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we could talk about if if we can
 
07:02:14.868 --> 07:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
find their descendants uh and involve
 
07:02:16.850 --> 07:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
them I think maybe that's something we
 
07:02:19.368 --> 07:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
maybe could could talk about as well so
 
07:02:23.208 --> 07:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
anyway uh that was my question is is do
 
07:02:25.250 --> 07:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
you think that it would be how would you
 
07:02:27.530 --> 07:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
feel this being your bill if we tried to
 
07:02:30.048 --> 07:02:30.058 align:start position:0%
integrate descendants of signers if you
 
07:02:32.150 --> 07:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
can track them down that's fine so yeah
 
07:02:35.330 --> 07:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's good but no objection I have no
 
07:02:38.628 --> 07:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
objection to the idea thank you but they
 
07:02:40.310 --> 07:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
could always be honorary speakers and
 
07:02:42.048 --> 07:02:42.058 align:start position:0%
everything that the committee could put
 
07:02:44.150 --> 07:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
together on is there okay is there any
 
07:02:47.448 --> 07:02:47.458 align:start position:0%
other questions or anything for
 
07:02:48.890 --> 07:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you I appreciate it
 
07:02:50.990 --> 07:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you if you have some history of the
 
07:02:53.628 --> 07:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
Indians I'd be interested in reading
 
07:02:55.490 --> 07:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
that because of you know I was very
 
07:02:57.048 --> 07:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
interested in when I had that hearing
 
07:03:00.948 --> 07:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:04.190 --> 07:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry go ahead another question
 
07:03:05.690 --> 07:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
um it's not a question but I just want
 
07:03:07.190 --> 07:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
to thank you for bringing this this is
 
07:03:10.010 --> 07:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh important to celebrate our history so
 
07:03:13.548 --> 07:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
I appreciate this yes I'm I'm surprised
 
07:03:15.048 --> 07:03:15.058 align:start position:0%
I was the one who brought it up but I
 
07:03:16.310 --> 07:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
was just also just sort of looking
 
07:03:18.770 --> 07:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
forward to well things that would Unite
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
about the you know about the United part
 
07:03:22.310 --> 07:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the United States which we've been
 
07:03:24.048 --> 07:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
kind of divided and things have been in
 
07:03:25.730 --> 07:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
chaos in the last few years and also
 
07:03:27.890 --> 07:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
this looked like something that probably
 
07:03:30.230 --> 07:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
if we'd had like a normal the last few
 
07:03:31.490 --> 07:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
years have been normal we probably would
 
07:03:32.990 --> 07:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
have done this a few years ago but it
 
07:03:35.330 --> 07:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
just also occurs just I think got lost
 
07:03:38.390 --> 07:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the shuffle you know we were past you
 
07:03:39.350 --> 07:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
know this
 
07:03:41.150 --> 07:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
this year has been crazy enough and it's
 
07:03:43.010 --> 07:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
normal compared to the two previous two
 
07:03:44.448 --> 07:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
years so you know I think a lot of
 
07:03:44.458 --> 07:03:45.110 align:start position:0%
years so you know I think a lot of
things

07:03:45.110 --> 07:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
07:03:46.850 --> 07:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
this is like a little bit of unfinished
 
07:03:48.170 --> 07:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
business that should have been done
 
07:03:50.570 --> 07:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
earlier but better now than later better
 
07:03:52.368 --> 07:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
now than never bringing it Forward there
 
07:03:55.368 --> 07:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
and with that no more questions thank
 
07:03:57.530 --> 07:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Hogan
 
07:04:00.048 --> 07:04:00.058 align:start position:0%
with that I would like to my friend
 
07:04:02.868 --> 07:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
Janet wall
 
07:04:04.910 --> 07:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
you did a great job as a chairman in
 
07:04:07.070 --> 07:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislative admin so I welcome you to my
 
07:04:07.080 --> 07:04:12.610 align:start position:0%
legislative admin so I welcome you to my
committee

07:04:12.610 --> 07:04:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:15.350 --> 07:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good to see everyone
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
again for the record I'm Janet wall I
 
07:04:20.810 --> 07:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
represent Durham and Madbury and I
 
07:04:23.270 --> 07:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
signed on to this bill because I'm very
 
07:04:25.730 --> 07:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
interested in the concept of it the bill
 
07:04:27.468 --> 07:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
is flawed
 
07:04:30.890 --> 07:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative Morgan I respect
 
07:04:32.690 --> 07:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
all the people who have worked on this
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill especially the legislative service
 
07:04:37.910 --> 07:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
attorney who drafted it but it is flawed
 
07:04:40.490 --> 07:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph almost ends in what
 
07:04:41.930 --> 07:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
we would consider something like a
 
07:04:44.390 --> 07:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
dangling participle because it talks
 
07:04:44.400 --> 07:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
dangling participle because it talks
about

07:04:45.230 --> 07:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:04:48.048 --> 07:04:48.058 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines six through ten he
 
07:04:50.810 --> 07:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
talks about the American Revolution and
 
07:04:53.510 --> 07:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the events leading up to and including
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
the signing of the Declaration of
 
07:04:57.410 --> 07:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
Independence but then it talks about at
 
07:05:00.350 --> 07:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
the tail end a particular attention how
 
07:05:01.968 --> 07:05:01.978 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was involved but it
 
07:05:03.590 --> 07:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't say in Fault With the events
 
07:05:06.350 --> 07:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
leading up to and including the signing
 
07:05:08.270 --> 07:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's just I I played with some of the
 
07:05:10.670 --> 07:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
language on it and I'm willing to work
 
07:05:13.250 --> 07:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
with anyone on an amendment um there's a
 
07:05:16.250 --> 07:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
way to take that final
 
07:05:16.260 --> 07:05:17.510 align:start position:0%
way to take that final
um

07:05:17.510 --> 07:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:19.670 --> 07:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
phrase with particular attention to the
 
07:05:21.230 --> 07:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
ways in which New Hampshire was involved
 
07:05:23.750 --> 07:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
and put it further up in the paragraph
 
07:05:25.730 --> 07:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
So it shows the way New Hampshire was
 
07:05:27.590 --> 07:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
involved with events leading up to and
 
07:05:29.750 --> 07:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
including and signing the Declaration of
 
07:05:31.490 --> 07:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
Independence I think there's a way to
 
07:05:33.890 --> 07:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
take the wording we have here
 
07:05:36.890 --> 07:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
and clarify this so that people realize
 
07:05:38.390 --> 07:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're not just working on the
 
07:05:40.128 --> 07:05:40.138 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence but but
 
07:05:44.090 --> 07:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
indeed the events leading up too so I I
 
07:05:46.250 --> 07:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
just say this is a very awkward
 
07:05:48.708 --> 07:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph for such an
 
07:05:50.150 --> 07:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
important group of people to work
 
07:05:52.310 --> 07:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
together I served on the Lincoln
 
07:05:55.310 --> 07:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
commission and I want to say that the
 
07:05:56.930 --> 07:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
number of members on this commission is
 
07:05:59.750 --> 07:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
not unusual but I didn't bring that
 
07:06:02.090 --> 07:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
legislation in to show you it's up to
 
07:06:03.650 --> 07:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
the committee I would get it if you want
 
07:06:07.150 --> 07:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
it to see who was included in that
 
07:06:09.708 --> 07:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
because that might help the committee in
 
07:06:12.110 --> 07:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the membership and in terms of
 
07:06:14.930 --> 07:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
the membership there is an error on page
 
07:06:17.628 --> 07:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
two lines two and three
 
07:06:19.310 --> 07:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
the first meeting of the commission
 
07:06:21.708 --> 07:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
shall be called by the member of The
 
07:06:24.890 --> 07:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative historic committee I'm
 
07:06:26.690 --> 07:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
on that committee I have been for a long
 
07:06:28.730 --> 07:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
time but that committee is not mentioned
 
07:06:32.150 --> 07:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
as being part of this Commission
 
07:06:35.650 --> 07:06:35.660 align:start position:0%
and so I think that where was that again
 
07:06:37.968 --> 07:06:37.978 align:start position:0%
lines two and three a member of The
 
07:06:40.208 --> 07:06:40.218 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative historical committee
 
07:06:43.190 --> 07:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I can't find it listed as a member
 
07:06:45.708 --> 07:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
07:06:48.708 --> 07:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
I see Department of Natural and cultural
 
07:06:51.530 --> 07:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
resources I see house members senate
 
07:06:53.930 --> 07:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
members but I don't see anything about
 
07:06:56.990 --> 07:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
the joint historic committee so is it
 
07:06:59.330 --> 07:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
possible I mean to say you're going to
 
07:07:01.788 --> 07:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
be working on the amendment right uh
 
07:07:03.468 --> 07:07:03.478 align:start position:0%
yeah we can um it sounds like
 
07:07:05.090 --> 07:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative walls get a lot of
 
07:07:06.770 --> 07:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
experience in this area maybe you can
 
07:07:08.930 --> 07:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
communicate with her and come up with
 
07:07:11.570 --> 07:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
the right Amendment yeah I have some
 
07:07:13.548 --> 07:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
stuff written down right now and I know
 
07:07:16.250 --> 07:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
you have some language already for the
 
07:07:18.350 --> 07:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
um for the uh what's it called for the
 
07:07:19.910 --> 07:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
updated language of paragraph one I
 
07:07:21.708 --> 07:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
think we could add sorry you know I know
 
07:07:23.150 --> 07:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm interjecting all of a sudden but um
 
07:07:25.128 --> 07:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
I think we can add two members from each
 
07:07:26.868 --> 07:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
one from each party from the join um
 
07:07:28.250 --> 07:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
historical commission that you just
 
07:07:31.310 --> 07:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned no no no you don't think that
 
07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
daughter respect Mr chairman and
 
07:07:34.850 --> 07:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
07:07:36.110 --> 07:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
a joint historical legislative committee
 
07:07:42.468 --> 07:07:42.478 align:start position:0%
and with it has senators and it has
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
State reps
 
07:07:46.490 --> 07:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
and you can't just I mean you could very
 
07:07:48.288 --> 07:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
well draw one of the members of that and
 
07:07:50.868 --> 07:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
put it in with this language here but it
 
07:07:52.128 --> 07:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
07:07:55.730 --> 07:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
if you need that member to call the
 
07:07:57.590 --> 07:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
first meeting that member needs to be
 
07:07:59.810 --> 07:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
listed as a member of this commission
 
07:08:02.510 --> 07:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that member is not listed
 
07:08:04.850 --> 07:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of that
 
07:08:06.468 --> 07:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm confused now that's what I
 
07:08:08.810 --> 07:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
meant like in the amendment we add
 
07:08:10.910 --> 07:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know people from that joint
 
07:08:14.030 --> 07:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee to the commission
 
07:08:15.890 --> 07:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
we don't usually leave things like that
 
07:08:18.948 --> 07:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
to chance we're usually very specific in
 
07:08:22.490 --> 07:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
terms of who is a member of what I think
 
07:08:24.830 --> 07:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman understands that
 
07:08:26.868 --> 07:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not just saying well golly
 
07:08:28.430 --> 07:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
gee whiz will choose somebody and
 
07:08:30.170 --> 07:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're from that committee
 
07:08:32.930 --> 07:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I respect what you're saying because
 
07:08:34.968 --> 07:08:34.978 align:start position:0%
of the number you'll be having from the
 
07:08:36.830 --> 07:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate but at the same
 
07:08:39.770 --> 07:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
time it's very important when you have a
 
07:08:41.930 --> 07:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
member from The Joint historical
 
07:08:45.110 --> 07:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee listed as a member not by name
 
07:08:47.390 --> 07:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
but listed as a position on the
 
07:08:49.788 --> 07:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
committee because that number is calling
 
07:08:52.250 --> 07:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
the first meeting and that's
 
07:08:54.708 --> 07:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
traditionally what we do here
 
07:08:57.530 --> 07:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm right okay
 
07:08:59.208 --> 07:08:59.218 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to um do and I
 
07:09:00.288 --> 07:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing this up with
 
07:09:03.048 --> 07:09:03.058 align:start position:0%
your years of experience on this here
 
07:09:05.090 --> 07:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
um is it possible like I said that you
 
07:09:07.490 --> 07:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
could representative shakes to make sure
 
07:09:09.230 --> 07:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
because it's it's very important for us
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
to get the right language out of this
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee and not something that's half
 
07:09:15.770 --> 07:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
but half-assed uh you know that we're
 
07:09:18.590 --> 07:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
putting out so uh it would be beneficial
 
07:09:21.590 --> 07:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
for this here and for the future of this
 
07:09:23.330 --> 07:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
um you know anniversary of the
 
07:09:26.090 --> 07:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
Declaration to be done properly to sit
 
07:09:28.788 --> 07:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
down if possible will representative the
 
07:09:30.230 --> 07:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
shares it may be somebody else on your
 
07:09:32.510 --> 07:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
side that want to sit down and help with
 
07:09:34.490 --> 07:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
that amendment to make sure and we'll
 
07:09:37.910 --> 07:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
we'll exec this on next Friday uh to do
 
07:09:40.128 --> 07:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
it proper and do it right because I I
 
07:09:42.048 --> 07:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
support the bill yeah but I just want to
 
07:09:43.430 --> 07:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not embarrassed setting
 
07:09:45.230 --> 07:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
something out that's not proper hey can
 
07:09:47.208 --> 07:09:47.218 align:start position:0%
I and I respect you because you've been
 
07:09:48.770 --> 07:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
around a long time and you've been
 
07:09:51.170 --> 07:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
involved thank you I would be very happy
 
07:09:53.510 --> 07:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
to do that and again I
 
07:09:55.310 --> 07:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know the language for that first
 
07:09:57.530 --> 07:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
paragraph we really do need to clean
 
07:09:59.990 --> 07:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
that up and make it and to clarify it
 
07:10:01.670 --> 07:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
right and I think we can do that and
 
07:10:04.368 --> 07:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
again I had thought of proposing an
 
07:10:06.110 --> 07:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment just to add that member from
 
07:10:07.730 --> 07:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative historical
 
07:10:10.490 --> 07:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee but then that put 16 onto this
 
07:10:12.288 --> 07:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
commission and usually we have an odd
 
07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
number as opposed to an even number and
 
07:10:16.548 --> 07:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
I can get information from the Lincoln
 
07:10:16.558 --> 07:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
I can get information from the Lincoln
Commission

07:10:17.750 --> 07:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
07:10:20.750 --> 07:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we had setting that up back
 
07:10:23.090 --> 07:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
when as to how they did that if you
 
07:10:24.948 --> 07:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
would want yeah I'd be interested to see
 
07:10:27.530 --> 07:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
a copy of that okay yeah I I bought can
 
07:10:29.750 --> 07:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I apologize for the drafting errors I
 
07:10:31.430 --> 07:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
agree 100 with what representative wall
 
07:10:33.288 --> 07:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
just said about the historical
 
07:10:35.990 --> 07:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
commission so yes and I'm sorry okay
 
07:10:37.548 --> 07:10:37.558 align:start position:0%

07:10:39.230 --> 07:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's honestly I'm glad
 
07:10:41.270 --> 07:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you have some experience here that
 
07:10:43.250 --> 07:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
you brought on board with it and I'm
 
07:10:44.810 --> 07:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
sure if mod Schmidt was here forget
 
07:10:47.750 --> 07:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
about it you know I mean he'd be rocking
 
07:10:49.910 --> 07:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
my boat yeah I was around when it was
 
07:10:53.150 --> 07:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
signed yeah well actually I will put one
 
07:10:54.890 --> 07:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
personal thing in I am a daughter of the
 
07:10:57.110 --> 07:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
American Revolution uh colonel stittney
 
07:10:59.390 --> 07:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
from here in Concord was my ancestor so
 
07:11:02.390 --> 07:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
since he's talking about his father
 
07:11:04.850 --> 07:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
um you know this is important but it's
 
07:11:06.948 --> 07:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
not about me it's not about my ancestors
 
07:11:10.548 --> 07:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's about us right and um I and then
 
07:11:12.350 --> 07:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
someone asked me why are we asking for
 
07:11:14.448 --> 07:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
this so far in advance it takes a lot of
 
07:11:16.610 --> 07:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
time to get something big organized
 
07:11:18.770 --> 07:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
we've done it without the commissions on
 
07:11:21.530 --> 07:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
this stuff here before okay right so
 
07:11:24.708 --> 07:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
this is nothing new you're right
 
07:11:27.288 --> 07:11:27.298 align:start position:0%

do you oh you had a question
 
07:11:35.990 --> 07:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
if feeling does me uh would you believe
 
07:11:38.150 --> 07:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
that my uh fourth grade grandfather
 
07:11:40.910 --> 07:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
fought under uh Colonel Stickney at
 
07:11:43.910 --> 07:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bennington and uh they did fight in
 
07:11:45.708 --> 07:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
Bennington right directly under General
 
07:11:48.968 --> 07:11:48.978 align:start position:0%
Stark he was uh
 
07:11:51.650 --> 07:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
at Bennington under Colonel he was a
 
07:11:53.570 --> 07:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
stickney's militia at Bennington he was
 
07:11:55.850 --> 07:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
my fourth great grandfather my fifth
 
07:11:58.010 --> 07:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
grade grandfather would you believe was
 
07:12:00.410 --> 07:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
the first Deputy of the provincial
 
07:12:03.350 --> 07:12:03.360 align:start position:0%

07:12:05.350 --> 07:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
assembly in
 
07:12:08.390 --> 07:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
1775-76 so anyway uh would you believe
 
07:12:11.030 --> 07:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
so I believe that and I find it
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%

and let me see
 
07:13:07.730 --> 07:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
that was pretty interesting there uh
 
07:13:09.590 --> 07:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
you learn a lot in this committee here
 
07:13:11.090 --> 07:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
especially like I said I learned about
 
07:13:13.610 --> 07:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
the Indians and I didn't want to vote on
 
07:13:15.350 --> 07:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
something I had no clue on until we
 
07:13:17.390 --> 07:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
started doing some research
 
07:13:20.570 --> 07:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
and it was a good team effort
 
07:13:23.208 --> 07:13:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:23.218 --> 07:13:25.128 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:13:25.128 --> 07:13:25.138 align:start position:0%

07:13:33.110 --> 07:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
seven minutes four fifteen so I don't
 
07:13:35.090 --> 07:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
think I can get the exec done on the
 
07:13:36.350 --> 07:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
bill so I'll have to do it right after
 
07:13:37.548 --> 07:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
07:14:16.270 --> 07:14:16.280 align:start position:0%

time in just two years that this
 
07:19:43.430 --> 07:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee has heard the reasons why this
 
07:19:46.670 --> 07:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:48.468 --> 07:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
07:19:51.590 --> 07:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
immigrant-led households in the state
 
07:19:51.600 --> 07:19:53.030 align:start position:0%
immigrant-led households in the state
paid

07:19:53.030 --> 07:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
paid
 
07:19:53.040 --> 07:19:54.530 align:start position:0%
paid
six

07:19:54.530 --> 07:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
six
 
07:19:56.510 --> 07:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty eight point three
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal taxes and
 
07:20:04.310 --> 07:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
195.7 million in state and local taxes
 
07:20:07.250 --> 07:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
in 2018.
 
07:20:09.170 --> 07:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
that is
 
07:20:12.190 --> 07:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
um legal immigrant-led households
 
07:20:15.230 --> 07:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
undocumented undocumented immigrants in
 
07:20:17.930 --> 07:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire paid an estimate of 14.3
 
07:20:21.048 --> 07:20:21.058 align:start position:0%
million in federal taxes and 6.1 million
 
07:20:25.430 --> 07:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
in state and local taxes in 2018.
 
07:20:30.350 --> 07:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
in 2018 immigrants accounted for 21 of
 
07:20:33.110 --> 07:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
business owners small business owners in
 
07:20:37.510 --> 07:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:41.330 --> 07:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
I have tried very very hard to get the
 
07:20:44.208 --> 07:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
raw data on exactly how much our
 
07:20:46.788 --> 07:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are spending
 
07:20:48.948 --> 07:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
on deporting people
 
07:20:51.048 --> 07:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
whether it's putting the family that's
 
07:20:52.850 --> 07:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
left behind because they are U.S
 
07:20:55.368 --> 07:20:55.378 align:start position:0%
citizens on food stamps whether it's
 
07:20:57.890 --> 07:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
paying their heat and electric bills in
 
07:21:00.350 --> 07:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
their groceries whether it's
 
07:21:02.930 --> 07:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
adding to Public School Systems because
 
07:21:07.548 --> 07:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
their education is delayed from trauma
 
07:21:10.190 --> 07:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
I cannot find that research and I think
 
07:21:11.810 --> 07:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
it's imperative
 
07:21:15.830 --> 07:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
for our state to know where our money's
 
07:21:19.670 --> 07:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
going in an honest way
 
07:21:23.270 --> 07:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
we can't blindly be throwing money away
 
07:21:29.868 --> 07:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:31.968 --> 07:21:31.978 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time well
 
07:21:34.250 --> 07:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you take questions
 
07:21:34.260 --> 07:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you take questions
sure

07:21:35.270 --> 07:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
07:21:37.968 --> 07:21:37.978 align:start position:0%
okay I as you know I've been on this
 
07:21:39.948 --> 07:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
committee for 15 years as you say this
 
07:21:41.868 --> 07:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
has come to me many times
 
07:21:44.990 --> 07:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
and every time you come the bill comes
 
07:21:46.850 --> 07:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
here I sit and I think wow you already
 
07:21:48.770 --> 07:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
did your homework you already did the
 
07:21:50.868 --> 07:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
study you already have the data you
 
07:21:53.510 --> 07:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
already know but then when I think about
 
07:21:56.628 --> 07:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
it the U.S Constitution as I stated
 
07:21:58.368 --> 07:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
before and I'm only doing this for my
 
07:22:00.230 --> 07:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is a lot of new members
 
07:22:02.930 --> 07:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
here and they put 150 in what they're
 
07:22:06.350 --> 07:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
doing that the U.S Constitution talks
 
07:22:08.690 --> 07:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
about it's the federal government
 
07:22:11.448 --> 07:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
okay we already know we have no control
 
07:22:13.788 --> 07:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
over deporting I fought for
 
07:22:16.070 --> 07:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
a family in my neighborhood that I
 
07:22:17.448 --> 07:22:17.458 align:start position:0%
always thought were citizens I never
 
07:22:19.128 --> 07:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
knew that they weren't the children were
 
07:22:22.548 --> 07:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
because they were born I guess their
 
07:22:24.110 --> 07:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
mother came over here pregnant and then
 
07:22:26.090 --> 07:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
had the baby and they ended up getting
 
07:22:28.368 --> 07:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
educated and everything owned a home in
 
07:22:30.350 --> 07:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
my district but the federal government
 
07:22:32.090 --> 07:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
came in and kicked them out there was
 
07:22:33.708 --> 07:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
nothing we could do
 
07:22:36.708 --> 07:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
um you know and we have no control over
 
07:22:39.230 --> 07:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
it it's a federal issue so this is why
 
07:22:41.510 --> 07:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
you just keep coming to us here
 
07:22:44.090 --> 07:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
we have two senators and two
 
07:22:46.610 --> 07:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
congresswomen that Democrats and they've
 
07:22:49.670 --> 07:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
been in charge for many a long time have
 
07:22:53.390 --> 07:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
you gone to them yes I have I'm on the
 
07:22:55.610 --> 07:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
record actually on WMUR you can look it
 
07:22:57.948 --> 07:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
up it's on YouTube calling out all four
 
07:22:59.990 --> 07:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
of their names to do more and to
 
07:23:02.330 --> 07:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
research this
 
07:23:04.788 --> 07:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay and um for the record sorry to
 
07:23:07.128 --> 07:23:07.138 align:start position:0%
interrupt chair I just want to say this
 
07:23:10.610 --> 07:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect deportation at all as is
 
07:23:12.410 --> 07:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
the federal government's responsibility
 
07:23:14.448 --> 07:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
this is simply
 
07:23:18.230 --> 07:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
a free study committee that volunteers
 
07:23:22.690 --> 07:23:22.700 align:start position:0%
will put in their time to gather data on
 
07:23:26.628 --> 07:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
where our people's money is going and I
 
07:23:29.270 --> 07:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
think that is our responsibility as a
 
07:23:29.280 --> 07:23:30.708 align:start position:0%
think that is our responsibility as a
state

07:23:30.708 --> 07:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:23:33.048 --> 07:23:33.058 align:start position:0%
when you say our people are you talking
 
07:23:35.448 --> 07:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
like for instance the taxpayers money to
 
07:23:38.390 --> 07:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
pay and educate people that come over
 
07:23:40.968 --> 07:23:40.978 align:start position:0%
our country illegal is that what you're
 
07:23:42.110 --> 07:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
talking about we want to figure out how
 
07:23:44.510 --> 07:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
much dollars are going into that
 
07:23:47.570 --> 07:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
I want to go I want to know how much
 
07:23:49.490 --> 07:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're spending on taking care of the
 
07:23:51.650 --> 07:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
families that are left behind after we
 
07:23:54.770 --> 07:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
Deport a primary bread earner
 
07:23:57.590 --> 07:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
07:23:57.600 --> 07:23:59.390 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
um yes

07:23:59.390 --> 07:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
07:24:01.968 --> 07:24:01.978 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Nicole
 
07:24:03.890 --> 07:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
for a representative Klein Knight for
 
07:24:05.750 --> 07:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
07:24:05.760 --> 07:24:06.410 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

07:24:06.410 --> 07:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:08.270 --> 07:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I think I think this is a clarifying
 
07:24:11.030 --> 07:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
question so it is we are we're studying
 
07:24:13.548 --> 07:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
not the impact on the federal government
 
07:24:16.310 --> 07:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
but rather the impact on our state and
 
07:24:18.890 --> 07:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
local municipalities and studying you
 
07:24:21.170 --> 07:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
know whether it's you know we have to
 
07:24:24.350 --> 07:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
provide uh shelters whether we have to
 
07:24:26.570 --> 07:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
provide if that family all of a sudden
 
07:24:30.708 --> 07:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
no longer can pay like so where so would
 
07:24:32.208 --> 07:24:32.218 align:start position:0%
you say that we're really kind of
 
07:24:34.968 --> 07:24:34.978 align:start position:0%
studying like what happens to our state
 
07:24:36.410 --> 07:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
after this happens
 
07:24:38.208 --> 07:24:38.218 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
07:24:41.448 --> 07:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative I think um it affects our
 
07:24:43.788 --> 07:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
budget where our money goes how much
 
07:24:45.770 --> 07:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
money is going to the food stamp program
 
07:24:47.330 --> 07:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
how much money is going to public
 
07:24:50.150 --> 07:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
education special education housing
 
07:24:54.468 --> 07:24:54.478 align:start position:0%
costs for families that can no longer do
 
07:24:56.410 --> 07:24:56.420 align:start position:0%
not have a supporter
 
07:25:01.490 --> 07:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
and if 21 of New England businesses rely
 
07:25:01.500 --> 07:25:03.010 align:start position:0%
and if 21 of New England businesses rely
on

07:25:03.010 --> 07:25:03.020 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:25:05.930 --> 07:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
immigration and immigrants to do the
 
07:25:07.430 --> 07:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
work that nobody wants to do
 
07:25:11.048 --> 07:25:11.058 align:start position:0%
specifically health care workers nurses
 
07:25:14.330 --> 07:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
labor force workers a lot of small
 
07:25:17.030 --> 07:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
businesses depend on these people and
 
07:25:19.910 --> 07:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
even though they they might be getting
 
07:25:22.250 --> 07:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
paid in a certain way they're
 
07:25:25.128 --> 07:25:25.138 align:start position:0%
contributing taxes they're helping us
 
07:25:27.708 --> 07:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
get money and then we are shooting
 
07:25:30.708 --> 07:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
ourselves in the foot and locally it's
 
07:25:33.650 --> 07:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
unfair to our constituents not to study
 
07:25:36.830 --> 07:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
this and that's all this bill does and
 
07:25:39.770 --> 07:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
by refusing to study something like this
 
07:25:42.890 --> 07:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
is a slap in the face to the money of
 
07:25:46.670 --> 07:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:49.010 --> 07:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
07:25:51.110 --> 07:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for recognizing Mr chairman
 
07:25:52.490 --> 07:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Klein
 
07:25:54.410 --> 07:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
Knight for taking my question I was
 
07:25:57.468 --> 07:25:57.478 align:start position:0%
wondering on um on line 10 under duties
 
07:26:00.230 --> 07:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
it says uh quote the committee shall the
 
07:26:01.968 --> 07:26:01.978 align:start position:0%
effects of deportation of primary
 
07:26:03.890 --> 07:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
earners on family members who are United
 
07:26:06.410 --> 07:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
States citizens I I believe this is a
 
07:26:09.048 --> 07:26:09.058 align:start position:0%
typo did you bring an amendment prepared
 
07:26:11.330 --> 07:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
for making the correction I did not it
 
07:26:12.948 --> 07:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
was a big catch
 
07:26:17.390 --> 07:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I would go I will gladly do that if I
 
07:26:19.310 --> 07:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
am allowed to do that
 
07:26:21.948 --> 07:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that a typo should
 
07:26:23.750 --> 07:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
warrant the death of such an important
 
07:26:26.390 --> 07:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill to our taxpayers
 
07:26:28.190 --> 07:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:31.430 --> 07:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative thank
 
07:26:34.010 --> 07:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for recognizing me thank
 
07:26:36.350 --> 07:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Klein Knight for
 
07:26:40.070 --> 07:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
presenting this I just to uh maybe I
 
07:26:41.690 --> 07:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
could just tell you a short very short
 
07:26:45.110 --> 07:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
story and see what you if this is
 
07:26:47.270 --> 07:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to what you're saying there was
 
07:26:50.810 --> 07:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
a family in Milford eliasar Ayala this
 
07:26:53.770 --> 07:26:53.780 align:start position:0%
hit the press this is a big story
 
07:26:57.288 --> 07:26:57.298 align:start position:0%
where he was stopped for some routine
 
07:27:00.350 --> 07:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
Road stop
 
07:27:04.430 --> 07:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
um he had come as a teenager a young
 
07:27:07.730 --> 07:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
teenager to the U.S was not fully
 
07:27:11.150 --> 07:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
documented he had I think four children
 
07:27:14.628 --> 07:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
all of whom were U.S citizens he was
 
07:27:17.270 --> 07:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
then ended up in an ice facility for a
 
07:27:20.990 --> 07:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
year I was only I I became involved when
 
07:27:24.288 --> 07:27:24.298 align:start position:0%
to consult with the school district as
 
07:27:25.910 --> 07:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
the kids started to develop
 
07:27:27.770 --> 07:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
school-related problems because their
 
07:27:30.288 --> 07:27:30.298 align:start position:0%
father was away they also you know the
 
07:27:32.930 --> 07:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
old well the sun started had to go get a
 
07:27:35.330 --> 07:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
job to support the family family was
 
07:27:37.368 --> 07:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
under tremendous strain food stamps the
 
07:27:38.448 --> 07:27:38.458 align:start position:0%
whole thing that they had never done
 
07:27:40.070 --> 07:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
before because the father
 
07:27:43.910 --> 07:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
had been a a good supporter of the
 
07:27:46.128 --> 07:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
family so I'm wondering about school
 
07:27:48.410 --> 07:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
costs and IEP costs suddenly all the
 
07:27:49.850 --> 07:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
kids are on IEPs because they're
 
07:27:52.690 --> 07:27:52.700 align:start position:0%
developing mental health problems and
 
07:27:54.530 --> 07:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
psychologists are involved in special
 
07:27:56.750 --> 07:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
education is involved whereas previously
 
07:27:58.730 --> 07:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
they had not been involved is that the
 
07:28:01.128 --> 07:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and I wonder what is it
 
07:28:02.990 --> 07:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Ayala multiplied by what kind of a
 
07:28:05.330 --> 07:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
number but I have no idea we're talking
 
07:28:07.788 --> 07:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
about millions of our of our taxpayers
 
07:28:10.850 --> 07:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
dollars right now
 
07:28:13.430 --> 07:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm just so is that the time in
 
07:28:17.150 --> 07:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
order to to really dive into that we
 
07:28:19.730 --> 07:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
would need the study committee
 
07:28:22.788 --> 07:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
if I if I may ask um
 
07:28:25.010 --> 07:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
once you do the study and you find out
 
07:28:26.570 --> 07:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay millions of dollars which you
 
07:28:27.788 --> 07:28:27.798 align:start position:0%
already know you already got that answer
 
07:28:29.990 --> 07:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
coming in here
 
07:28:32.628 --> 07:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
what then what's this what does it prove
 
07:28:33.948 --> 07:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
what does it do
 
07:28:36.468 --> 07:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
well it would assist our federal
 
07:28:38.090 --> 07:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
government as you say in their
 
07:28:41.030 --> 07:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make changes
 
07:28:43.788 --> 07:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
okay now my next thing to add is because
 
07:28:45.830 --> 07:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
like I said see in this here coming many
 
07:28:48.650 --> 07:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
times in the same time we've had Senator
 
07:28:52.010 --> 07:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
Shaheen Senna Hassan Uh custom I can't
 
07:28:53.690 --> 07:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
believe because he's only been there two
 
07:28:55.490 --> 07:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
terms I think and maybe come to his
 
07:28:58.010 --> 07:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
flights with him but
 
07:28:59.448 --> 07:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
how come
 
07:29:01.548 --> 07:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
they can't get the answer it's a federal
 
07:29:03.230 --> 07:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
issues this is what I'm trying to get
 
07:29:06.170 --> 07:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
across no matter how much we study this
 
07:29:08.410 --> 07:29:08.420 align:start position:0%
issue it's still
 
07:29:11.510 --> 07:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
immigration is a federal issue uh
 
07:29:13.910 --> 07:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
welfare department studies involved with
 
07:29:16.430 --> 07:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
this stuff uh you know with TANF and all
 
07:29:18.048 --> 07:29:18.058 align:start position:0%
that good stuff there the churches that
 
07:29:20.390 --> 07:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
we had the last time they know exactly
 
07:29:22.070 --> 07:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
who they have and who the workers are
 
07:29:23.570 --> 07:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
and who got deported
 
07:29:26.030 --> 07:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking
 
07:29:29.390 --> 07:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to simply not study
 
07:29:32.570 --> 07:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
this issue is doing a disservice to our
 
07:29:32.580 --> 07:29:35.810 align:start position:0%
this issue is doing a disservice to our
taxpayers

07:29:35.810 --> 07:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:39.350 --> 07:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Chase
 
07:29:41.208 --> 07:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
I just had a well thank you for
 
07:29:43.610 --> 07:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
recognizing me Mr chair and um thank you
 
07:29:44.868 --> 07:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
07:29:46.968 --> 07:29:46.978 align:start position:0%
Klein Knight I just had a question you
 
07:29:49.968 --> 07:29:49.978 align:start position:0%
really want a um a comprehensive study
 
07:29:52.910 --> 07:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like for this issue but um I'm
 
07:29:54.948 --> 07:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit com wouldn't a commission
 
07:29:57.530 --> 07:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
be even more comprehensive bringing in
 
07:29:58.788 --> 07:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders bringing the federal
 
07:30:01.010 --> 07:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
government maybe even bringing in people
 
07:30:04.070 --> 07:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
from you know the yeah from the uh well
 
07:30:05.570 --> 07:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
I know we wouldn't have the statutory
 
07:30:07.968 --> 07:30:07.978 align:start position:0%
power actually to do it but to request
 
07:30:10.548 --> 07:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
someone from the Senator's office either
 
07:30:11.930 --> 07:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
the Senators to come in I'm kind of
 
07:30:13.788 --> 07:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
confused this seems like
 
07:30:15.948 --> 07:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
um we might end up having legislators
 
07:30:17.628 --> 07:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
who have no purview over this issue
 
07:30:19.548 --> 07:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
constitutionally based on the Commerce
 
07:30:22.310 --> 07:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
Clause giving a recommendation that can
 
07:30:25.310 --> 07:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
only be acted upon by federal officials
 
07:30:27.410 --> 07:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm confused why you didn't do a
 
07:30:27.420 --> 07:30:28.548 align:start position:0%
so I'm confused why you didn't do a
commission

07:30:28.548 --> 07:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:30:31.250 --> 07:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
07:30:32.990 --> 07:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and I can amend the language to
 
07:30:35.510 --> 07:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually include that so good catch on
 
07:30:38.090 --> 07:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
that but if I can't get a simple
 
07:30:41.650 --> 07:30:41.660 align:start position:0%
study committee response from this body
 
07:30:44.930 --> 07:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
there's I don't believe that such a
 
07:30:46.910 --> 07:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing like that you know going all the
 
07:30:49.490 --> 07:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
way it wouldn't make a difference I can
 
07:30:52.250 --> 07:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
put that in the language the intent will
 
07:30:55.850 --> 07:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
still be the same so what you decide if
 
07:30:58.548 --> 07:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is something worth studying is the
 
07:31:01.910 --> 07:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:04.490 --> 07:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Moffett thank you Mr
 
07:31:05.690 --> 07:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Klein
 
07:31:07.430 --> 07:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
I've taken my question
 
07:31:10.190 --> 07:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of comparable
 
07:31:12.170 --> 07:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
committees perhaps from other states
 
07:31:14.390 --> 07:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe have gotten into this area
 
07:31:16.788 --> 07:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
that might provide some sort of models
 
07:31:20.208 --> 07:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
for us to to look at they're all Loosely
 
07:31:23.990 --> 07:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
based basically they're saying you know
 
07:31:26.330 --> 07:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
we know we spend Millions on our our
 
07:31:29.030 --> 07:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we know we spend Millions
 
07:31:32.510 --> 07:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
on our budget to pay for rent and board
 
07:31:36.650 --> 07:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
and he we know we spend
 
07:31:40.510 --> 07:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
just we're hemorrhaging money but
 
07:31:44.930 --> 07:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
nobody's really been studying this at
 
07:31:47.448 --> 07:31:47.458 align:start position:0%
such an in-depth level for for state by
 
07:31:50.350 --> 07:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
state case basis there's a federal
 
07:31:53.750 --> 07:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
census and you can go to the the federal
 
07:31:56.570 --> 07:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
website for that and it'll show you how
 
07:32:00.048 --> 07:32:00.058 align:start position:0%
much we spend at the federal level to
 
07:32:02.090 --> 07:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
deport these people which is also this
 
07:32:04.010 --> 07:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
is billions of dollars so that's a
 
07:32:06.490 --> 07:32:06.500 align:start position:0%
separate thing as your chairman stated
 
07:32:08.570 --> 07:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
that is the federal government's
 
07:32:11.270 --> 07:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility but we would be leading
 
07:32:14.150 --> 07:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
the way for all 50 states
 
07:32:17.770 --> 07:32:17.780 align:start position:0%
to be fiscally responsible in showing
 
07:32:21.468 --> 07:32:21.478 align:start position:0%
that where our money is going how much
 
07:32:23.628 --> 07:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
we can do to help
 
07:32:25.968 --> 07:32:25.978 align:start position:0%
stop wasting it
 
07:32:28.850 --> 07:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
they follow up yeah so okay thank you
 
07:32:30.350 --> 07:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so what I'm hearing is that
 
07:32:32.330 --> 07:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
this you see this as being kind of a
 
07:32:34.730 --> 07:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
prototype and you you've looked into
 
07:32:36.948 --> 07:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
this and this has not been done to your
 
07:32:38.990 --> 07:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge in any other states like this
 
07:32:41.570 --> 07:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
so this so there is no model to look at
 
07:32:43.128 --> 07:32:43.138 align:start position:0%
this would be a prototype is what you're
 
07:32:46.368 --> 07:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
saying yeah and I don't think that there
 
07:32:48.948 --> 07:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
is anything wrong with studying how much
 
07:32:52.010 --> 07:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
money our taxpayers in New Hampshire are
 
07:32:54.170 --> 07:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
spending to take care of other people's
 
07:32:54.180 --> 07:32:56.628 align:start position:0%
spending to take care of other people's
families

07:32:56.628 --> 07:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
families
 
07:32:57.830 --> 07:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:32:59.628 --> 07:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
when you brought that up there first
 
07:33:01.670 --> 07:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
thing I did put a note here is stop
 
07:33:05.150 --> 07:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
wasting because on a study if in this
 
07:33:08.448 --> 07:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
study here if I as a taxpayer if the
 
07:33:10.368 --> 07:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
numbers came out and I was told how much
 
07:33:11.930 --> 07:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
money I'm paying now in your District
 
07:33:14.930 --> 07:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
Manchester I heard they got over 60 or
 
07:33:18.350 --> 07:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
70 different languages teachers they had
 
07:33:20.628 --> 07:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
to hire to support this
 
07:33:22.788 --> 07:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
don't you think that would be a red flag
 
07:33:25.250 --> 07:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
on this program that taxpayers will say
 
07:33:27.590 --> 07:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we're spending that much money now
 
07:33:30.288 --> 07:33:30.298 align:start position:0%
I see why our taxes are so high is that
 
07:33:32.270 --> 07:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for or I mean I'm
 
07:33:33.890 --> 07:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
confused on what you're actually looking
 
07:33:37.310 --> 07:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
for I'm looking for a way to show where
 
07:33:39.230 --> 07:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
our money's going in a transparent way
 
07:33:41.628 --> 07:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
and I think that we owe the people of
 
07:33:43.788 --> 07:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire transparency when we spend
 
07:33:46.368 --> 07:33:46.378 align:start position:0%
their money on on issues like this
 
07:33:47.868 --> 07:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
I think we had a question in the back
 
07:33:50.990 --> 07:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
there yes sir thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:33:54.530 --> 07:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
this it isn't so much a question but it
 
07:33:54.540 --> 07:33:56.208 align:start position:0%
this it isn't so much a question but it
perhaps

07:33:56.208 --> 07:33:56.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
07:33:59.208 --> 07:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
um an offer I'm I'm happy to draft an
 
07:34:02.810 --> 07:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill uh that turns the
 
07:34:04.610 --> 07:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
committee into a commission
 
07:34:07.548 --> 07:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
uh if we think that that's the route
 
07:34:09.288 --> 07:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
that we want to go it sounds like that
 
07:34:11.690 --> 07:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
could be helpful representative deshay's
 
07:34:13.490 --> 07:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
sound like you want to go in that
 
07:34:15.890 --> 07:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
direction if it by having some other
 
07:34:18.170 --> 07:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders come to the table we might
 
07:34:23.868 --> 07:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:23.878 --> 07:34:24.948 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:34:24.948 --> 07:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:34:27.530 --> 07:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask a question of the um of
 
07:34:29.030 --> 07:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Clem Knight real
 
07:34:31.010 --> 07:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
quick and thank you Mr chair I'm kind of
 
07:34:32.930 --> 07:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know I think more of what I was
 
07:34:34.430 --> 07:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get to was understand because
 
07:34:36.650 --> 07:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
this is very Broad in Latitude right
 
07:34:38.628 --> 07:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
07:34:40.548 --> 07:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
um you know a committee made up of
 
07:34:42.770 --> 07:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
legislators that have no purview over
 
07:34:45.770 --> 07:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
this issue that will be looking at the
 
07:34:47.868 --> 07:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
effects of deportation amongst primary
 
07:34:49.670 --> 07:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
earners family members who are U.S
 
07:34:51.830 --> 07:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
citizens in this entire State I hear you
 
07:34:52.850 --> 07:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
talking a lot about that you want to
 
07:34:55.430 --> 07:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
look at the costs so there's no there's
 
07:34:57.048 --> 07:34:57.058 align:start position:0%
nothing that's really narrowed the scope
 
07:35:00.110 --> 07:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
of this to the cost to taxpayers it just
 
07:35:02.690 --> 07:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
says you know to how it affects right an
 
07:35:04.430 --> 07:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
effect that could be socially
 
07:35:08.390 --> 07:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
emotionally cost logistically I mean
 
07:35:10.070 --> 07:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a whole bunch so I'm
 
07:35:11.150 --> 07:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
kind of confused because you're talking
 
07:35:14.030 --> 07:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
a lot about the tax costs why not narrow
 
07:35:16.850 --> 07:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
the scope of this to the cost to U.S
 
07:35:19.850 --> 07:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and I'm also and I'll you know
 
07:35:21.708 --> 07:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
I'll ask I'll make the question two-fold
 
07:35:23.690 --> 07:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
too has the federal government funded
 
07:35:25.670 --> 07:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
any studies to look at the cost of this
 
07:35:27.350 --> 07:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
or done any studies itself because they
 
07:35:29.150 --> 07:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
usually Federal government's a king of
 
07:35:31.190 --> 07:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
studies I'd be pretty hard-pressed not
 
07:35:32.750 --> 07:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
to imagine they haven't funded or at
 
07:35:34.310 --> 07:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
least a university that's publicly
 
07:35:36.410 --> 07:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
funded hasn't done a study on this
 
07:35:38.868 --> 07:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your two Quest
 
07:35:41.570 --> 07:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
two-parter representative
 
07:35:43.968 --> 07:35:43.978 align:start position:0%
um I'd be amenable to an amendment that
 
07:35:47.030 --> 07:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
narrows the scope to just our New
 
07:35:49.010 --> 07:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state taxes if you want to
 
07:35:50.510 --> 07:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
start there starting in the right
 
07:35:52.670 --> 07:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
direction is something and I'm always
 
07:35:54.708 --> 07:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
07:35:58.010 --> 07:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
um compromise on that and you know the
 
07:36:01.368 --> 07:36:01.378 align:start position:0%
other issues they can come in the next
 
07:36:04.670 --> 07:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
couple years or not at all the most
 
07:36:07.610 --> 07:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
important thing is here is how we're
 
07:36:10.490 --> 07:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
spending our our New Hampshire residents
 
07:36:12.788 --> 07:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
tax dollars so you're right
 
07:36:16.010 --> 07:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
and if that is okay with representative
 
07:36:19.850 --> 07:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm when he drafts an amendment to
 
07:36:22.128 --> 07:36:22.138 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope with with such language
 
07:36:24.708 --> 07:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
that you suggested that would be that
 
07:36:26.288 --> 07:36:26.298 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
07:36:29.690 --> 07:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
the other part of your question the
 
07:36:31.610 --> 07:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
federal government does
 
07:36:37.250 --> 07:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
tally the data on how a long residents
 
07:36:40.430 --> 07:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
stay so we're still paying but if we're
 
07:36:42.590 --> 07:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
paying federally for that that's a step
 
07:36:44.570 --> 07:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's the separate issue
 
07:36:47.030 --> 07:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
um your federal tax dollars are going to
 
07:36:47.040 --> 07:36:48.468 align:start position:0%
um your federal tax dollars are going to
house

07:36:48.468 --> 07:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
house
 
07:36:50.930 --> 07:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
um these immigrants until they're
 
07:36:54.288 --> 07:36:54.298 align:start position:0%
deported so you're paying for room and
 
07:36:56.390 --> 07:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
board and meals and they're plane
 
07:37:00.530 --> 07:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
tickets and that can take months to to
 
07:37:02.810 --> 07:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
even I've I've known some immigrants
 
07:37:05.930 --> 07:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
stay in the jail system or the
 
07:37:09.468 --> 07:37:09.478 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for a over a year or so it
 
07:37:12.230 --> 07:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
depends when it's available to deport
 
07:37:15.890 --> 07:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
them back to their origin not not every
 
07:37:18.890 --> 07:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
immigrant is from this same country that
 
07:37:22.788 --> 07:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
comes here so that is available online
 
07:37:25.490 --> 07:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
the census does the federal government
 
07:37:30.110 --> 07:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:32.390 --> 07:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong but I don't know if
 
07:37:34.010 --> 07:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in here is expert in
 
07:37:36.110 --> 07:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
this area but I thought if you weren't
 
07:37:38.208 --> 07:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have a green card or you
 
07:37:40.670 --> 07:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
were in a U.S citizen you didn't qualify
 
07:37:43.128 --> 07:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
for TANF in New Hampshire that any
 
07:37:44.930 --> 07:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
monies for this stuff they're bringing
 
07:37:46.968 --> 07:37:46.978 align:start position:0%
them with Federal money somebody help me
 
07:37:49.610 --> 07:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
out on that are you aware of that does
 
07:37:49.620 --> 07:37:50.810 align:start position:0%
out on that are you aware of that does
that

07:37:50.810 --> 07:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:37:50.820 --> 07:37:52.330 align:start position:0%
that
I

07:37:52.330 --> 07:37:52.340 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:37:55.548 --> 07:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
can't hear you I would probably assume
 
07:37:58.430 --> 07:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
that you yourself aren't uh probably
 
07:38:00.350 --> 07:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
can't get that but like like I said like
 
07:38:01.730 --> 07:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
most of the stuff in the bill would
 
07:38:04.190 --> 07:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
probably be your Offspring or like
 
07:38:05.810 --> 07:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
somebody in the family who is the U.S
 
07:38:08.208 --> 07:38:08.218 align:start position:0%
citizen would qualify for that I think
 
07:38:09.468 --> 07:38:09.478 align:start position:0%
that's the I think that's the issue is
 
07:38:11.930 --> 07:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
like these mixed status families you
 
07:38:13.368 --> 07:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
know it's you have a parent who's
 
07:38:15.830 --> 07:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
undocumented but then like a somebody
 
07:38:17.690 --> 07:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
else okay this is something I guess we
 
07:38:19.850 --> 07:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
can debate when we uh on the bill when
 
07:38:21.590 --> 07:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
we get forward I'm just putting it out
 
07:38:22.788 --> 07:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
there I'm hoping maybe you have an
 
07:38:25.310 --> 07:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
answer for that uh because are we gonna
 
07:38:27.170 --> 07:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
would this study start investigating
 
07:38:28.430 --> 07:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the federal government how
 
07:38:30.468 --> 07:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
much money they're bringing in here when
 
07:38:32.150 --> 07:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
they bring kids or whoever they're
 
07:38:34.250 --> 07:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
bringing in uh to the state
 
07:38:36.590 --> 07:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
it would look at where our taxes are
 
07:38:40.250 --> 07:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
going in terms of the budget on you know
 
07:38:43.930 --> 07:38:43.940 align:start position:0%
if there's a certain amount of U.S born
 
07:38:47.270 --> 07:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh children that were born to illegal
 
07:38:49.730 --> 07:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
immigrant status
 
07:38:53.270 --> 07:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
it would look at cost per family it
 
07:38:57.590 --> 07:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
would I hope determine exactly where our
 
07:38:58.968 --> 07:38:58.978 align:start position:0%
money's going
 
07:39:03.410 --> 07:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
um besides federal dollars but we have
 
07:39:06.530 --> 07:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
um we have that in I believe the fiscal
 
07:39:08.750 --> 07:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee could help us with
 
07:39:11.570 --> 07:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
how much we get in federal aid and where
 
07:39:14.690 --> 07:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
it goes every year so that that wouldn't
 
07:39:20.030 --> 07:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:21.708 --> 07:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
 
07:39:24.890 --> 07:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
um this is actually quite surprising uh
 
07:39:26.628 --> 07:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
that you asked that I was actually
 
07:39:28.250 --> 07:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the application for
 
07:39:30.530 --> 07:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
assistance yesterday because I I was
 
07:39:33.110 --> 07:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
applying and there is a question on
 
07:39:36.048 --> 07:39:36.058 align:start position:0%
state assistance that asks if you are a
 
07:39:39.230 --> 07:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
U.S citizen okay thank you I'm not
 
07:39:40.788 --> 07:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
familiar that's why I asked I thought
 
07:39:42.948 --> 07:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
you know somebody would know uh yes you
 
07:39:46.010 --> 07:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
had a representative for the yes uh
 
07:39:49.788 --> 07:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman my question is uh the
 
07:39:52.190 --> 07:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
reason if I'm understanding correctly
 
07:39:54.890 --> 07:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
the reason that this would be a state
 
07:39:57.770 --> 07:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
level committee is to really focus on
 
07:40:00.530 --> 07:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of the state on the burden uh
 
07:40:03.708 --> 07:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
or the burden of the state on these
 
07:40:05.330 --> 07:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
children that are are left behind in the
 
07:40:07.128 --> 07:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
United States is that correct
 
07:40:09.110 --> 07:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for your question
 
07:40:12.948 --> 07:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative yes especially we're in
 
07:40:15.650 --> 07:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
quite a bind right now as a state since
 
07:40:19.910 --> 07:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
we only get our tax stream from Raising
 
07:40:22.330 --> 07:40:22.340 align:start position:0%
property taxes it affects all of us here
 
07:40:24.770 --> 07:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
to keep doing that to take care of other
 
07:40:27.468 --> 07:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
people's families seems like a real
 
07:40:29.448 --> 07:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
egregious mistake on our parts as
 
07:40:29.458 --> 07:40:31.250 align:start position:0%
egregious mistake on our parts as
leaders

07:40:31.250 --> 07:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
07:40:34.610 --> 07:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair yes follow up good uh
 
07:40:37.070 --> 07:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
and this is a second question could the
 
07:40:38.448 --> 07:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
findings put more pressure on the
 
07:40:41.150 --> 07:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
delegation to actually act on this issue
 
07:40:44.650 --> 07:40:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:47.150 --> 07:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
dance help you out there what makes a
 
07:40:49.310 --> 07:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
difference is each and every one of you
 
07:40:51.048 --> 07:40:51.058 align:start position:0%
signing a letter and send it to your
 
07:40:54.350 --> 07:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
delegation and asking them for the help
 
07:40:56.270 --> 07:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
there because it's a shame because all
 
07:40:59.150 --> 07:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
if I was involved in like involved as
 
07:41:01.250 --> 07:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
heavy as you are I'd be over at the um
 
07:41:04.128 --> 07:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
Council and I'm talking with the people
 
07:41:05.628 --> 07:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
over there on the finances how much
 
07:41:07.670 --> 07:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
money is going out and I'd already know
 
07:41:08.868 --> 07:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even need a study committee
 
07:41:11.690 --> 07:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
and have to pay taxpayers money for it
 
07:41:15.048 --> 07:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
can I respond thank you so much chair so
 
07:41:16.910 --> 07:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I met with Annie Custer like I said
 
07:41:21.368 --> 07:41:21.378 align:start position:0%
I've been on our state TV asking
 
07:41:23.690 --> 07:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative Custer representative
 
07:41:23.700 --> 07:41:24.968 align:start position:0%
representative Custer representative
Pappas

07:41:24.968 --> 07:41:24.978 align:start position:0%
Pappas
 
07:41:28.910 --> 07:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Hassan and uh Senator Shaheen
 
07:41:31.430 --> 07:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
I've named them all by name and this was
 
07:41:34.010 --> 07:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago I've been at this for
 
07:41:36.468 --> 07:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
a very long time to show a
 
07:41:39.230 --> 07:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility well our responsibility
 
07:41:41.448 --> 07:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
is as Leaders where we're spending our
 
07:41:44.448 --> 07:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
people's money and how it affects the
 
07:41:47.570 --> 07:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
state and frankly again this doesn't
 
07:41:50.448 --> 07:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
harm anybody by getting that information
 
07:41:54.530 --> 07:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
and I have to say by not getting that
 
07:41:55.850 --> 07:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
information we're doing a great
 
07:41:59.150 --> 07:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
disservice to taxpayers of the state
 
07:42:01.250 --> 07:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you are there any other
 
07:42:01.260 --> 07:42:03.708 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you are there any other
questions

07:42:03.708 --> 07:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:42:07.430 --> 07:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
no what that uh I thank you for your uh
 
07:42:09.770 --> 07:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
testimony and seeing that when there's
 
07:42:14.330 --> 07:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:19.250 --> 07:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:20.690 --> 07:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for your time I

have to go back to myself you know I I I
 
07:42:26.448 --> 07:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
there's a great intentions if the
 
07:42:27.830 --> 07:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
federal government wasn't written the
 
07:42:29.330 --> 07:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution the way it is I'd be on
 
07:42:31.788 --> 07:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
this in a heartbeat would you but I
 
07:42:33.110 --> 07:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
would say what you're what are you
 
07:42:35.090 --> 07:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
afraid of finding out there's nothing
 
07:42:36.468 --> 07:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid of
 
07:42:38.930 --> 07:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
not doing then you would support this
 
07:42:40.490 --> 07:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah the only person I'm afraid of was
 
07:42:43.310 --> 07:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
my father and he's dead
 
07:42:43.320 --> 07:42:44.510 align:start position:0%
my father and he's dead
okay

07:42:44.510 --> 07:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:42:44.520 --> 07:43:05.288 align:start position:0%
okay
um

07:43:05.288 --> 07:43:05.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:07.968 --> 07:43:07.978 align:start position:0%

07:43:15.650 --> 07:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you for the
 
07:43:17.868 --> 07:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
opportunities pick up in support of this
 
07:43:17.878 --> 07:43:18.650 align:start position:0%
opportunities pick up in support of this
bill

07:43:18.650 --> 07:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:43:20.810 --> 07:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
the reason that I'm I'm speaking in
 
07:43:22.788 --> 07:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
support of this bill is because
 
07:43:26.150 --> 07:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
it is critical not for us to know
 
07:43:28.730 --> 07:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
exactly not only for us to know exactly
 
07:43:30.890 --> 07:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
how much money that we're spending to
 
07:43:33.948 --> 07:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
support this family after their uh
 
07:43:35.868 --> 07:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
someone who is the supporter for this
 
07:43:38.330 --> 07:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
family gets supported but it is critical
 
07:43:42.350 --> 07:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
for us to know how much taxes that these
 
07:43:44.690 --> 07:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
people pay and how many people how many
 
07:43:46.190 --> 07:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
of these people they get on the border
 
07:43:49.548 --> 07:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
their own businesses and they are hiring
 
07:43:52.610 --> 07:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
our citizens of this country how much
 
07:43:56.150 --> 07:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
money are we losing and
 
07:43:59.110 --> 07:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
it is it is important like
 
07:44:02.570 --> 07:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
another representative I say to instead
 
07:44:05.448 --> 07:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
of and have it a committee doing a
 
07:44:07.368 --> 07:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
commission because I've been speaking to
 
07:44:09.770 --> 07:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
that that our delegation with the
 
07:44:11.890 --> 07:44:11.900 align:start position:0%
Senators and Congressional Delegation
 
07:44:15.110 --> 07:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I've been pointing that up that it
 
07:44:18.288 --> 07:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
is critical for us to know exactly what
 
07:44:20.090 --> 07:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
are we doing what are we doing to help
 
07:44:22.910 --> 07:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
our communities how much are we
 
07:44:25.730 --> 07:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
now seeing how much data the immigrants
 
07:44:29.090 --> 07:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
are contributing to to the economy in
 
07:44:31.788 --> 07:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it is critical it is
 
07:44:34.490 --> 07:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
critical for us to know how much money
 
07:44:37.250 --> 07:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
these people pay in in taxes and where
 
07:44:40.070 --> 07:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
is this money is going when these oh how
 
07:44:41.510 --> 07:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
much money are we losing would these
 
07:44:43.368 --> 07:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
people get the quarter and how much
 
07:44:45.830 --> 07:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
money are we spending to supporting the
 
07:44:47.930 --> 07:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
families when they're staying behind
 
07:44:50.990 --> 07:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why I I'm supporting this
 
07:44:52.910 --> 07:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
07:44:56.930 --> 07:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
we want we want to show our in our
 
07:44:59.330 --> 07:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
delegation you know what exactly is
 
07:45:02.330 --> 07:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire and I how you
 
07:45:04.910 --> 07:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
say you know data getting involved get
 
07:45:08.570 --> 07:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
the offices involved so they can see or
 
07:45:10.070 --> 07:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
they can bring what they have for
 
07:45:12.350 --> 07:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
information maybe that's something that
 
07:45:14.390 --> 07:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know and they have maybe it's
 
07:45:15.770 --> 07:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
something that we can bring it to them
 
07:45:18.110 --> 07:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
and they don't have that information so
 
07:45:20.690 --> 07:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
I I think it is really good to have
 
07:45:20.700 --> 07:45:22.010 align:start position:0%
I I think it is really good to have
these

07:45:22.010 --> 07:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
these
 
07:45:26.448 --> 07:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
commission to study the issues when the
 
07:45:28.430 --> 07:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
bread maker or the or the person who
 
07:45:30.530 --> 07:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
support and the family gets the porter
 
07:45:33.170 --> 07:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
not just like not just because we want
 
07:45:36.288 --> 07:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
to see how much money are we spending to
 
07:45:38.448 --> 07:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
support the the families when they stay
 
07:45:38.458 --> 07:45:39.590 align:start position:0%
support the the families when they stay
behind

07:45:39.590 --> 07:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
behind
 
07:45:43.190 --> 07:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
but it's critical for us as a state to
 
07:45:45.288 --> 07:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
see how much money I will listen with
 
07:45:47.390 --> 07:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
this person get supported especially if
 
07:45:50.448 --> 07:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
it's our business owner and then how
 
07:45:52.010 --> 07:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
many people they've been out of work
 
07:45:54.530 --> 07:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
because those people they you know
 
07:45:56.750 --> 07:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
they've been having dismiss and they've
 
07:45:59.570 --> 07:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
been hiring these people Americans to
 
07:46:00.948 --> 07:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
work in the business of how much money
 
07:46:02.628 --> 07:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
are we losing
 
07:46:05.330 --> 07:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's that's what I
 
07:46:07.670 --> 07:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
have to say and maybe I'm wrong but you
 
07:46:09.708 --> 07:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
know I for me I think it's it is
 
07:46:11.990 --> 07:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
critical for us to do the study and see
 
07:46:14.208 --> 07:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
how much money really is causing to our
 
07:46:14.218 --> 07:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
how much money really is causing to our
taxpayers

07:46:15.590 --> 07:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
07:46:17.690 --> 07:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony I
 
07:46:19.730 --> 07:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
got one question for you
 
07:46:19.740 --> 07:46:20.448 align:start position:0%
got one question for you
um

07:46:20.448 --> 07:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:46:22.730 --> 07:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
taxes are private it's against the law
 
07:46:25.430 --> 07:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
to pull taxes uh for my taxes to be
 
07:46:27.468 --> 07:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
you've looked at and how would the study
 
07:46:30.948 --> 07:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:33.770 --> 07:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
maybe you know we can have members of
 
07:46:35.930 --> 07:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
the community that they've been impacted
 
07:46:39.350 --> 07:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
in in this issue to bring that
 
07:46:41.230 --> 07:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
information you know sometimes people
 
07:46:43.368 --> 07:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
they're they're willing to get that
 
07:46:45.590 --> 07:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
information for this first study
 
07:46:47.570 --> 07:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
committee so I I don't see a problem
 
07:46:51.650 --> 07:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
because I think uh like another state
 
07:46:53.288 --> 07:46:53.298 align:start position:0%
representative he was talking about
 
07:46:55.490 --> 07:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
someone who was
 
07:46:59.930 --> 07:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
um close to be deporter Mr ajala and uh
 
07:47:01.968 --> 07:47:01.978 align:start position:0%
people like him we can bring them to
 
07:47:04.788 --> 07:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
testify and you know I know that he was
 
07:47:06.650 --> 07:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
one of one of the people that he owns a
 
07:47:09.170 --> 07:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
business and he was providing a job to
 
07:47:10.730 --> 07:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
other people and not just that but
 
07:47:13.430 --> 07:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
paying taxes and uh and I know we can
 
07:47:15.708 --> 07:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
get more people like him to bring that
 
07:47:18.170 --> 07:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
information to us so they can help us to
 
07:47:19.670 --> 07:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
study those issues
 
07:47:21.468 --> 07:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:47:24.530 --> 07:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for
 
07:47:29.570 --> 07:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you Mr chair so
 
07:47:32.150 --> 07:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative do you do you think
 
07:47:34.788 --> 07:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
our immigration system is broken
 
07:47:37.430 --> 07:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
it is broken you know it's it's about
 
07:47:39.530 --> 07:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
past time that we do something to fix
 
07:47:43.910 --> 07:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the problem but I think doing this is
 
07:47:46.368 --> 07:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
going to help us to show not just the
 
07:47:48.530 --> 07:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
senator the Congressional Delegation but
 
07:47:52.548 --> 07:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
nationally that we we taken we're taking
 
07:47:55.310 --> 07:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
the first step to show how critical is
 
07:47:58.670 --> 07:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
for us to work on fixing the problem
 
07:48:01.190 --> 07:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's been happening for so long and it's
 
07:48:03.948 --> 07:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
time for us to fix it but we cannot do
 
07:48:06.170 --> 07:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
it as a local so he has to make sure
 
07:48:08.628 --> 07:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
that this commission is bringing like
 
07:48:11.208 --> 07:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
the chair say Brandon that the
 
07:48:13.070 --> 07:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation and this you
 
07:48:15.468 --> 07:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
know everyone who's involved nationally
 
07:48:17.090 --> 07:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they understand
 
07:48:20.628 --> 07:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
exactly how these issues hurting our
 
07:48:23.090 --> 07:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
economy and how these issues can be
 
07:48:26.030 --> 07:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
fixed and we're fixing our broken system
 
07:48:28.610 --> 07:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay you had a follow-up
 
07:48:30.770 --> 07:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:48:32.390 --> 07:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
um with that yes
 
07:48:34.128 --> 07:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
07:48:35.868 --> 07:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
07:48:37.250 --> 07:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for recognizing
 
07:48:39.530 --> 07:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
me Mr chair so I'm I'm still confused
 
07:48:41.390 --> 07:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
though um you know if we're talking
 
07:48:43.250 --> 07:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
about how you know currently we can't
 
07:48:44.990 --> 07:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
find a lot of this publicly promulgated
 
07:48:47.868 --> 07:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
information how how do we expect six
 
07:48:49.548 --> 07:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
legislators to find this information
 
07:48:51.590 --> 07:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
when it's just a legislative study I
 
07:48:53.090 --> 07:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
mean I'm very much confused this is
 
07:48:54.888 --> 07:48:54.898 align:start position:0%
you're talking about tons of federal
 
07:48:56.830 --> 07:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
information tons of State information
 
07:49:00.770 --> 07:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
voluntarily getting information from
 
07:49:02.690 --> 07:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
um from local communities and local
 
07:49:04.548 --> 07:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
organizations and everything I mean this
 
07:49:05.990 --> 07:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a massive undertaking it's
 
07:49:09.288 --> 07:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
logistically huge a lot of data and I'm
 
07:49:13.010 --> 07:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
just unsure how six six legislators who
 
07:49:15.170 --> 07:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
are volunteers and during campaign
 
07:49:17.150 --> 07:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
season by the way that's just a reality
 
07:49:20.030 --> 07:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to serve on this
 
07:49:22.010 --> 07:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
committee constitute a quorum and have
 
07:49:23.510 --> 07:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
the time to find all this I mean this is
 
07:49:25.250 --> 07:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
something that you could give a research
 
07:49:27.650 --> 07:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
Grant to a public university for five
 
07:49:29.388 --> 07:49:29.398 align:start position:0%
years and they would only be you know
 
07:49:30.888 --> 07:49:30.898 align:start position:0%
touching the tip of the iceberg a number
 
07:49:32.810 --> 07:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
of these things so how how do you think
 
07:49:34.670 --> 07:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
these six legislators are going to be
 
07:49:35.750 --> 07:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
able to actually find the information
 
07:49:38.270 --> 07:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
that you you won't expect them to find
 
07:49:40.368 --> 07:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
into would be able to comprise it and
 
07:49:43.968 --> 07:49:43.978 align:start position:0%
compile it in a way for people to digest
 
07:49:46.368 --> 07:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
um to be honest to to answer that
 
07:49:46.378 --> 07:49:47.270 align:start position:0%
um to be honest to to answer that
question

07:49:47.270 --> 07:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:49:50.208 --> 07:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
um I can't I probably ignore it I don't
 
07:49:52.610 --> 07:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
know much maybe I don't know everything
 
07:49:54.170 --> 07:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
that I need to know as a legislator
 
07:49:56.628 --> 07:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
because this is my first turn
 
07:49:59.510 --> 07:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if we we instead of them
 
07:50:01.310 --> 07:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
doing uh the committee we're doing a
 
07:50:04.128 --> 07:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
commission can we have members of the
 
07:50:06.110 --> 07:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
public part of the commission
 
07:50:09.350 --> 07:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
so if we can have members of the public
 
07:50:11.570 --> 07:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
be part of the commission we have so
 
07:50:13.190 --> 07:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
many organizations that already been
 
07:50:16.788 --> 07:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
working with these communities and I'm
 
07:50:18.830 --> 07:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the Latino caucus and
 
07:50:20.810 --> 07:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's a shadow Latino caucus I work with
 
07:50:22.548 --> 07:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of different organizations in our
 
07:50:25.010 --> 07:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
state then they're more than willing and
 
07:50:27.530 --> 07:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
more than the more than happy to help us
 
07:50:30.288 --> 07:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
to to work in getting these information
 
07:50:32.690 --> 07:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
together so I don't think it's going to
 
07:50:34.548 --> 07:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
be an issue for us to gather the
 
07:50:36.410 --> 07:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
information because I know
 
07:50:38.270 --> 07:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
I I have
 
07:50:41.510 --> 07:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
plenty organizations behind us they can
 
07:50:43.670 --> 07:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
help us to gather this information not
 
07:50:47.388 --> 07:50:47.398 align:start position:0%
just the sixth uh members so that of the
 
07:50:50.388 --> 07:50:50.398 align:start position:0%
house can you know do it do the um the
 
07:50:50.398 --> 07:50:52.730 align:start position:0%
house can you know do it do the um the
study

07:50:52.730 --> 07:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
study
 
07:50:55.070 --> 07:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:51:00.430 --> 07:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:02.810 --> 07:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives on this committee
 
07:51:05.388 --> 07:51:05.398 align:start position:0%

07:51:27.830 --> 07:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
freshman okay
 
07:51:32.750 --> 07:51:32.760 align:start position:0%

like everyone else submit it so we know
 
07:51:44.150 --> 07:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we can plan accordingly because it's
 
07:51:46.190 --> 07:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
very disrespectful for the chairman
 
07:51:48.110 --> 07:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm moving along to get his
 
07:51:50.570 --> 07:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
home and then you know somebody's
 
07:51:52.010 --> 07:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
waiting the last second and hiding it
 
07:51:55.250 --> 07:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:57.410 --> 07:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a card for her right
 
07:51:57.420 --> 07:51:58.788 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a card for her right
here

07:51:58.788 --> 07:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:52:02.270 --> 07:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh representative toll
 
07:52:08.690 --> 07:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:10.190 --> 07:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:52:13.368 --> 07:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
um we had huge attendance for this bill
 
07:52:15.350 --> 07:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so I don't want to forget that
 
07:52:18.048 --> 07:52:18.058 align:start position:0%
testimony I want to remind people of
 
07:52:20.330 --> 07:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
what was said here because our citizens
 
07:52:22.850 --> 07:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
took the time to come out here and speak
 
07:52:24.948 --> 07:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
and so I think that information is
 
07:52:26.270 --> 07:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
critical and I'm going to be speaking to
 
07:52:28.548 --> 07:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony so honorable
 
07:52:30.170 --> 07:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
colleagues my name is Amanda Elizabeth
 
07:52:32.570 --> 07:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
toll I represent the city of keen at
 
07:52:35.750 --> 07:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
large I'm speaking in support of hb1284
 
07:52:38.510 --> 07:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
which I am a co-sponsor of this bill
 
07:52:40.190 --> 07:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study the
 
07:52:41.750 --> 07:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
effects of deportation of primary
 
07:52:43.910 --> 07:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
earners of family members who are United
 
07:52:46.910 --> 07:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
States citizens last legislative session
 
07:52:49.430 --> 07:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
we had a very informative and moving
 
07:52:52.490 --> 07:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
hearing for this bill the vast majority
 
07:52:54.410 --> 07:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
of public participation at the hearing
 
07:52:57.350 --> 07:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
was in favor of this bill
 
07:52:59.990 --> 07:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
at that hearing we heard compelling
 
07:53:01.788 --> 07:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
information from representatives from
 
07:53:03.468 --> 07:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
non-profits including the American
 
07:53:05.930 --> 07:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
friends service committee and Catholic
 
07:53:08.510 --> 07:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
Charities along with information from a
 
07:53:10.310 --> 07:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
retired Doctor Who had done extensive
 
07:53:13.010 --> 07:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
work with the Red Cross we also heard
 
07:53:15.650 --> 07:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
from many immigrants themselves about
 
07:53:17.930 --> 07:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
how deportations have harmed their
 
07:53:20.110 --> 07:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
families and their friends
 
07:53:22.670 --> 07:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
collectively they presented information
 
07:53:26.090 --> 07:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
that made clear the devastating economic
 
07:53:29.510 --> 07:53:29.520 align:start position:0%

of primary earners it was especially
 
07:53:34.548 --> 07:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking to hear about how our
 
07:53:38.150 --> 07:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
children our children are being harmed
 
07:53:40.310 --> 07:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
highlighted at this hearing was the
 
07:53:42.350 --> 07:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
psychological pain caused by the
 
07:53:45.590 --> 07:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
absolute Terror families experience when
 
07:53:48.650 --> 07:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
losing a loved one to deportation and
 
07:53:50.708 --> 07:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
the grief they feel in the aftermath
 
07:53:52.910 --> 07:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
additionally it was brought to our
 
07:53:55.010 --> 07:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
attention the devastating toll
 
07:53:57.590 --> 07:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
deportation takes on mental and physical
 
07:54:00.888 --> 07:54:00.898 align:start position:0%

07:54:02.690 --> 07:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
that these impacts on developing
 
07:54:05.930 --> 07:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
children last a lifetime saying we hear
 
07:54:08.270 --> 07:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
this from guidance counselors School
 
07:54:10.388 --> 07:54:10.398 align:start position:0%
nurses and teachers
 
07:54:13.128 --> 07:54:13.138 align:start position:0%
deportation also has a severe economic
 
07:54:15.230 --> 07:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
impact a gentleman who worked for
 
07:54:16.788 --> 07:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities said there are
 
07:54:19.070 --> 07:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 000 undocumented
 
07:54:21.230 --> 07:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants in New Hampshire according to
 
07:54:24.288 --> 07:54:24.298 align:start position:0%
the new American economy study of 2018.
 
07:54:26.750 --> 07:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
he went on to present information about
 
07:54:28.670 --> 07:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
how millions of dollars of buying power
 
07:54:31.070 --> 07:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
this represents and how contrary to
 
07:54:33.110 --> 07:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
popular opinion immigrants contribute to
 
07:54:37.310 --> 07:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
both state and federal taxes moreover we
 
07:54:39.170 --> 07:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
had other speakers who highlighted that
 
07:54:42.288 --> 07:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
after deportations families headed by a
 
07:54:44.090 --> 07:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
single parent suffer from economic
 
07:54:46.548 --> 07:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
insecurity which creates a need for them
 
07:54:48.708 --> 07:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
to require food stamps Section 8 Housing
 
07:54:51.350 --> 07:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
and other critical social services this
 
07:54:53.330 --> 07:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
makes clear that deportation impacts
 
07:54:56.150 --> 07:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in New Hampshire this rebuts
 
07:54:57.830 --> 07:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
the argument that this study shouldn't
 
07:54:59.888 --> 07:54:59.898 align:start position:0%
take place because it's a federal issue
 
07:55:02.150 --> 07:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
deportation directly impacts the
 
07:55:04.910 --> 07:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
pocketbooks of our constituents
 
07:55:06.468 --> 07:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
it's clear
 
07:55:09.110 --> 07:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
that while we have much anecdotal
 
07:55:10.548 --> 07:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
evidence about the impacts of
 
07:55:13.250 --> 07:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
deportation of primary earners but no
 
07:55:15.708 --> 07:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
Statewide data collection we have data
 
07:55:17.690 --> 07:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
elements in very local places like
 
07:55:19.910 --> 07:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
school districts Municipal welfare
 
07:55:22.128 --> 07:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
offices and state Human Service offices
 
07:55:25.310 --> 07:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't been woven together into a
 
07:55:28.010 --> 07:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
state narrative historically some
 
07:55:29.448 --> 07:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
colleagues have implied that a
 
07:55:32.150 --> 07:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
non-profit could compile this we should
 
07:55:34.368 --> 07:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
not shift government responsibility for
 
07:55:36.830 --> 07:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
the well-being of our constituents to
 
07:55:39.468 --> 07:55:39.478 align:start position:0%
non-government organizations the
 
07:55:41.868 --> 07:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
authority of a state or legislative
 
07:55:45.230 --> 07:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
study would hold more weight in both
 
07:55:47.690 --> 07:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
encouraging participation and being
 
07:55:51.708 --> 07:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
respected for policy determination we
 
07:55:54.230 --> 07:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
need this study to collect reputable
 
07:55:57.110 --> 07:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
data on a Statewide level to inform
 
07:55:59.510 --> 07:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
public policy that leads to the best
 
07:56:02.090 --> 07:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
economic and humanitarian outcomes for
 
07:56:04.670 --> 07:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents thank you I will
 
07:56:07.610 --> 07:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
not be taking questions
 
07:56:10.490 --> 07:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony I
 
07:56:12.288 --> 07:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
think I got something to add since I was
 
07:56:14.990 --> 07:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
responsible on the last one there if I
 
07:56:17.030 --> 07:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
made to your testimony there
 
07:56:18.948 --> 07:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
the people that showed up the last time
 
07:56:20.690 --> 07:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
it was quite and I really felt bad for
 
07:56:22.788 --> 07:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
them because all those people that came
 
07:56:24.650 --> 07:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
in here was under false pretenses
 
07:56:26.690 --> 07:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
thinking that a study committee was
 
07:56:29.628 --> 07:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
going to do wonders for them and we I
 
07:56:31.190 --> 07:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
try to explain to them over and over
 
07:56:34.610 --> 07:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
that it was the Federal Government not
 
07:56:37.430 --> 07:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state we have no accountability on
 
07:56:40.250 --> 07:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
immigration and nobody wanted to listen
 
07:56:42.468 --> 07:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
but people out there are giving them
 
07:56:45.708 --> 07:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
poor people false information that they
 
07:56:47.990 --> 07:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
can come here to the state and wear the
 
07:56:51.590 --> 07:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
answers the study committee is I mean I
 
07:56:53.330 --> 07:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
I can't support it I'm just being
 
07:56:55.430 --> 07:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward with you because I would
 
07:56:57.410 --> 07:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
be given false information to people
 
07:57:00.170 --> 07:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
that six legislators will come forward
 
07:57:03.048 --> 07:57:03.058 align:start position:0%
and give the straight scoop and what
 
07:57:04.670 --> 07:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
good does it do when the federal
 
07:57:07.310 --> 07:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
government is the one who is a state
 
07:57:10.730 --> 07:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
federal law in order to fix this uh
 
07:57:14.270 --> 07:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
State U.S legislators senators in
 
07:57:16.368 --> 07:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
congress have to change the law right
 
07:57:19.190 --> 07:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
now we have immigration laws that are
 
07:57:21.530 --> 07:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
not being held accountable for so I
 
07:57:23.030 --> 07:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
since you wouldn't take questions I
 
07:57:26.030 --> 07:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
think I owed it to you the answer on the
 
07:57:27.888 --> 07:57:27.898 align:start position:0%
way I felt with all them people back
 
07:57:30.048 --> 07:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
there and the last time were children I
 
07:57:32.208 --> 07:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
felt so bad for them because they were
 
07:57:33.830 --> 07:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
given promises that we were going to
 
07:57:35.750 --> 07:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
save the world for them and there was
 
07:57:37.490 --> 07:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
not a damn thing that we could do no
 
07:57:38.930 --> 07:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
matter how much money we figure they're
 
07:57:41.388 --> 07:57:41.398 align:start position:0%
spending no matter what all you're going
 
07:57:42.888 --> 07:57:42.898 align:start position:0%
to do is say oh the taxpayers are
 
07:57:45.288 --> 07:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
spending more money on the on them and I
 
07:57:46.968 --> 07:57:46.978 align:start position:0%
felt bad I have him my family's all
 
07:57:49.010 --> 07:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
immigrants came over from Italy so I
 
07:57:50.448 --> 07:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
understand fully
 
07:57:52.610 --> 07:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
but the law is the law so I thought I
 
07:57:53.868 --> 07:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
would throw that out there on my
 
07:57:56.510 --> 07:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
feelings on the last time with that is
 
07:57:58.128 --> 07:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
anyone else going to want to gonna speak
 
07:58:02.708 --> 07:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:05.150 --> 07:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'm going to close the
 
07:58:09.888 --> 07:58:09.898 align:start position:0%
hearing on 1284 and are we on board with
 
07:58:09.898 --> 07:58:11.448 align:start position:0%
hearing on 1284 and are we on board with
um

07:58:11.448 --> 07:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:11.458 --> 07:58:13.070 align:start position:0%
um
yes

07:58:13.070 --> 07:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:58:14.330 --> 07:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:58:14.340 --> 07:58:15.770 align:start position:0%
we are
okay

07:58:15.770 --> 07:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:58:17.510 --> 07:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I actually felt bad for all those
 
07:58:17.520 --> 07:58:24.410 align:start position:0%
I mean I actually felt bad for all those
people

07:58:24.410 --> 07:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
