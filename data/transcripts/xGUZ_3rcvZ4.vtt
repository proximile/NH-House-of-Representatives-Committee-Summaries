as technical corrections to bills as
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
they have passed however in this
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
instance for Senate Bill
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
137 it was a bill that was filed in the
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
first year of of the session and it was
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
a companion piece to another bill the
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
other Bill amended RSA
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
17913 which included uh an increase in a
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
fee uh from $100 to $250 and this was
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
passed and signed into law in the first
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
year of the session Senate Bill 137 was
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
re-referred for in for uh re-referred in
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
the senate in the first year which is
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
our version of retained and they acted
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
on it um at the beginning of this year
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
and sent it to Commerce the specific
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill had ties into the
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
one that was signed into law last year
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
and because the the the other one was a
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
companion piece this one was not amended
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
in the proper sections of increasing
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
that same fee so the fee was still in
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
this bill as it passed this chamber $100
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
reflecting last year's uh initial bill
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
filing so OS drafted an enrolled Bill
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to up the fee to 250 to
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
reflect what is in current law as of
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
right now the uh Clerks of both Chambers
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
met with their respective leadership
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
teams and we felt that because this is a
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
substantive change rather than a
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
technical change that it was best uh to
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
have the house and the Senate vote on it
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
in full to reflect the will of the
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
bodies and that is why this amendment is
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
now are you ready for the question all
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
those in favor say I I those oppose nay
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the RO Bill's
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
adopted we are moving on to the veto
 
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.710 align:start position:0%
adopted we are moving on to the veto
messages

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
now the house will attend to the
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
governor's veto message on House Bill
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
194 FN requiring the director of the
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
compile and maintain a list of public
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
monuments and requiring legislative
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
approval the amendment or permanent
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
markers the question before the house is
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the governor's veto
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
shall House Bill 194 refn become
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
Vil good morning and thank you Mr
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 194 was intended to
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
be a bill that simply put a
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
list of public monuments on the
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
dncr website so that historical
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
monuments can be visited by students
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
from across the country who compete on
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
this activity like Peak bagging is done
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
up in the White Mountains on the 484
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
th000 Footers um so this bill went
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
through our committee but when it went
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate there was an
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that we didn't
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
hear and that's where the problem lies
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
for us we believe that this is a house
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
matter and that the historic markers
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
program is really different than what we
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
were talking about we would like you to
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to weigh on weigh
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
in on this um but we're asking you to
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
vote no please and that is because we
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
want to uphold hold the veto on the bill
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to mention on a more
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
personal level that I was able to sit
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
next to somebody who's an archaeologist
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
who often interfaces with the state of
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the uh Department of
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
cultural natural
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
resources and she has a lot of
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
information about the historic marker
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
program that I would love for her to be
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
able to testify in front of us we could
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
have a robust
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
discussion um and she mentioned a couple
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
of things about the program program that
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
exists right now such as it already has
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
a small budget of its own for reviewing
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
these um matters and it's so it's not a
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
question of money so I believe and I
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
hope that you understand that this
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
robust discussion should take place
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
should the bill be filed again and um we
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
are happy to do that we want you to have
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
a chance and we want the public to have
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
a chance to come before the house thank
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
you vote no
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
vulo thank you Mr
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker since
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
1958 the state of New Hampshire has been
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%

program as of today there are 291 such
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
markers they are new ones being adopted
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
as we
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
speak this bill doesn't change the
 
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
speak this bill doesn't change the
existing

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
process but it adds an additional
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
steps where which involve the which will
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
involve the legis ISL in any decision to
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
or permanently remove
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
ex existing any existing marker I repeat
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
existing markers not new
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
ones this action was brought on by
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
reports of a lack of transparency
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
transparency and public input in
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
situations where the reviews of an
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
existing marker for revision or
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
retirement was
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
requested the original Senate Amendment
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
proposed that an approval of the
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
revision or retirement of a marker be by
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
only that seemed cumbersome so a
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
committee conference was convened to
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
come up with a
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
solution a lot of the discussion of the
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
conference committee determined uh
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
determined the review by the fiscal
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee would be simplest
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
and most effective the governor's veto
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
of hbb 194 focuses solely on the Senate
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 194 which looks
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
to involve the legislature in any
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
decision to amend or permanently remove
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
any existing
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
marker yes there are separations of
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
power but the distribution of power is
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
not not
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
equal all the powers rest with the
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%

Smith thank you Mr
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill does a couple of
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
simple things and by the way we passed
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
it out of here
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
unanimously if a state agency or
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
Department goes before the joint
 
00:26:58.399 --> 00:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
Department goes before the joint
legislative

00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
commit to propose a rule and they say no
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
a few times and the stakeholders
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
involved say no probably more than a few
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
times and then it gets challenged in
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
court and the court says yeah you you
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
can't you can't do this right now that's
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
just the end of it there's no
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
Consequence the governor's veto message
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
complains that we didn't give a fiscal
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
note on what these legal fees were going
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
to be I have a suggestion for the
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch when jail car says no
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
and the stakeholders say no stop it you
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
know how that's going to turn out don't
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
expect that there won't be a consequence
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
now today they can expect there won't be
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
a consequence but there isn't one but
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to give them one it's
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
really simple um he complained that some
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
of the provisions are onerous when rules
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
are proposed they have to notify any
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
known stakeholders and the legislative
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
policy committee that's honorous that
 
00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:58.630 align:start position:0%
policy committee that's honorous that
isn't

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
it's necessary if they're going to get
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
policy right it is necessary for the
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
branches of government to talk to each
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
other I don't blame them it's making
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%

h thank you Mr
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 396 is a relatively short
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
Bill effectively it's one page worth of
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislation what it
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
does is it confines our discrimination
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
statutes and our policy in three
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
critical areas I want to highlight
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
section two and I want to read
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
it in athletic or sporting events or
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
competitions in a sport of similar
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
activity in which physical strength
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
speed or endurance is generally
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
recognized to give an advantage to
 
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.590 align:start position:0%
recognized to give an advantage to
biological

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
males we have sports for
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
kids volleyball basketball
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
soccer in wrestling we we segregate it
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
by weight for a reason we know that
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
physical strength and and body mass
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
actually create a distinct Advantage so
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have weight classes but we don't do
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
that for ER we don't ask the the the
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
athletes to show up on the field and
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
step on a scale to know whether they can
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
wrestling we could segregate our
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
Sports by just creating co-ed and
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
allowing all the kids to play that
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
option exists for all the schools in the
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
state we haven't done that but that is a
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
a way to address the issue before
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
us we could ask that the the school
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
segregate it by by body
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
mass but we don't we segregate it by
 
00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:05.870 align:start position:0%
mass but we don't we segregate it by
biological

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
biological
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
sex and we do that because we do know
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
that there are distinct
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
advantages for biological men relative
 
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
advantages for biological men relative
to

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
women boys versus girls on the
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
field two of my children are over
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
6'4 imagine my junior age High School
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
junior age son decid deciding he wanted
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be on the volleyball team or on the
 
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.470 align:start position:0%
to be on the volleyball team or on the
basketball

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
basketball
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
team in the in the girls
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
room he would have a distinct advantage
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
height-wise over all the other
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
players that disenfranchises our young
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
girls in two major ways and for the
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
record he won't do that but my point
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
is it disenfranchises girls who want to
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
participate in these Sports who want a
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship to a college it also puts
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
them in grave danger of being hurt we've
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
seen this on the
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
field that's the reason we've created
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
girls soccer and boy soccer girls
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
basketball and boys basketball girls
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
volleyball and boys basketb B sorry
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
volleyball there is a reason we're doing
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
this is to protect the participants in
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the sport I would ask that you would
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.349 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
you a very wise grandfather gave me
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
these words about six months ago and
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
I've used them many times here in the
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislature you cannot provide equity
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
for 100% of the people 100% of the time
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
but you do have an obligation to protect
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
the safety of the
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
majority especially in sensitive
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
situations let us fulfill this
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
obligation to the majority thank
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
tour thank you Mr
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker in July Governor cunu vetoed
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 396 and that was the right
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
decision let me start by reading from
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto message I quote
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
in 2018 Republicans and Democrats passed
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to prevent discrimination
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
because as I said at the time it is
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and runs contrary to New
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's livefree or die spirit that
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
still Rings true today the challenge
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 396 is that in some
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
cases it seeks to solve problems that
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
have not presented themselves in New
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in doing so invites
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary Discord
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
well said
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
Governor that 2018 Bill House Bill
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
1319 was entitled simply prohibiting
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on gender identity
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
and it did truly embody the states Live
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
Free or Die Spirit by
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
comparison House Bill 396 not only
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
undermines that Spirit but it does so in
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous and irresponsible
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
way House Bill 396 is an invasion of
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
privacy at its core
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
lacking any definition of the term
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
biological sex or how it would be
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
applied if this bill were to become
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
law somebody could simply look at an
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
individual trying to use a restroom and
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
tell them which bathroom they must use
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
based on their appearance the very
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination other options for
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
determining that person's biological
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
gender would be far more invasive still
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'll let you use your imagination
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
there it's it's also relevant to note
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
that a separate New Hampshire law pass
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
this session stemming from House Bill
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
1205 covers similar ground and currently
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
has our state embroiled in a federal
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that law requires that female
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
athletes and only female athletes must
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
show proof that they of their gender at
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
Birth when signing up for sports it has
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
been challenge for violating not for
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
upholding the provisions of Title 9 so
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
let's not for forc through another law
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
that will only lead to further confusion
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
Discord discrimination and litigation
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
when we have a clear statute preventing
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
these very things on our books Let's
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
vote to uphold the states Live Free or
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
Die Spirit by supporting the governor's
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
veto of this bill and voting no on the
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
override question thank you Mr
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 396 came before the
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee almost two years ago
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I remember it well it was about a
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
three-hour hearing went 7 or 7:30 in the
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
evening and there were two people who
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
testified who really stood out to
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
me one of those was a transgender person
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
who was opposed to the bill
 
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
who was opposed to the bill
who

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
said we may be the people working in the
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
hospital who take care of you when
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
you're sick we may be the people in the
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance who pick you up and take you
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
there some of us are the people who are
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
clearing the road so that you can get to
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
school the message
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
and that struck me because my
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
have and yet that's that's how that bill
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
Framed I think that on many issues both
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
on the left and the right we are being
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
taught to believe that if we differ on
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
policy we must therefore hate each
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
other that is not
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
true it is an easy cell though because
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
power and it benefits people who are
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
pushing for Pure zero sum win
 
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.069 align:start position:0%
pushing for Pure zero sum win
lose

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes it does not benefit those of us
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
who want to settle our differences
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
figure out a way that we can all live
 
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.870 align:start position:0%
figure out a way that we can all live
together

00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes sometimes wiwin situations are
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
very very hard to find sometimes it
 
00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
very very hard to find sometimes it
seems

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
impossible but they're out there if we
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
look for them so there was a second
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
person who testified that stands out in
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
my mind she was a young mother from
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire she told us that she was the
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
victim of sexual
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
assault that she's been in therapy for
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
years that she takes anti-depressants
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that she cries every day in the
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
shower all I want to do she said is to
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
protect my 12-year-old daughter her
 
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.910 align:start position:0%
protect my 12-year-old daughter her
12-year-old

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
12-year-old
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
daughter was a student in the Milford
 
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.390 align:start position:0%
daughter was a student in the Milford
school

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
system a 17-year-old boy in the Milford
 
00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
system a 17-year-old boy in the Milford
school

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
system had taken to using
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms and locker
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
rooms including the girls locker room at
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
times the boy's locker room at
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
times would come in with his
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
friends and would make fun of this
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
12-year-old girl and her friends while
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
changed I don't know how we solv that
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
problem I don't believe that there is a
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all solution to honoring
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
the people
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
who are opposed to the
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
bill and protecting that 12-year-old
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
girl in
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
Milford this bill is the best shot I
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that the world is far more nuanced than
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
CNN or Fox News would have any of us
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
believe and if we allow other people to
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
write our narratives for you if we allow
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
to completely validate one point of view
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
and completely invalidate the other
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
view then we are destined to continue on
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
on we have seen what happens when the US
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
them Paradigm prevails in other
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
countries around the world and
 
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
countries around the world and
throughout

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
history we have not reached Peak
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
intensity yet although I think a lot of
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
people think we have here in the United
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
to I have referred to House Bill 396 on
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
occasion as the can't we all get along
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
Bill I know others don't see it that
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
way but the question is how do we
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
navigate this new normal together in a
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
way that we can all live
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
with one size fits-all Solutions don't
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
work in a lot of cases
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
cases I don't imagine that my speech or
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
any of the other speeches here
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
today are going to change votes on this
 
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.790 align:start position:0%
today are going to change votes on this
veto

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
override but I think
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
our our nation and our world are in a
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
place especially as we approach an
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
upcoming election that has Global
 
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.630 align:start position:0%
upcoming election that has Global
consequences

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to step away
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
from the US them Paradigm from the this
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
or that black and
 
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.670 align:start position:0%
or that black and
white

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
narrative and see each other as human
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
beings so I came up here not really
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
knowing whether this was going to
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
resonate I would ask my colleagues to
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
vote to
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
veto having said that
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
that if you don't override if you don't
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
vote to override The
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
veto vote your
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
conscience and
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
um if anything I've said resonates I ask
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
you that when you leave the chambers
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
today you take it out with you and back
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
you the state constitution requires a
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
roll call a two3 vote is required to
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
override a veto this will be a roll call
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
this is a roll all vote chair recognized
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative Divine for a
 
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:39.829 align:start position:0%

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that at its
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
core House Bill 396 sends the message
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
you are a freak what are you doing here
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
in a bathroom locker room or on a sports
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
team no matter how it support is dress
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
it up and and if I know the Milford
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
incident should have been a school
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issue or a crime that the
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
police should
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
handle then would I press the red button
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of sustaining the governor
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
Governor's veto of a misguided attempt
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
at regulation cutting through
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
decisiveness rhetoric masquerading as
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
concern for women's safety and just once
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I know you can recognize a
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
bad Bill I hope you'll vote with
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry sen calt is waved

last March this body voted to pass HB

1093 the bill prohibiting school boards
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
from mandating maske wearing the body on

same soon
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
thereafter since that time there has
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
been some relevant new evidence that has
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
emerged to further support this bill on
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
May 31st the testimony that Anthony
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
fouchy had months ear earlier given to a
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
congressional subcommittee was finally
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
released when fouchi was asked by a
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
member of this committee if he had
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
followed any of the numerous scientific
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
studies concerning learning loss and
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
other negative effects on children
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
wearing masks fouchi
 
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.870 align:start position:0%
wearing masks fouchi
said

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
no he then
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
admitted there are a lot of conflicting
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
studies there are those that say yes
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
there is an impact and there are those
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
that say there's not I still think
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
air the doctor was further asked if
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
there was ever a cost-benefit analysis
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
done on the unintended consequences of
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
masking Kids versus the protection that
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
it would give them he answered not to my
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge during his testimony he also
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
admitted that the 6ot social dist
 
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
distancing sort of just appeared and was
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
not based on any scientific studies from
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
his other statements it seems likely
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
that mask mandates emerged in a similar
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
way his testimony asserts that there is
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
indeed a strong Reasonable Doubt
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the effectiveness of masks and
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
a growing concern for their possible
 
00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:23.470 align:start position:0%
a growing concern for their possible
harmful

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
effects this shocking rev these shocking
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
Revelations seemed to have been
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
overlooked as HB 1093 was nevertheless
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
vetoed Dr fouchi the Doctor Who headed
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
one of the organization's recommending
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
masks had not even been following the
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
research being done on their effects on
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
children and then admitted that there is
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
no certainty that mask wearing did not
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
negatively impact
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
students during the co
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic we continuously heard the
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
phrase follow the
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
science the science as reflected in the
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
many conflicting studies that have
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
emerged does not provide clear
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
justification for mask mandates no one
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
especially a child should be forced to
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
do something that could possibly cause
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
him or her physical and even emotional
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
harm unless face mask are proven beyond
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
a shadow of a doubt to be harmless they
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
should not ever be mandated by school
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
boards in his veto message the governor
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
cited the importance of local control a
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
concept that usually makes sense in our
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
state school districts but this concept
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
of local control does not give School
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
boards the authority to make Health
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
decisions for students in in fact to do
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
so is unethical a recent article in The
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
Archives of disease and childhood
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
concluded that recommended child masking
 
00:52:04.839 --> 00:52:05.710 align:start position:0%
concluded that recommended child masking
is

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
unsupported by current scientific data
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and inconsistent with accepted ethical
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
Norms decisions regarding the use of any
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
medical intervention should rightfully
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
be left to
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
parents to protect children from the
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
potential harm of maske wearing and to
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that the most fundament
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
fundamental unit of local control as the
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
family the governor's veto should be
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
overridden thank you Mr
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 1093 would prohibit mandatory
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
mask policies in schools it would
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
eliminate the ability of local school
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
districts to put in place practices
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
procedures and policies to protect
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
students and staff in the event of any
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
health emergency regardless of guidance
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
provided by state or local Health
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
officials no one can predict what will
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
happen in the future best practices in
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
health disease and prevention continue
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
to evolve
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
based upon scientific
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
advances as the governor has noted we
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to ensure the
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
state minimizes its infringement on
 
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.750 align:start position:0%
state minimizes its infringement on
local

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
control our local elected school boards
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
should have the freedom to respond to
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
health emergencies according to the
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
individual needs of their Community to
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
best protect their children I urge you
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
to vote no no to suain the governor's
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%

Noble thank you Mr
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise today in support of
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
overriding the veto of HB
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
1093 The veto message states that just
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
because we don't like a local decision
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we should remove their
 
00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:27.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we should remove their
Authority

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
however in February of
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
22 the governor did remove local
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
Authority for mask
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
mandates as the public health guidance
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
had changed school districts were told
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they would be in violation of the
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
rules if they did not end their mask
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
mandates that's not local
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
control the state believed at least in
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
that moment that state public Public
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
Health experts were more qualified to
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
make the decision about mask
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
policies instead of threatening the
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
school districts with rules violations
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
well over a year into their
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
policies the state should have taken
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
those rules into account from the very
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
beginning to protect New Hampshire
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
students and to promote a partnership
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
between local districts and Families
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not what
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
happened in fact parents concerns with
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
masks causing barriers to learning were
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
ignored concerns with masks causing
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
children to have behavioral and mental
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
health issues were
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
ignored parents just wanting their
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%

learning the truth is that fear won

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
covid and students and science
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
lost while school boards dealt with
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
significant blowback for their mask
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
mandates that must be
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
corrected decisions about mask mandates
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
are best left to experts at the state
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
level where emotions can be tempered
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
with scientific facts and a proper risk
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis can be
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
done this is not a big government
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
approach like the veto message says
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
this is government taking responsibility
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
for public health and not forcing the
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
decision making onto local school boards
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
that are not equipped to make those
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
decisions I'd be willing to bet that
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
many school boards never want to be
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
faced with that responsibility
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
again The veto message states that big
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
government is never the solution and
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
neither is a one siiz fits-all
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
approach but the state takes this exact
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
approach with another medical
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
intervention required to attend
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
school the vaccine
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
schedule should we allow school boards
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
to create vaccine
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
policy would it be acceptable for
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester to say thank you for
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
providing guidance but we will only
 
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:53.039 align:start position:0%
require these two vaccines to attend
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
school or for Hollis to say we we aren't
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to require any vaccines at all
 
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
going to require any vaccines at all
local

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
we will mandate masks every flu season
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
and another that leaves it to parent
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
choice the problem is none of that
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
promotes fair and Equitable access to
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
education as stated in the veto message
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
one of the state's foremost
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is to know the limits
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
of of its power I
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
agree but it is also our responsibility
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
to protect the individual from being
 
00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:39.799 align:start position:0%
infringed upon by any level of
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%

support in both the house and the other
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%

on a Voice vote on the consent calendar

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
337e titled lease agreements of

equipment pertaining to lease purchase
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
agreements with a non-appropriation
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
clause also called an escape Clause so
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
that equipment leased under this RSA do
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
not contain permanently installed
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
equipment nor facility improvements or
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
building Renovations that become
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
fixtures understand the legislative
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this RS A is for equipment
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
such as a vehicle like a fire Tru
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance or police cruiser or portable
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
equipment such as a back ho a chipper or
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
a copy machine these items are not
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
deeply installed and they do not become
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
fixtures and importantly if the Escape
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
Clause is invoked to end the lease all
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
of these items are easily
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
returned Mr Speaker this bill is needed
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
because political subdivisions across
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
the state are misusing lease purchase
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
agreements with Escape Clauses for
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
equipment under RSA
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
337e in order to fund significant
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
facility improvements and building
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
Renovations around deeply installed
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
equipment such as boilers windows and
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
led Li them light ing that all become
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
fixtures in one case a
 
01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:03.150 align:start position:0%
fixtures in one case a
20year

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
20year
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
25.2 million lease with an escape Clause
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
is being used for quote overdue repairs
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
in maintenance to facilities end quote
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this lease is costing
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers an estimated $6.5 million more
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
than if a bond was used since interest
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
rates for lease purchase agreements with
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
Escape Clauses are always significantly
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
higher than for bonds due to the
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility to escape the lease
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
additionally escape from this type of a
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
lease for items that become fixtures is
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
not economically feasible the act of
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
uninstalling removing replacing and
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
reinstalling Capital items is both
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
impractical and cost
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
prohibitive furthermore it goes without
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
saying that a least building renovation

or addition cannot be realistically
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
returned therefore the city town or
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
school district is essentially locked
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
into the lease and taxpayers pay for the
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility of an escape Clause that
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
they cannot use finally The veto message
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
clearly reveals s that this bill as well
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
as current rsas are unfortunately
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstood specifically the claims
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
that this bill would effectively
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of Municipal leases to
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
acquire fixtures and that leases must be
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
secured more frequently than bonding
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
opportunities permit are both faulty and
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
incorrect let me be very clear House
 
01:06:52.799 --> 01:06:53.829 align:start position:0%
incorrect let me be very clear House
Bill

01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
1187 absolutely
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit lease agreements
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
instead it Narrows the scope of lease
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements covered by RSA
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
337e and it also clarifies importantly
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
equipment importantly both leases under
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
both leases under RSA 32 as well as
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
energy performance Contracting which
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
falls under
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
22i which the these types of leases
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
guarantee that savings produced by an
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
energy product project will be
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient to finance the full cost of
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
the project these are both still
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
supported and are unaffected under this
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill despite last minute erroneous
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
claims by some
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
lobbyists notably both leases and bonds
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
have the same timeline and equal number
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
of annual
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities as both are proposed osed
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
as part of the annual budget and annual
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
meeting process to conclude House Bill
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
1187 is a common sense bill that adjusts
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
the scope of lease purchase agreements
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
with an escape Clause this bill ensures
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
that leases under RSA 37
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
337e do not contain permanently
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
installed equipment that become fixtures
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
nor building Renovations which makes the
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
lease both impractical to escape and
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily expensive to
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers importantly under this bill
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
lease purchase agreements and energy
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
performance Contracting do remain
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
funding options for all political
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions under RSA 32 and 21i at a
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
lower cost to taxpayers which was
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
Association in the Senate hearings
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
lastly Mr Mr Speaker by overriding The
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
veto we are putting the needs of every
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
Granite stator who is overpaying in
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
property taxes for these types of leases
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
ahead of the wants of lobbyists this
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill is a positive and needed statutory
 
01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
update for our constituents while
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
ensuring that Leasing and energy
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
companies can make a fair but not
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
excessive profit for these reason
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge my fellow colleagues to
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
uphold the position of the house to
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 1187 becoming law and
 
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the Humane

Society and other animal welfare
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
organizations supported this bill
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and still support this bill and if I
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
know that my constituent the governor
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
claimed that the reason that he vetoed
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was that it said anyone that
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
was in a nationally accredited Cairo
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
program chiropractor
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
program um instead of saying vet or
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
chiropractor but only vets and
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are admitted into
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
nationally accredited Chiropractic
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
programs and if I know that a human
 
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
being being and not even a child needs a
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
referral to see a chiropractor so why
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
would an
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
animal and if I know that especially
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
farm animals that carry heavy loads like
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
draft horses sustain injuries that
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
chiropractor service would be coste
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
efficient and quick to help relieve but
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
that getting a referral from a vet first
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
could be cost prohibitive in relieving
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
that animal's pain and if finally that I
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
know that this bill was unanimously
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%

been asked to to remind you that I I had
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
a career working at Dees and spent many
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
hours in the field working on water
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
quality issues and clean water is
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
extremely important to me as it is to
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
I and I'm working hard in the new fin
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
Lake Area also for similar issues of
 
01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.229 align:start position:0%
Lake Area also for similar issues of
nutrient

01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
nutrient
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
introduction from The Watershed into the
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
lake and how we're going to manage that
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
through best management
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
practices on the land use level this
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill though well-meaning does put the
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse it
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
ignores the state's Dees cyanobacteria
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
plan and its suggestion for the use of
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
the best management practices are the
 
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.629 align:start position:0%
the best management practices are the
current

01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
law for managing golf courses and sod
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
farms in the Department of Agriculture
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
so phospherous and nitren are the two
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
blooms and drive cyanobacteria blooms as
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
well however turf fertilizer now
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
contains little Turf in the as as
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
defined in the law basically we're
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
talking about grass turf fertilizer
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
contains little or no phosphorus anymore
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
and is no longer likely a major
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
contributor of phosphorus to some
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
watersheds uh uh unlike what you may
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
hear according to Dees and the state
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria plan the first thing that
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
we should do to address
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
nutrients going to cyanobacteria blooms
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
is to identify the source es of
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in the
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
Watershed each Watershed specifically
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
different common sources of these
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
nutrients phosphorous in particular are
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater agricultural runoff septic
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
rain water foul organic matter the
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
leaves in your yard weathering of rocks
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
and historic sediments that are already
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of lakes that have been
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
there for decades so cyanobacteria is
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
natural and after all its growth is
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced by the introduction of these
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
nutrients but they can come from many
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
sources so a recent study from the
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
University of
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
Minnesota found that up to 60% of damage
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
to Urban
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes is caused by excess
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
nutrients that are produced by Leaf
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
litter or the leaves that are that are
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
in your yard if they're improperly
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
cleaned up or if they're not disposed of
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
properly they will break down and they
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
can contribute Foster to the
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
environment that's where you get up
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's where you have a brown River like
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
the Smith River and damur it's a brown
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
River that's from Leaf debris and
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
down in de's testimony to the
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
committee they state in their letter
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me for for reading this
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide the industry has removed
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
Foster from most bags of fertilizers
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
sold at retail
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
Market forces have largely taken care of
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
this issue at the retail
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
level in their testimony Dees also
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns on the enforcement of
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
this bill because it has two portions
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
one that regulates both the
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
landowner and the small
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
businessman and then it also dictates
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
what can be sold at retail furthermore
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
Dees and its cyano bacteria plan has as
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
a second priority not the first priority
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
the second priority in the C bacteria
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
plan from Dees is the development of
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
local overlay plans to manage nutrients
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
translate that to your local land
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
use setting plans of its own for a
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
shed so according to Dees and this makes
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh perfect sense to me for my my uh
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
background working in the
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
field it's not possible if you take a
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
sample on the lake and Foster is
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
X you don't know where that Foster came
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
from you cannot say it came from
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
fertilizer or you can't say it came from
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
Leaf waste there's no way to identify at
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
the lake level where did phosphorus come
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
from and this little uh actual sampling
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
to show specific sources one of the
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
water bodies that was a driver of this
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislation Arlington Reservoir
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
there is no data little data the dees
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
has excuse me for identifying where the
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
phosphorus has come from that affects
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
there therefore regulating phosphorus at
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
the turf level is not going to guarantee
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that you're going to prevent
 
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.709 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that you're going to prevent
cyanobacteria

01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
blooms the use of best management plans
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted to each Watershed
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
is the better solution through education
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
as the is the tail end of the bill talks
 
01:23:02.679 --> 01:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
as the is the tail end of the bill talks
about

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
education this week one of our my fellow
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives received a letter from a
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
lawn fertilization company that states
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
they would have a significant impact on
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
their work and they also state that they
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
have not been using fertilizer that
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
contains phosphorus since
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
2013 and most of what they do most of
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
the work they do is with nitrogen
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
for an annual fertilization of your lawn
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
Foster generally is only used for new
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
Lawns or for
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
lawn so to summarize that if that made
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
reducing phosphorus through controlling
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizer at the home
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
level has an
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
unknown and very likely minimal impact
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
on the phosphorus that ends up in your
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
ponds Dees
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
recommends that in three places the in
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
their fosterers fact sheet in their
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
and in the state's cyanobacteria plan
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
the dees
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
recommends using best management plans
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you protect your water
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
bodies from the in influx of nutrients
 
01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.750 align:start position:0%
bodies from the in influx of nutrients
excuse

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
me having spoken
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
with the assistant commissioner Dees the
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture the lead de
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
person for
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and with a person in
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture who manages pesticides and
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizers this week There's complete
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
agreement among
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
them that all of the regulatory
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill are
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and if you were to have
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
read it closely you would notice that
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
that's the case they are only they're
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
only enforceable after the fact did you
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
apply too much fertilizer and the
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner says no but the neighbor says
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
oh I know he did and then the inspector
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
comes and says
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
this was two weeks ago there's nothing I
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
can do so there's a number of things in
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
this bill that are unenforceable in that
 
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:35.310 align:start position:0%
this bill that are unenforceable in that
way

01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
so I thought I'd add a little piece on
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
this at the very end this is not if you
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a vote against the
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
environment if you're concerned about
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
the perception of how you might vote on
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
this this is truly a vote for the
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
environment because in the long run
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
money will be more wisely spent on
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
controlling these
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
nutrients as they head towards your
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
surface water in best management
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
practices and by local
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
communities understanding exactly what
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
their Watershed is composed of do you
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
have a cold deep lake with a few
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
Cottages around it do you have a shallow
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
warm lake with three or four layers of
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
of cottages around it which is a
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
completely different thing I have gone
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
over what I was supposed to say and I'm
 
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
sure I'm over my 3 minute limit so I
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
enourage you to vote red and to uphold
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto thank you chair
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
bordis thank you Mr Speaker I am
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually a co-sponsor of this bill and I
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
am asking everybody in the house to
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
sustain the governor's veto house bill
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
1293 will make it against the law for an
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
individual to apply any fertilizer on
 
01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.550 align:start position:0%
individual to apply any fertilizer on
their

01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
lawn during or before a predicted
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
rainfall when the ground is Frozen when
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
the grass is actively growing within 25
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
ft of a storm drain or deposited where
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
could enter a storm
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
drain um within 25 ft of river Rivers
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
streams Creeks Brooks reservoirs ponds
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
lakes and so forth despite these
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
extremely restrict restrictive rules for
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
The Lawns uh of
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
individuals sad farms and golf courses
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
are exempt from this so for example the
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh Laconia Country Club which is right
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
on porus Bay or a block away from porus
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
Bay would not have these restrictions
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
enforced on it I live right on porus Bay
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
on Lake wiip pasak we have a major cob
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria issue there but this bill will
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
not help this is a toothless bill it
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
will not be enforced um the only time
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
this will be enforced is if a neighbor
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
complains Joe next door he over
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizes his lawn it's toothless there
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
is no way to enforce this bill the
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture would only
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
cons uh conduct inspections based on a
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
complaint so if nobody complains how do
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
we enforce this bill there are no
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
penalties for the violation of this
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
law if there's no penalties what is the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
use of having a
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
law if the veto is overturned an
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
individual in the state who is simply
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get grass to grow on their
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
yard will likely be in some shape or
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
form in violation of this bill um as far
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
again there's really no enforcement
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism but I don't want to be in
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
violation of anything I don't use
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizer but many people do this bill
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
would sail through in a state like
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we are not Massachusetts
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
we are the live free a die State as the
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
governor stated in his veto me message
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
if the intent of this legis of the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislature was to reduce the impact of
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
these fertilizers in New Hampshire water
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
bodies that I encourage future
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to be more targeted towards
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
Lakes streams and other environmentally
 
01:29:15.199 --> 01:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
Lakes streams and other environmentally
sensitive

01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
areas as well as include practic
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
practical mechanisms for enforcement
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
again if this bill can't be enforced
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
there's no use in it I urge everybody
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
here to sustain the governor's veto on
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you you recognize
 
01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:39.229 align:start position:0%

overriding the governor's veto for HB
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
1293 this bill was closely considered in
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee and in fact the letter
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier by my colleague uh
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
was in due consideration and the bill
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
was substantially amended with close
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
cooperation with Dees Department of
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and the Farm Bureau based on
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
the input from that
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
letter upon further review the committee
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%

cleanup no amount of these forever

chemicals is
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable as elected officials we have
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
a duty to protect our clean
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
water past contamination is a proven
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
threat and we must ensure those
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for pollution not the
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers bear the cost of cleanup with
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
32 years in the district I've seen the

enough I've been on the resources

committee and the Commerce Committee so
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen both sides of these bills the
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory side and the cleanup side I
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
also serve on the long-term Drinking

Water Commission and those colleagues
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
agree also that this is a sensible
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
override it's not a partisan issue it's

thing it's about protecting our families
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
from this long-term health risk the
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
resources committee passed this on a
 
01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
Voice vote or passed it 20 to nothing
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the house passed it on consent on a
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
Voice vote so now it's time we get
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
together override the governor's veto
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%

Lon thank you Mr Speaker friends we
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
sadly find ourselves near the end of our
 
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
time together I appreciate the
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
relationships we built the good laws we
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
have passed in the process we have the
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity now to do one more good
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing we can rescue a good bill House
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 1581 would allow cultivate allow
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers to operate
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
additional cultivation centers including
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
green houses it had a thorough
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
discussion in health and human services
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it passed on the consent calendar
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed this bill stating
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I quote the legislation provides
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
scant detail regarding safety security
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
and location requirements these details
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
are necessary to ensure appropriate
 
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:13.239 align:start position:0%
controls on a regulated substance so the
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
good news is that's all already in
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rules current law allows
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
multiple dispensing locations and this
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
bill Echoes the same language to enable
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
multiple cultivation locations both
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
refer to the rule making authorization
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's already there but there is one
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
other section for the dispensing
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
locations so I made sure that that
 
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
didn't matter I went through all 65
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
pages of administrative rules dealing
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
with safety security and location not
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
once did it site that extra little bit
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
for the extra dispensing locations so
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we don't need anything
 
01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
more than what was ped it was a
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
beautifully written elegant bill that
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
added only the language we needed we
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
already have safety security and
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
location and this requires the
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
municipality and the department to meet
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and make sure they
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
listen to the concerns on location so
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate the fact that the
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
governor is very concerned to make sure
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
that we're doing it right we already are

reflection and thank everyone who has uh

who was my predecessor in marac 27 then

30 poster districting uh Mary Stewart
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
gues implored us as a body she said we
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
really need to find a way to compensate
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
legislators and we really need to make
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we are representative of a
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
cross-section of the state and I want to
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
say that we've done some work to to get
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
closer to that but there is more work to
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
do so to reiterate that she believed in
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
that I believe in that and it's
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
something that we're working on as a as
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
a team together we have fortunately
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
upgraded some some of our technology all
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
of you were able to sign in not today
 
02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
but when we actually get paid mileage
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
you were able to sign in and press some
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
buttons and track your mileage we are so
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
much closer to getting a perdum while
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
you get your mileage you could get a pum
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
if we vote that through next year just a
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
thought um in terms of my journey as a
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislator uh the first year that I was
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
elected 2019 I was able to work across
 
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
the aisle with some Republican
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues to update our building code
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm really proud of that work we
 
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
also put through a child care business
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
study with some cross uh bipartisan work
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
and that child care business study later
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
turned into the special committee on
 
02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
child care so we are building to address
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest issues in our state
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to child care as a mom of
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
three one of whom is in preschool right
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
now Child Care is a huge issue and I
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
implore you to continue the work for
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
child care um next year it's really
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
important we've also been bonded
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
together uh we went through covid
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
together we did a road show legislature
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%

02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
Athletic Field a sports complex the UNH
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
parking lot in our cars uh and we also
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
modernized during that time I will tell
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
you that I was nursing as a nursing mom
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
and I was able to pump in some of those
 
02:02:38.109 --> 02:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
locations and when we came back here as
 
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
a legislature we actually had a mamava
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the basement of the loob so I could
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
keep pumping so congratulations and Well
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
Done team well done we are
 
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:51.120 align:start position:0%

again we did the special committee on
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
child care and that's awesome I think we
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
need to keep pushing for that we also
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
did a special committee on housing with
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
some big wins this year so Pat
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%

our parking reform for multif family I
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
think that will make a big difference
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
for developments and for those of you
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%

02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
development in existing Lots uh we can
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
now re-evaluate parking and there's real
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for housing um I recently
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
