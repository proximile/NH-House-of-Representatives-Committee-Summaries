here thank you Mr chairman and good
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee for the
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Michael Bose I
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham District 5 the town
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
of eeping and I'm here this morning
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
to encourage the adoption of House Bill
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
1013 in my judgment the defin current
 
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
definition in statute of temporary
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
alimony is seriously flawed and needs a
 
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.909 align:start position:0%
alimony is seriously flawed and needs a
major

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment I believe
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
definition this 23% formula for C
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
calculating temporary
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
alimony as currently written doesn't
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
take into consideration the marital
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
obligation of both parties and their
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
relative abilities to
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
pay under these current rules for
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
calculating temporary alimony a lower
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
earning spouse may be put at a
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
significant disadvantage if the higher
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
earning spouse abdicates
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
his or her responsibility for marital
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
assets such as a house or other
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
family someone who will testify later on
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
in this hearing will give you some
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
concrete examples of the damage that's
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
done by this inadequate formula for
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
if you're the victim of an inappropriate
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
application of this
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
formula fighting that decision can
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
require the services of a lawyer and
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
take time and money in a time of divorce
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
which is an
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
people now I believe that the committee
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
can improve this bill
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
and in my written testimony I've
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
provided some
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
written a written example of what an
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and I know I can't propose an
 
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
amendment and I know I can't propose an
amendment

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
myself but if an amendment were to be
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
proposed the language in my written
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
testimony might be appropriate
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
language it might be appropriate for
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to craft such an amendment
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
should someone agree and present it when
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
we EXA the bill on the 5th of March
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
March exactly exactly and what would
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
this suggested language do it would
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
essentially change the formula to a 5050
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
formula instead of the 23% formula that
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.550 align:start position:0%
formula instead of the 23% formula that
exists

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
today now if you were going to submit an
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment to this
 
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill since this particular language that
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
I've suggested in my written testimony
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
only modifies the definition the term
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony you may also want to
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
look at other parts of RSA 458
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
colon9 to see if there are further
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments to language that might be
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
needed so in conclusion I urge the
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee to address this serious
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
concern to prevent future occurrences of
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
in the words of one of my constituents
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
quote a lower earning spouse is
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
effectively abandoned often with
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
children and with limited financial
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
resources and she must choose between
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
putting groceries on the table and
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
hiring a lawyer for a long and drawn out
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
fight and I thank you Mr chair for the
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify to be happy to
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if I can
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh representative Vose uh
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
specific to your uh proposed amendment
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
or the narrative to improve the bill
 
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
what's the definition of reasonable
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
guidance reasonable need I believe would
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
be a need that is fair and just to both
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
parties followup Mr chairman follow
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
up and relative to fair and Justice
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
would that be a judge's decision then
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
and not an argument of not an argument
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
but an advocacy of both parties
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
justifying what the what their
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be yes
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative Bose
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
Vos seeing none thank you and thank you
 
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.710 align:start position:0%
Vos seeing none thank you and thank you
Mr

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
chairman chair recognizes Patricia
 
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:38.949 align:start position:0%
chairman chair recognizes Patricia
Davidson

00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
the first requirement for giving
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
testimony here is turn the mic
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
on and I say that politely because the
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
last time I went to testify somewhere
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
they had to remind me so thank you thank
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh my name is Patricia
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
Davidson I live in eping New Hampshire
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh I went through a divorce between de
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
December of 2019 and it was finalized in
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
November of
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
2022 um has anybody here been through a
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
contentious all right so there's no
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
personal experience the one giving
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
testimony does not customarily ask
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
committee rhetorical then
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm very interested in this
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
particular bill because my experience
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
with it was very unequitable
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh there is no particular language in uh
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
our SAA 458 uh that describes how
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony should be calculated
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
so in most cases the judge will use the
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
calculation for uh term alimony which is
 
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.509 align:start position:0%
calculation for uh term alimony which is
the

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
23% however during the divorce process
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
spouses should be on equal Financial
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
footing no one should be given an
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
advantage over another given that the
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
parties are still married temporary
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
alimony must take into consider
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
consideration the marital obligations of
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
the parties and their relative abilities
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
to pay suggesting that the 23% formula
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
for term alimony orders be used for
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
calculating temper alimony is
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
unjust keep in mind that unlike for term
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
alimony orders during the divorce
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings an honorable party does not
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
have access to assets
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the ruling for temporary alimony
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
appealed the 23% formula is the lower
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
earning spouse that a significant
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantage if the higher earning
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
spouse is
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous it would be much more
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate that the marital obligations
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
be paid proportionally to income or that
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
the alimony be 50% of the difference in
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
gross income as described in RSA 5
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
45819 a part two the phrasing of the new
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
text says that the court can find
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise however that requires that the
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
lower earning spouse hire a lawyer and
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
have the time energy and financial
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
resources to prove that 23% is
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that gives the higher
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
earning spouse a significant Advantage
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
they are also given the opportunity to
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
leverage or Force the lower earning
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
spouse into an inequitable AR
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
Arrangement because the lower earning
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
spouse cannot afford to pay the bills
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
let alone hire a lawyer in my case the
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
judge applied the 23% difference in
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
income formula for term alimony that
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
calculation gave me a temporary alimony
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
amount of $
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
2,33 a month no consideration was given
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the fact that my spouse moved away
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
and left me with sole responsibility for
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
all the household bills after paying the
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
mortgage and the property taxes I had
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
$173 a month left that needed to cover
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
utilities care for two special needs
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
pets food food gas
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
Etc I could not appeal that ruling based
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
on the financial affidavits that were
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
filed with the court this Arrangement
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
allowed my spouse to save $2,000 a month
 
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
in an account from which he had removed
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
my name in addition to that $2,000 a
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
month he also had multiple voluntary
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
deductions from his pay including
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
significant contributions to our
 
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.910 align:start position:0%
significant contributions to our
retirement

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
account luckily I had a side business I
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
closed that business and found a
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
part-time job so that I could leverage
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
those assets to pay the bills both
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
household and legal if I didn't have
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
that business to to liquidate and
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
leverage I would not have been able to
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer and I would have to have
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
accepted my spouse's final decree
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
proposal because of the financial
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
restraining order you are under during a
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding I could not access my
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
retirement accounts I could not take out
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
a home equity loan or a personal loan to
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
bridge me until the divorce was
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
Final while my spouse was scking away
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
money and living his new life I drained
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
the assets I did have access to
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
out was 34 months from when my husband
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
left me to our divorce was Final and I
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
finally did have to settle that long dur
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
duration is a direct result of my spouse
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
Pro not providing Discovery documents
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the multiple motions I had to file
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
with him to comply and during that that
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
time he was spending marital funds in
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
direct violation of the financial
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
restrain order it seemed to be an
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
intentional tactic to drain me
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
financially if he had borne an equitable
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
financial burden I expect that that
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
would not have been the case do not
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
think that my situation is
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
unique I hear the stories mostly from
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
women in my divorce care and my runaway
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
husbands support groups the lower
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
earning spouse is effectively abandoned
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
often with children with limited
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
financial resources and she has to
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
choose between putting groceries on the
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
table and hiring a lawyer for a long
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
drawn out
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
fight guess what she usually
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
chooses I was one of the lucky ones I'm
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
here today and I had a business to
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
liquidate again temporary alimony orders
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
must take into consider consideration
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
the marital obligations of the parties
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
and they must put the spouses on an even
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
Financial footing during the course of
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
the divorce anything else is inequitable
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and unjust will you take questions yes
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
because an amendment cannot be brought
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
before a
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
hearing uh but winking and nudging can
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
be should per chance an amendment come
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
to us that might include the words or a
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
formula based on 50% of the difference
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
between the party's gross incomes at the
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
time the order is
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
created would that be the kind of change
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
you might wish that is the kind of
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
change that I would like to see happen
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
yes well we just might get an amendment
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
that says that who knows thank you any
 
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.870 align:start position:0%
that says that who knows thank you any
other

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and I was going to say we're
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
calling up an old friend but I don't use
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
the word old so what is the term we use
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
here put your mic on for that for the
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
record uh Mr chairman I offer an
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
alternative strategy yes and ask that
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
you use aggressively mature we are
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
bringing an aggressively mature veteran
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
to this committee one whom we've enjoyed
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay I was distressed to hear the
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
this woman I'm very sorry for her plight
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
um but let me first address the bill as
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
proposed and why it's proposed the way
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
it is and I can understand the
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
objections to it but I think part of the
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
objections to it come from perhaps an
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
incomplete knowledge of what the law
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
allows and that's certainly important
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
first the I was involved in the original
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
alimony reform initiatives and had
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
competing bills back around 217 when the
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire decided that it
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
needed to when the the child and family
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
law committee initially decided to uh
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
Overlook overhaul the alimony statute
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
because it needed work at the risk of
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
being somewhat Ser self-serving the term
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
the concept of term alimony was actually
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
mine it was adopted by the uh by the
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
court I had by the committee I had no
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
objection to it the original basis of
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
that term came out of the Massachusetts
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
alimony Reform Act which before and they
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
used the term general term alimony so
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
what I did was I abbreviated and created
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
the term term alimony like I said it was
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
later adopted the point here about using
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
the the current alimony formula uh
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
brings it in Conformity with the rest of
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
the statute okay uh the idea is is
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry if this is here the idea
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
behind the original alimony statute
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
reform was that it would bring predi
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
ability to an alimony order and you
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be going into a court with a
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
wild west shoot him
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
out the reason why it's 23% was actually
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
the result of two prior mistakes in the
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
law that was actually adopted uh the
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
original alimony statute prior to reform
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
had a provision in it which allowed a
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
court to take into consideration the tax
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
considerations of uh of an alimony order
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
because at that point point in time
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
alimony was both taxable as income to
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
the uh to the recipient and tax
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
deductible is an above the line
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the payer uh so that was
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
an important tax consideration it was
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
omitted from the Reform Bill that they
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh ordered that ultimately became law
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the subsequent tax cuts and job
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
whatever Act was federally of
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
2017 eliminated the deductibility as
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
Alamo so the statute had a big hole in
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
it and the big hole was if it's going to
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
be 30% of somebody's income without
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
consideration which is what it was
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
before the change I think it was Senate
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 71 which later amended this and
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
what it did was it took the 30% down to
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
23% in the event that it wasn't taxable
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
because 30% was considered frankly harsh
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
the other things that need to be
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
considered and by the way so let me
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
address this bill and then if I can
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
address the prior testim the prior
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses testimony I think it's
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
important first so what this does is is
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
that this adds predictability to the
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
statute the whole point of the entire
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
statute was to add predictability and be
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
able if you're a lawyer or anybody else
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to sit down with your client
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
or if you're asking self represented if
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the statute you'd be able to
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
say to yourself okay this is how it's
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
likely to play out and this is what a
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
court is likely to rule from so if you
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
bring temporary alimony in line but
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the exception that's
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
created in this bill uh specifically
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
addresses a particular need um so when
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
we look about using the the formula
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is 23% currently I'll speak into
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
the microphone nevertheless if you look
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's subject to the formula limits
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
unless a party seeking temporary alimony
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
pleads and the court finds that
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
immediate irreparable economic harm
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
would result If the percentage formula
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
were applied and the the court makes
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
specific uh findings so what that does
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
is that's the safety valve that I think
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
that the people were looking for so if
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
you've really got a significant economic
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
problem that needs immediate addressing
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay the court can simply vary from the
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
formula it's not that rigid um the other
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
thing that I think should so in other
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
words I think this will be good law if I
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
remember correctly last year the or the
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
year before the committee actually
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
passed it and I think it passed pretty
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
much as written through house and
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately got stopped in the Senate
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee so we're re
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
reintroducing it this year the second
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
thing to consider um is and by the way I
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
am I we I will repeat I am
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the prior witness's
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
testimony it felt like she was uh dealt
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
with un it felt like she got the bad end
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
of an economic decision um perhaps a
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
lawyer could have helped her but let me
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
explain this first in alimony
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
considerations alimony is predicated on
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
need and ability to pay um so in other
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
words if one party has a need but the
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
other party has no ability to pay then
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
it is unlikely that alimony is ordered
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
now bear in mind the statute is quite
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
comprehensive you can find people to be
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
voluntarily underemployed if a court
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
thinks you're hiding assets or if a
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
court thinks you're hiding income it can
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
attribute income to you under the terms
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the present statute so it doesn't
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be that percentage
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
number one number two if you're left in
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
a situation alimony is not the only
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
remedy you get in court so for example
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
in addition to alimony a court can order
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
a person who was financially able to pay
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
bills in addition to alimony or in lie
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
of alimony or any combination of them so
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
in other words you can say you're
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
getting an alimony payment you're going
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
to get this alimony not only that but in
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
addition to which I'm ordering you to
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
pay and then you name the bills the
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage the insurance the car payments
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
the telephone whatever else it is so
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
there's a panoply of um of reliefs that
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
are available to you if you're an AG
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
grieved party it it's not that exclusive
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's not everything in alimony courts
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
have that broad General Authority so
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill should stand as it would and I
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
know I it's my opinion and it has wide
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
support because this adds predictability
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
to the the statue rather than have
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
somebody just walk in and say uh uh it's
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
what I think it should be at this time
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
in other words and it what it does is it
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
focuses the pleadings so in other words
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
if you have like I I'll repeat it if you
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
have some kind of immediate irreparable
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
harm that can only be addressed in
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
alimony tell us what it is you'll
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
probably get the
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
order and that's all it is um I'd be
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Mark yes
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
um so it sounds like you want the bill
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
to stand the way it is and be passed the
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
way it is yeah I mean the idea of having
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
50% first of all it's 50% of what um 50%
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
of what of somebody else's total income
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
bear in mind if there are children
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
involved in a case as there frequently
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
are remember that that's in addition to
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
child support and by the way the in
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
terms of the way term alimony is
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
calculated which Cod which is codified
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the alimony statute is that
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
child support is considered income to
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
the obligor Ian to the oblig to the
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
oblig I'm sorry to the in other words to
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the paye so in other words um A and B
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
the paye so in other words um A and B
and

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
and a is asking B for alimony and there
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
are children so B is ordered to pay
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
child support and can be paid alimony in
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
addition to child support because they
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
two they serve two completely different
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
purposes but as the New Hampshire
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court found in Crow V Crow and I
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
think that's back around 2005 more or
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
less was that uh Alum that child support
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
should be considered as income to the
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
obligor to the oblige which is the the
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
person who's getting the child support
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is because they do
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
they do benefit from it you know housing
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and they do benefit from
 
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.669 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and they do benefit from
that

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
so follow up sure um thank you Mr
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Mr maral sure what is the
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
30% I understood the part about the
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
taxes coming out of it so that's what
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
made it 23 why 30% as opposed to 50%
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
well that was that goes back uh that
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh the original bill that
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
became law around 2018 I'll speaking
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
into the microphone around
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
2018 and uh the 30% figure in there was
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
not something I created it was created
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
by another by another group of people
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay and the child and family uh law
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
committee adopted it the problem with
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
30% was that supervening law from
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
the tax code change eliminated the
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
deductibility of alimony so Senate Bill
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
71 I think it was from probably 2019 had
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
to go back in and correct that mistake
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
because 30% of a gross income could be
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
punitive if you don't have to uh if
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to deduct it from
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
income okay deducted as an adjustment to
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
income which it was sub from the more
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
than you might want to know
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
Department um it created that the
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform created some initial
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
problems as to what was going to happen
 
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.389 align:start position:0%
problems as to what was going to happen
with

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
2018 uh as to the deductibility of
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
alimony so there was this tremendous
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
rush in 2017 and 18 to get all of these
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
cases settled if you were going to be in
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
an alimony situation because after 2018
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
the deductibility of alimony disappeared
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
so ba uh so in other words you now how
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
to case you could not deduct it it was
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
not an adjustment to income alimony
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
served not only completely different
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
purposes but it was actually uh the tax
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
advantages made it strategically
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
advantageous for both parties depending
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
on the circumstances so for example um
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
I'll give you more in the way of alimony
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
based on the deductibility of uh the
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
alimony payment which is what it was if
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
we can do this and this and this so both
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
parties would get an advantage to some
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
extent okay so now alimony is basically
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
in the same class as child support in
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
status representative McMahon thank you
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Atty Markel uh your
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
clarification um relative to what
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is proposing is uh just in
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
quotes it's temporary alimony correct
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay relative uh to where it states in
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
here that it ends on the effective date
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
of the divorce but if there's children
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
involved still expenses of the the other
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
party mhm is there a different part of
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
this bill that needs to be recognized
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
for permanent alimony no no um the way
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
the bill currently works the way the
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
statute currently works is you have
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
different classes of alimony you have
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
term alimony which is the most popular
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
one you have some reimbursement alimony
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
and uh you have temporary alimony a
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
reimbursement alimony would be it's
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
generally not seen too much but it was
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
used in the past as a way of reimbursing
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody for example in Li of a property
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
settlement uh typically it might be
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
something along the lines and I'll
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
be I'll be
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
stereotypical uh one party puts the
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
other party through medical school and
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
works at a lower income job the other
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
party gets through medical school and
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
now is a successful physician and now
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
successful physician decides the
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
marriage is through well what happens uh
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
to the spouse who put that spouse
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
through medical school and that can be
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
remedied in reimbursement alimony that's
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
one way to do it um as far as the rest
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
of it goes the rest of the language is
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
is okay I mean there are problems in the
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
statute first of all we have the I mean
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
if I can go beyond this sir in answering
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'd rather you not and just focus
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
specifically on what's before us okay
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you sorry one followup
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
followup and thank you for that I'll
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
take your class later like like to learn
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
more on this um the other question is
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
and this is for me uh is what is when it
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
says on a proposed amendment versus
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill not in the bill but
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
refers to it
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
23% of of what is that a is that a
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
greven or what it's the difference
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
between adjusted incomes uh usually what
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
courts ask for uh is an alimony
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
worksheet and uh unfortunately it
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to me that the Judiciary
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
has created that is put on a website so
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
most practitioners end up doing it on
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
their own and what you do is is that
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
they will take a gross income from each
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
party then they will make certain
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
deductions for example who's paying for
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
health care and who's doing this and
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
that will be create a deduction and you
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
can create an alimony worksheet and then
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
you can take 23% of the difference of
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
their adjusted incomes and that becomes
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
the alimony order councel wearing my
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%

from my committee might be to the
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%

um I guess in terms of this bill I hope
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
everybody has the handout that was
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
provided um which one in particular well
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
there was a there should be four to five
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
pages starting with a bar news article
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh two statutes uh Dom IC uh protocols
 
00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
for the Family Division in relation to
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
protective orders and
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
contempt and uh there should be a copy
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
of the number of case filings printed
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
for 2023 from the New Hampshire Court
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um I guess as an opening
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
statement here the the point of this
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh I think there's a real need for this
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill and the primary purpose would be to
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
ensure the even-handed administration of
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
justice and to clarify some things that
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
are out there that have been kind of
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
murky um for years because the issue of
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
contempt is an important one and I don't
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of prosay who really
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
understand what it is and there's a lot
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
of court and I'm going to ask you to
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
stop please because we including me um
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
have been distracted with uh passing
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
papers out and we missed and what little
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
I did hear of it sounded pretty good so
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
I bet the more of it it'll be better yet
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
so could you just hang on for one second
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
please sure no problem
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
sir did you have do you have two of the
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
everything that came by okay good thank
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
second we're good councelor please start
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
over Okay thank you um well my name is j
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
marel I'm an attorney in New Hampshire
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I've been practicing family law as a
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
career changer now for' been admitted
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
since 1998 so I've been practicing law
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
for a while with a concentration in
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
family law um and this bill deals with
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
codifying what a contempt is and making
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
the law fairer simpler and easier to
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
understand because we have so many
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
self-represented um I think it's
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
instructive first to understand the
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
history of contempt and if you look at a
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire bar news article which is
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
top there um it was authored uh I
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
authored this and uh it deals with the
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
history of it to give some background
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's an old concept and it really goes
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
back to the king of England uh the
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
anglo-american history of contempt is
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
such that it goes back to the earliest
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
references that I could find in law
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
review articles was actually to a
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
Shakespearean play in
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
1547 it ultim It ultimately became uh an
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
an offense in the anglo-american
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
tradition was actually an offense if you
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
disrespected the king you were actually
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
disrespecting the courts because the
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
courts were representative of the king
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
so if you didn't follow Court's orders
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay you were disrespecting the king and
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh then the remedies from that flowed uh
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
it could be anything from incarceration
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
all the way through so I provide that
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
for a brief reference and it also
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
provides um an article for you to read
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
view to get the idea of what statutory
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
standards should be um now when you look
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the bill when you look at it um
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different things to
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
talk about and in the family law context
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with a wide sweep what
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
it does is it deals with all of the
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
family all the matters that come within
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of RSA
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
49-2 D2 which is jurisdiction so it not
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
only comes in with divorce anality
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
custody of children actions for support
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh abuse and neglect
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
hearings uh DVP uh issues RSA 173b which
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're all familiar with
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
adoptions so it is universally
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
applicable the um and when you look at
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
the bill just want to make sure I've got
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
it out here to review
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
it what it says is basically it defines
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
what a contemp of Court means it means
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
that you have to have an undoubted and
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
willful Disobedience of a valid C
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
unequivocal court order so these are key
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
things okay and it has okay now new and
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
by the way I don't invent this this is
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire case law okay uh so so
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
actually none of what's being offered
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
here is revolutionary or new or untested
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
this is all well settled
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
stuff um so when you look at it willful
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the context means a failure to act
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
means an act or failure to act that is
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
voluntary and intentional and not
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
accidental so it doesn't even
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
malicious okay it can be but it doesn't
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and so when you look and when we look
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
at section two uh we're talking about
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
how these things are enforced and that's
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to be enforcement on abuse Al
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
all the child support and everything
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
else within RSA 490d to now we talk
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
about where the burden of proof is the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is going to be on the
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
party seeking the enforcement by a
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence means
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
simply more likely than not it's you've
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
got the ball over the
 
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.390 align:start position:0%
got the ball over the
net

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and and if you don't have just cause
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
as a defense for why you didn't and why
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
you didn't uh obey the order there can
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
the court May award reasonable costs and
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees to the prevailing party
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
okay now and here's a here's a point
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
which I think some people may
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstand we're talking about here
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
order the incarceration of a contor
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
until such time as the contamin complies
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
with the Court's order and uh let's deal
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
with this it's an extraordinary remedy
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's one that doesn't happen too often
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
um typically you see it in willful
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
refusals uh
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
and it like I said it doesn't happen too
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
often but nevertheless people do need to
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
know that it's out there because
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
um it just is and typically that doesn't
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
happen but but for example in
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when you're served with a
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
complaint summons uh for contempt uh
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's noticed right then and there that
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
you may be incarcerated uh so what this
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
does is is that the intent here is to
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
provide notice for any potential content
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
there and they're out there uh that you
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
could go to jail for something like this
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's possible so this is
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
notice um where is it typically used um
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
willful refusal to obey a court order
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'll give you one
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
example um I had a case where we had
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed somebody in for child support
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
records and the party simply refused was
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
behind on his child support had a
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
lengthy criminal record turns out his
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
girlfriend was working for the company
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
that um he was working for we subpoenaed
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
their records and it turns out his
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
girlfriend was The Keeper of the records
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and uh they would refuse to provide the
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
records now bear in mind this was the
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
same organization that we had
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
successfully subpoenaed records for in
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
the past on a different case uh we
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
brought it to the attention of the Court
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
the court ordered a uh subpoena uh
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
subpoena ad testificandum deces techum
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
which is which is legal g g for you're
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
coming into court you're bringing the
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
records and you're going to testify okay
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
and in there was a note that you may you
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
may be put on for a show cause hearing
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you refuse to comply show cause is
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
the step before
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration and what it does is it's
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
basically you're going to have to tell
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
us why we shouldn't order you to be
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated okay so incarceration may
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
result um and I don't want you to think
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
that this is fostering people going to
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
jail it almost never happens in New
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's possible um so when
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
we look at it uh and nothing in this
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to limit or
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
preclude any other rights comma remedies
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
comma or causes of action that may exist
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
under any other statute so when you look
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
at contempt there are different forms of
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
contempt and there are different
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
remedies so the court has a wide variety
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
of remedies that it can impose
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
so why should we do this okay a people
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
really need to know how to plead these
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
cases judges really need to know
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
standards and guidance as to what they
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
should be using in the way of doing it
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
it makes from the judicial standpoint it
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
makes writing your findings of fact much
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
easier because all you have to do is
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
look at the case look at the statute and
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
you can apply the facts as to why a
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
person is in contempt or isn't in
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
contempt um and then what the possible
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
remedy is going to be um one of the
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
things that I had noticed here was that
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
um the Judiciary had weighed in and um
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
it says that it thinks the cost of
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
incarceration may be a considerating
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a consideration um I can tell you
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
that in my research I have not
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
seen any time that the cost of Inc that
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
if a court was seriously considering
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerating an individual that the
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
cost of incarceration was actually a
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
consideration uh not in 500 years if
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen that if a court is considering
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
placing as a court is considering
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
putting you in jail now bear in mind
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
also in your handout you will see
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 10 which is violations of
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
protective orders and
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
contempt now these are not binding they
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
come out of the New Hampshire rules of
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
court from the Family Division um and
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
when you look at it you will see here
 
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a couple of issues that I
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
have to deal with while these might be
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
considered best practices they create
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
gism I'll explain to you what I mean um
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
first it talks about jurisdiction and it
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
talks about the types of contempt and
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
the types of contempt which are civil
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
contempt which is what this would be and
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
um what it talks about here it does not
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form reference the a
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
court to consider whether or not there's
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
going to be a cost of incarceration it
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
would seem that if the Judiciary were
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
considered that to be that serious it
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
would have been included certainly in
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
the protocols it's simply not um the
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
other issues that I see with the present
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
Protocols are that they create two
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
completely different standards um if you
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
look for example
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
on let's see where it is the standard of
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
proof used under the um protocols what
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're asking you to do is use um
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
is use a clear and convincing evidence
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
standard but only for two things
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
violation of parenting and domestic
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
violence petition okay so people who
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
don't pay their child support don't get
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
that benefit uh in other words you're
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually making it harder to prove a
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
contempt okay and giving more due
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
process protection to somebody who
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
violates the court order in terms of
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence which may have more
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
serious consequences than somebody who
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
willfully refuses to pay a child support
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
now bear in mind the overwhelming
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
majority of research that I've looked at
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
establishes civil contempt which is
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
different from Criminal contempt and
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt is not a part of this
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
statute uh is preponderance of the
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
evidence is the generally accepted
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
standard um so there's a there there's a
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
there's a um there's a dichotomy here
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
and finally uh two more key points
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
number one when we look if you look at
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
the statute in presently that's in place
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's RSA
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
4851 attorneys fees in contempt of court
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
cases that's should be included in the
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
handout what it does is is that it says
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
okay if one party can prove the other
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
party is in contempt the court shallow
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
word Ator attorney's fees but
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the statute is absolutely
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
blank on what constitutes a
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
contempt so we don't have that here so
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we add that and put that in
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
so everybody can see what it is and one
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the other things that I think is
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
worth looking at is uh how important is
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
this well if you look at a chart
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
published by the New Hampshire judicial
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
branch that's included here is how many
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
cases that were in
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
2023 and if you look at it from all the
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
various filings adoption surrender
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
domestic matters domestic violence and
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
all the way through you're going to see
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
that there were a total filings of
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
15,1 155 cases for 2023 that's a lot of
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
filings in my opinion for a state as
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
small as we are and so
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
sorry okay it's on the it's it's on the
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
so this is not merely an isolated or
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
inconsequential issue this is a
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
significant this will deal with a
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
significant portion of family law cases
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the one thing I was not
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
able to find out from the Judiciary was
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
how many contempt actions are actually
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
filed they're listed here okay or how
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
many motions for a contempt are actually
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
filed during a case while it's in
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
progress which is typically what happens
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
um the one change that this bill makes
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
from the current statute is is that the
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
current statute says that a court shall
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
award attorney's fees the proposed bill
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
says that the court May award attorney's
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
fees I think I'm respectfully suggesting
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
that I think we need that discretion uh
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
for a court to be able to determine
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
whether the conduct is egregious enough
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay given the uh given the standards
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
that are provided um I think that's
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
important and what it does is and
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
finally what it does is is that it not
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
only improves the administration of
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
justice but what it does is is that it
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
allows parties to effectively argue
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
their case you can say one party says
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
the other part is in contempt because
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
because because because because and the
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
other party can stand up and say I'm not
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
in contempt because because because
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
because because and then the Court
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
decides because these are basically
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.309 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative long thank you
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you attorney Mel yes
 
00:52:07.319 --> 00:52:08.349 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you attorney Mel yes
sir

00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
um for part for uh parties that are
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
financially strapped
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
right would this better get them an
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
attorney representation knowing the
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh reimbursement so if I
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
had no money to to get an attorney the
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
answer would be no I don't have an
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
attorney right the the fact that the
 
00:52:32.359 --> 00:52:33.950 align:start position:0%
attorney right the the fact that the
potential

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would I be able
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
to uh would more attorneys be more apt
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
to represent people knowing that there's
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
a potential for a reimbursement um I
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it goes one way or the other
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I don't think it does
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
is because there's such a very high
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who are
 
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.789 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who are
self-represented

00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think attorneys take cases
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily because they think they're
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to get attorneys fees in family
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
law okay uh you know there's a
 
00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
difference and you certainly can't take
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
it on a percentage basis for the most
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
part um what it does is is that it
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
allows the court the
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
discretion uh because this and I think
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I'm trying to answer your
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
question yeah no yeah you did I I have a
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
followup followup um so that a higher
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
percent just Pro say so there would be
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
no reimbursement there's no attorneys fa
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
then uh and one more followup I one more
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
followup uh now you mentioned to uh you
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
recommend keeping it at May uh let the
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
judge decide if it's egregious enough
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
yes sitting on this committee for years
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
and and hearing from the family uh Court
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh committee um it seems like judges
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
give a lenience for you know I'll let
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
you do it once I'll let you do it twice
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
maybe so that's why I'm wondering if the
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
shell would
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
work um I in my opinion I'm seeing
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
judges with a lot of leniency so even
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
though something may be egregious maybe
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
not that bad um the may may give um you
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
know may may give a Break um you could
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
certainly do you see that yeah um I can
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand it um I can understand uh I
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
would certainly be amenable to an
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment if it wanted to retain that
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
piece of the L that piece of the present
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
statute I think that would be fine um my
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
only concern was allowing judicial
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
discretion uh because they can find you
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
in contempt they can order you to pay a
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
variety of things they have broad
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
discretion as to the remedies they can
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
fashion for somebody who's found in
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
contempt uh and that's why I said may
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
not shall uh the question is how far
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
does it go
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's why it was there great thank
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
you any other questions yes
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Greg representative
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
Grossman I'm getting there I'm working
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
through the G's thank
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman Pon thank you um
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
for coming before us so what are the
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
current remedies that are being used for
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
contempt and just to so you're saying
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
that this helps Define contempt gives so
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
you and what are the current ways that
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
if someone is in contempt it's at the
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion there's not right um
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
well typically the remedy is
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
um order compliance okay I now order you
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
to comply and if you don't I'm finding
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
you in contempt and now if I don't order
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
you to comply I'll put it on for show
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
cause Okay so that's one way of doing it
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh show causes you're in contempt now
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay and if you go and if you do this
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
again you're going to be in show I'll
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
put it on for a show cause that means
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to put you that you're you
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
got a real good shot of going to jail if
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
you're not complying with my order
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's the way it would be uh the other
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
remedies can be as wide as the situation
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
requires uh it can be additional
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
parenting time for somebody who's
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
withholding parenting uh that's why we
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
say we don't paint anybody into a
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
quarter on this nothing precludes any
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
other rights or remedies so nobody's
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
painted into a corner I'm hope I'm
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
answering your question if I'm not oh
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bickford thank you
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you again sure um so
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is uh it's in case
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
law right with the exception of the not
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
right and uh and you want to have it
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
codified so it would be more available
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
to the uh you said POS which is people
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
representing themselves correct thank
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah the idea here is is that the
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
average pro isn't going to be uh on the
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
case law websites looking this stuff up
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have access to that
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
even if they type in contempt of court
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going to know what the
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
elements are and so this would give
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody cause for pause because you can
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
click on a website you can go right to
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
the statutes and you can find out
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have a case for
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
contempt or whether or not I better not
 
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
because they will have a contast for
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
contempt because and so people can frame
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
their pleadings and like I said before
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
judges can now look at it here are the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
facts here's the law the other thing
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
that helps judges is when you read
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
narratives they have no place to go this
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
is the really weird part judges actually
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
have to cut and paste their findings on
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
their narratives so in other words um I
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
look at it and I look at the narratives
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
and it says in contempt for and then it
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
be State V not in contempt because of
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
this this and this and they actually
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
have to cite case law now all you have
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
to do instead of cutting Pace like that
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
to put your narratives together all you
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
really have to do is just look at the
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
bang thank you so much and before you go
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
when it says and other remedies that no
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
longer includes banishment to Australia
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
does it no it doesn't Okay that died in
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic on the way over thank you
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you sir and I thank the
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
committ and Council was presenting for
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor as well because you've
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
worked this out now we go into our
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
three-minute drill testimony confined to
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
three minutes and Veterans of this
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee will know that you can say
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
your point very well in three minutes um
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Katrina Hinrich
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
yep I think I provided testimony enough
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
for everybody but I do have an extra of
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
it and we start I am Katrina again I
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to this bill not in
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily a total opposition but some
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
clarification just because there is such
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
a high self-representation that occurs
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
so transparency and understanding of the
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
laws is definitely difficult for a lot
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
of people some of the issues I wanted to
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
address was
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
considering what what is a valid court
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
order what makes it a valid court order
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
you look at the US code of title
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
28636 it talks about the jurisdiction
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
and powers of of what a in our state a
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
master does or a
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
magistrate uh orders from the family
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
court as we know because we have a
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
special committee may have attributes
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
that perhaps improperly reflect what a
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
valid order is so I referen to the
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
2007 New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
that talks about how marital Masters are
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
authorized to make
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations which though they're
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
normally approved they have no binding
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
Force upon the
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
court they are not judicial officers
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
according to our own
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
State stakeholder testimony has
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
reflected that such orders are not
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
signed frequently if not
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
consistently and that's gone over the
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
years we've gone back in testimony from
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
from critical
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so looking at that there's
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
a there's a possible conflict there I
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
think that needs kind
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
of sought out a little bit more as to
 
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
what the details and and actuality of
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
what a valid court order is for all
 
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.670 align:start position:0%
what a valid court order is for all
these

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
self-representations and then there's
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
also the concern that has come forward
 
01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:24.349 align:start position:0%
also the concern that has come forward
about

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
consent whether
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
in our family courts the marital Masters
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
are actually getting consent as required
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
under rule
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
73 in the code
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
636 there's some other issues
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
um concerning the
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
hearings that they have to be conducted
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
by a district judge upon certification
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the facts and again there seems to be
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
a little conflict in what we actually do
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
and then the final thing I'll draw
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
attention to is the preponderance of the
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
evidence piece
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be a large arbitrary
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of testimony to the
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrariness of this and the rules of
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
evidence and how they are or are not
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
applied and overall the bill is a
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism to deliver consequences upon
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
domestic relation litigant resulting
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
from these
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
orders it just seems Pro students to
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
really dive into what is a valid court
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
order are we actually putting out valid
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
court orders according to both federal
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
and state
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
law I think a clear understanding for
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
court litigant you know is important as
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
it is for legislators to understand what
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
litigant go through throughout this
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
process and that is really what I wanted
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.309 --> 01:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
thank you with 30 seconds to spare um
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
anyone with a question from the
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
welcome chair recognizes Dana alre who
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
has a lot of stuff to give
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
us that's not a technical term by the
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
way it says you have 18 copies of four
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
exhibits well there's only four handouts
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure you had enough
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
copies of the four handouts thank you so
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
much three minutes starts now well so
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
the committee again Dana alre NAU in New
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm a father of four as a
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
very brief background I think that one
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the many things that went wrong in my
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
family law case is that my parenting
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
plan was never followed uh so I'm
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what I believe are some
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
good intentions in this bill
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh with that said I'm very concerned
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
about certain specific language and
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequences so
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
rather than be for or against this it's
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
my hope I can give you a little
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
constructive feedback that's hopefully
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
valuable and
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
relevant so with that said if we can
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
address specific language in the bill
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
itself uh so I think one of the things
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is spell out
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
specifically what stuff
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
means and that's a laudable
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
goal so I suppose I'm uh one of those
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
confused prosay
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
litigants uh we heard from chy barkle
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'm confused about what a
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
valid and unequivocal court order really
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
means uh so one of your handouts is a
 
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
means uh so one of your handouts is a
one

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
pager uh that says it's a list of
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
judges uh in the NH circuit court and on
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you'll see judges but you'll also
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
see a perdia marital Master you'll see
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
Senior active judges you'll see judicial
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
referees also known as retired judges
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll see referees that are
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys appointed per
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
RSA uh 490 uh
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
F5 and as a second handout if you look
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
at what the first circuit federal court
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
of appeals decided in Whit V justices of
 
01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:33.069 align:start position:0%
of appeals decided in Whit V justices of
New

01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it says that uh Masters
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
have no inherent power but rather derive
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
all their power from the appointed
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
appointing judge or the agreement
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
parties agreement of the parties so my
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
first question is how whether and under
 
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.950 align:start position:0%
first question is how whether and under
what

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances do the actions of the pur
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
DM active senior retired judges referees
 
01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.269 align:start position:0%
DM active senior retired judges referees
appointed

01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:06:01.279 --> 01:06:02.829 align:start position:0%
appointed
attorneys

01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
count as a valid and unequivocal court
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
order per this proposed
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
statute so if you kind of compare the
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
wit opinion from the Federal First
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to an email written to me
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
on February 15
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
2022 uh so that's the third handout by a
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
judge in my
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
case uh she writes to me that she
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
suspects she was a
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
co-signer uh well what exactly is a
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
co-signer and what's the legal
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
definition of that
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
term and she also says she didn't make
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
any decisions in my case
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
substantively so what does that mean
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
confused prosay litigant do we need
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
something in this bill about the differ
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
between a decision that's made you know
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
substantively versus one that's not
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
because our non-sub substantive
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
decisions valid and unequivocal court
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
orders or not uh if you also hand out
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
for uh which is just a transcript from
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
administrative judge king on uh August
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
2622 uh he talks about cosign or
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
cosigned on page nine so you've got a
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
half a minute uh so you can see that on
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
the second to the last page that's the
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
corrections page so again cosine or
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
cosine um I think you said you owed me
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
30 seconds last time I did you're in the
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
bank go okay I think that's critical
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
because when you get to section four of
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
itself it just said the court well what
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
part of the Court does that include
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
attorneys appointed it will that the
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
federal for circuit says have no
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
inherent power does 4 a mean attorneys
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
with no inherent power can force
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
litigant to pay fees to other attorneys
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean prosay parties paying
 
01:08:15.669 --> 01:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
fees to representative
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
parties and when we get to 4B does that
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
mean attorneys with no inherent power
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
can incarcerate people for how long in
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
until such time as the contempor
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
complies mean indefinitely you know what
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
if the contempts for not paying attorney
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
fees will you take questions and by the
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
way for the record you owe me nine
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
seconds next time okay uh for anyone
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
with a question for Mr
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%

incarceration uh and I just say that's a
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
pretty wide
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
sweep okay thank you any further
 
01:09:23.839 --> 01:09:26.590 align:start position:0%

you seeing none thank you so much thank
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes Susan bristen
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
is that attorney Susan it was last time
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
disbarment good morning I'm Susan
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
bristen I'm the chief staff attorney for
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
the office of Child
 
01:09:46.679 --> 01:09:51.309 align:start position:0%
the office of Child
Support

01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
um our office is um against this B
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
mostly because I think it's not
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
necessary most of what it covers is
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
already in case law I would also point
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
out that there is
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
a in the Family Division court rules
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
looking at rule 2.31 enforcement of
 
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
looking at rule 2.31 enforcement of
court

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
order um it talks about bringing a
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
contempt action in an open case and
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
bringing a contempt action in a closed
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
case it even mentions that there is a
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
motion for contempt a standard motion
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
that you can get off the website for for
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
the court which they just have to fill
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
out so it's not that uh somebody who's
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
searching for this remedy has to create
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
um one order uh one other thing I I
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
pointing out and this
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
is because my brain likes completeness
 
01:10:54.679 --> 01:10:55.950 align:start position:0%
is because my brain likes completeness
um

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
is I if
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bill was was was going to go forward
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
I would suggest an amendment um with
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
regards to um in line well starting in
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral 4 with regards
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
to attorneys costs and incarceration I
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
would suggest that there should be a c
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
for anything um other that the court
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
would deem to be Equitable because right
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
now it's just you can get attorneys or
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
you can put somebody in jail seems to me
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the court should have the ability to to
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
craft some other remedies as is
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
case any
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh seat filler colum
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
kcom thank you Mr chairman my Irish wife
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
would be very upset I didn't pronounce
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
that correctly Kum I'm not sure that
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's an Irish name so will not tell my
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
wife in any case thank you you get a
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
pass uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned case law can you explain
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
to me the difference between our statute
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
law and case law and how the case law
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
would Prevail over our
 
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
statute oh that's a difficult question
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
um case law um is usually used to to
 
01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
fill in the statute comes
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
first um and that and I think listening
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
to Mr markel's testimony that he wasn't
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
meaning to really change the law he was
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
just meaning to put it all in one place
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
as opposed to case law sometimes when
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
you read it is a little bit here a
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
little bit there a little bit there and
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of amalgam IE it
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
together so it's an attempt this is an
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
attempt to sort of put it all in one
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
place so that everybody can go oh this
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
is what this is what you have to do and
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
not look in 16 16
 
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.390 align:start position:0%
not look in 16 16
places

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
mhm working on a few items in the Rules
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
of Evidence book with members of the
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary where there is case law that's
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
a bit squiffy uh we're concluding that
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes putting it actually in
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
statute makes it clearer even if some
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
would say it's clear in case law would
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
you agree I would agree um and I think
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
that the that's the legislature's meant
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
to to be the M the top of the three
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
branches so legislation would come from
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
well your colleagues in the Judiciary
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
agree so I'm still on this project with
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bickford uh
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
person um you mentioned about an
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and I I didn't catch it all it
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
was something about other remedies I
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
think could you point out exactly where
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
that should go and if you don't want to
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
do it now I'll take it later well sure
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's in Roman numeral 4 It's So
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's talking about if a party alleges
 
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
and the court finds that that a party is
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
in contempt it goes on to list with the
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
remedies that the court May award costs
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
and attorney's fees order the
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
incarceration of the
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
contor um I would suggest that c c

do uh speeches and piis and you never

know if a bill's coming off consent so
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
you want to be ready uh probably the
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
worst preparation was a time in my first
 
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
year when the chairman didn't know the
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
bill was coming off consent and wanted
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
me to give the pi and I walked up and
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
said hey what's the bill and so he told
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
me and my Pi was Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
that the people uh voting for this bill
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
really were smart would I not vote for 4
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
to and I had no clue what the bill was

this
 
01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.070 align:start position:0%
this
1659

01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
1659
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
relative um
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
parenting if a child is taken from his
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
or her
 
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
parent for two
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
years and brought back to the other
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
parent are we going going to punish that
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
child by not allowing that child to see
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
the former parent because the former
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
parent did the wrong thing are we
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
child I I I just I think that this bill
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
amended to remove that language and then
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
I would go on to where it says within a
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
2-year period two years a long time to
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
wait to rectify a situation I would like
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
to see it uh amended
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
to um 30 days so I would like to ask Mr
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
chairman if we could
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session on this
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
bill so that um I and anyone else who
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
would like to can sit with
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative post and talk to
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
represent ative post about an
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and it is your intention that
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
we would then uh finish the executive
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
session on the 5th of March we would
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
postpone that from today until that two
 
01:36:38.199 --> 01:36:40.830 align:start position:0%
postpone that from today until that two
weeks

01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes I believe that is
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
allowable representative
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman we do have
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
another bill that um was Prime sponsored
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
by representative cutab that really does
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
cover a lot of this but doesn't have
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
that um punitive aspect where it's using
 
01:37:02.189 --> 01:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
the child more as like a a pawn so to
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
speak or as a chest piece in this so
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
there is another I I don't want to
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
duplicate bills we do have one that's
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly similar similar that has
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
already passed through this committee um
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
so I would like to look at that and make
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not because if we amend
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill we're going to be
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
like in step with this other one so I
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
really don't know if that's necessary on
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
you and for clarification uh this bill
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
already okay we'll get back to
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh as far as representative
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
deon's uh points
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
um the two years is so you can have time
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
to not have to squish all the time at
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
all at once for the uh of parent so the
 
01:37:57.149 --> 01:37:57.159 align:start position:0%
courts have plenty of time to do that so
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
I I think that's it's appropriate the
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
way it is they we need to leave a
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
discretion for the courts as to how they
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
want to uh uh fit that into the both
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents time your point being on line 18
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say at the 2 Anniversary it
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
said onor before it right so it could be
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
a year it could be six months right okay
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for giving me time to
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
look that up so it was um house bill
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
10006 with Amendment um
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
40448 and it was passed through
 
01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:34.270 align:start position:0%
40448 and it was passed through
committee

01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
unanimously two weeks ago and it's yeah
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
my short-term memory being what it is
 
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
okay and you believe that 1006
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
adequately addresses the concern without
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
some of the possible negatives without
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
without the um extensive punitive damage
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
that I think would be more harmful to
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
else so are we moving towards a motion
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
of itl does it sound that way thumbs
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
before we make an official motion that
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
we may regret okay how many think we
 
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.709 align:start position:0%
 
OTP

01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%

01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
finger and she's
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
not well then uh
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%

rights of parents that primary sponsor
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%

technical
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
questions um so we're opening that
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr 17 we will have a
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
hearing on 25 uh
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
shortly and what would anybody like to
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
share with the committee on this
 
01:43:23.679 --> 01:43:28.510 align:start position:0%
share with the committee on this
cacr

01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
17 and you can make comparisons to 25 if
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%

representative

01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chair I think that
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh reading both of the ccrs um and going
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
over the content of both cacr
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
17 seems to address the parental rights
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
and protect the children children at the
 
01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
and protect the children children at the
same

01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
time I think it's uh they're both well
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
thought out I applaud both of the
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors I'm just more amenable to the
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
fact that cacr
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
17 um that is the representative
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli um
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
cacr I think it's more complete it it
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
takes more of the fundamental rights
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
into consideration and I'm just more
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.910 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
it

01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%

year um last year we had this battle on

uh s
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
and8 um would end life or otherwise

physically harm a child um Psy I'm
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
thinking psychological or emotional
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
which testimony we were told that those
 
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:13.790 align:start position:0%
which testimony we were told that those
would

01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
still uh apply speaking with attorneys
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
um they're not together with those
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
statutes still applying
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh so that's one issue I have with that
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%

three uh to add this uh to add this
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
question uh via warrant um I I know
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
there was some I know there's a statute
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
that sort of brings that all together
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
with respect to references of city and
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
towns but I don't know if warrants uh if
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%

01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%

representative

01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman Mr
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
chairman every time uh a parental Bill
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
of Rights comes up I always ask the
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
question do parental rights already
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
exist and the answer that I get again
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
and again and again is that in fact they
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
do the problem I have with this bill and
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
all parental rights bills is it gives a
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
false impression to the public that uh
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
they do not have parental rights when in
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
fact they do um I think it's it's a bit
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
deceptive um when parents feel that
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
their rights the rights that they have
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
have been violated it would be better
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
for us to direct them as to where their
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
concerns can be
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
remedied otherwise we put into statute
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
something that already exists they think
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
they have new rights and are emboldened
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
when in fact they have nothing more so I
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
do see it as a bit deceptive and I'd
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
like us to encourage parents to go to
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
where they need to go to to remedy the
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
violated thank you anyone
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
else uh representative Raymond thank you
 
01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um first of all I'd like to
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
say I agree with representative desimon
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
about her analysis of the the two bills
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
the compare and contrast um I think that
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
um the cordelli version is um more
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate than the uh other version
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
the cacr 25 um however my concern is
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the language on lines um five six
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
and seven um and and that says uh
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
neither the state nor any political
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall infringe on these
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
rights without demonstrating that its
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest as
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
applied to the person is of the highest
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
order and not otherwise served currently
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
well we know that the highest order and
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest is the
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
absolute highest burden of proof that
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
there is um so that is much higher than
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
everything else earlier today we had um
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
an attorney in here talking about the
 
01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.310 align:start position:0%
an attorney in here talking about the
differ

01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
differ
 
01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
between um a preponderance of the
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
evidence um versus I forget what the
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
other thing what the other phrase was um
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
and he was supporting changing it to a
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
propon of the evidence because he felt
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
like that was a more appropriate civil
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
thing this we're now saying instead of a
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence for dcyf
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
to intervene in cases we're going to say
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
it has to be of the
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
highest um order in order for DCF to
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
intervene my concern is even though
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
they've indicated in the line this be
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
shall not be construed to apply to uh a
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
decision that would end life or
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
physically harm a child my concern is
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to interfere with dcf's
 
01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
ability to assess and intervene in cases
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
where um there is suspected child abuse
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
or not or mal treatment I'm also
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
concerned because the carve out is only
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
for murdering your child or physically
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
injuring your child but it doesn't say
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything about your other decisions that
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
impact your child's health and
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
well-being so what if I was neglecting
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
my child what if I decided that my right
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
to direct the upbringing education and
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
care of my child was to tell my
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
14-year-old that they need to drop out
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
of school and go to work
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
full-time does the government have a
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
compelling interest of the highest order
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent me from doing that the
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says no we don't under
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
that stat that level of scrutiny that's
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
why for example Amish people in
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania are allowed to pull their
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
children out of school at 14 even though
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania has a loss saying that
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's compulsory education until 18 so
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we're banding about
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
these legal terms that we don't fully
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand the ramifications of and so
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
unless there is some sort of amendment
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
that would assure us that this would not
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
open the door to trafficking um neglect
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
psychological or emotional neglect of
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
children I I just can't support putting
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
something in our Constitution that is
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be in the best interest of
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
child well-being the chair would ask if
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
retired Supreme Court Justice chief
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
justice and current Judiciary chairman
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
Robert Lynn would care to come up and
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
comment on the narrow question of
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
highest burden in lines 5 to7 here what
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
does that give what does that remove if
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
well I guess what I would say is I mean
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's certainly true that that is you
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
know compelling State interest is is the
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
is sort of the highest uh burden that um
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
that legislation would have to meet to
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
um to survive a constitutional challenge
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
for example if this if this amendment
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
were if this amendment were adopted um
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
and given the uh you know I I tend to
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
think that that the the example given I
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
mean there is a US Supreme Court case
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Amish children in
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
Pensylvania um that that says what what
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
she indicated um so that I mean it that
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
would seem to indicate that that would
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
not be a compelling State interest but I
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
do think I mean my sense is that having
 
01:51:44.719 --> 01:51:45.709 align:start position:0%
do think I mean my sense is that having
that

01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
standard is appropriate
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
because um it
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights are very very important
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the state should
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
interfere with those rights only when it
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
has a very very important reason for
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
doing so and I you know I although
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
it we all might say you know we all
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
might sort
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
of individually question you know is it
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
really is it really the right decision
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
for promish people in that example to
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
say their kids can leave school at
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
14 you know I don't think I wouldn't
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
make that decision I suspect that most
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
of you wouldn't either but I I guess I
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
do agree in the ultimately with the
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision it is that it
 
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me that you know they given the
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
religion the religious Traditions that
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
they have in that in that Faith that's
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think that the government
 
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
should be second guessing that uh
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
however you know ever much I might
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
personally not be one that would make
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
that choice so does the rest of the
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that say and not otherwise
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
served give DCF and OCA uh opportunity
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
to inter
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
intervene uh in some of the cases that
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
are not murder that we could see
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
happening oh sure yes I mean I would yes
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
for sure which certainly it would seem
 
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
to me that you know I I would not in any
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
way uh inter if you P if this
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment past I would
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
not in any way say that that you know
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
um prevents DCF from investigating child
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
abuse or uh or neglect or any of those
 
01:53:35.679 --> 01:53:37.189 align:start position:0%
abuse or uh or neglect or any of those
things

01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
um that would be my view anyway so that
 
01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:43.719 align:start position:0%
additional phrase perhaps would address
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
what representative Raymond's concern
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
was with the words highest
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
order right I think so I mean I would
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
not you know I as I say I would not in
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
any way uh interpret that to mean
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
know for lack of a better term ordinary
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Services because I
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
think those things are you know those
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
things are of the highest
 
01:54:14.069 --> 01:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
order any questions uh for you while
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
you're up here representative
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
grossan well done chairman well
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
done um well it wouldn't prevent them
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
from investigating but would it prevent
 
01:54:30.589 --> 01:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
them from having
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
findings gez I would think not I mean I
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know if the I mean you know let me
 
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
let me let me give you this example
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
which I again you know that obviously
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
any of these things in the area of
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional law it really depends on
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
the particular facts and circumstances
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to give a you know this is
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
the right answer I but but for
 
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.430 align:start position:0%
the right answer I but but for
example

01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
um if if this if this Constitutional
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment were in
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
effect perhaps it gives more um more
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
weight to a parents claim that
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
um there's only so far the state can go
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
in becoming kind of a nanny State uh you
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
know in other words I just just to give
 
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
an example when you know when I was a
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
kid when I was a kid and that's a long
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
time ago for sure but when I was a kid
 
01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
you know I uh I walked to school
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
probably starting when I was I don't
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
know maybe you know six years old or so
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think I'm pretty sure I walked to
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
school when I was in first or second
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
grade and it was you know it was three
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
a so well I don't know if I call it so
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
the it wasn't it wasn't Center City but
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a sort of a residential
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
area of a city um and and I did that
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
along with all the other kids now you
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
know there's I I I think there's some
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
people might say that's you know that's
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
abusive that's uh too much becoming that
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
you you're you're you're letting your
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
child have too much Freedom too
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
young maybe you know this this if this
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment were in effect
 
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it adds some weight to the parents
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
argument that um uh this you know it's
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
my decision to decide whether I'm it you
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
know when my child is old enough to be
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
able to walk to school that's the one
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
example representative long thank you
 
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so to that to that same point would
 
01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.870 align:start position:0%
um so to that to that same point would
educational

01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
educational
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
neglect be the same thing that they
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
would weigh more on the parent
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
as to what the parent senses
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
is the educational capacity of their
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
of I mean to if you're saying would it
 
01:57:10.109 --> 01:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
you know would this Constitutional
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment weigh have a be weighed in the
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
balance if it were if it were in effect
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
yes it would I as I say I don't think
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
that it would that it would mean that
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the sort of Amish culture or
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe some other you know deeply
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
historical religious kind of thing uh I
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
think if you know if if if I just
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
decided you know I want my I want my kid
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to work in the factory at uh at 14
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
years old uh because education isn't
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
very important I would tend to say that
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
the state would have a would have their
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
compulsory uh education laws would would
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
that view on my
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
part okay thank

statement sorry I some bad
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
timing um as we've seen um and heard um
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
regarding other Constitutional Amendment
 
01:58:32.239 --> 01:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
regarding other Constitutional Amendment
um

01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
cacr uh that are coming through um our
 
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um one of the things that
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
I've heard from both sides is that our
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
constituents and our voters find it
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
important so why don't we have them uh
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
give them the ability to vote um and I
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
agree with that and there was a Granite
 
01:59:00.599 --> 01:59:02.350 align:start position:0%
agree with that and there was a Granite
State

01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
poll uh conducted by the University of
 
01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:06.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Survey Center recently
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
that found voters are split on whether
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
they generally support a parents Bill of
 
01:59:11.599 --> 01:59:13.189 align:start position:0%
they generally support a parents Bill of
Rights

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
cacr I I think would fall under this uh
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
poll as well 41 to 39% but amongst
 
01:59:21.629 --> 01:59:21.639 align:start position:0%
parents with children in the household
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
support for the legislation is an
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly 58 to 22% so I think that
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great idea for us to um ask
 
01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.790 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great idea for us to um ask
the

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
voters that if it's important to
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
them and unlike last year when it was a
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
bill this is a cacr the burden of proof
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
or the burden of Passage is much
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
else you representative long thank you
 
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah just with respect to
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
that um Hampshire is not a referendum
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
State um because let the voters vote on
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
every everything we pass here would
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be the scenario
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and now where were those numbers uh
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
something thank you for the question
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
um among parents with children in the
 
02:00:21.239 --> 02:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
um among parents with children in the
household

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
household
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
the number is 58% in favor 22% not in
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
favor um in general the numbers were 49
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
41 to
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
39% was that a poll or it it comes from
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
the granite state poll a states of
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
opinion project conducted by the
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Survey
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
Center okay thank you representative
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman I might be
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
confused and so I ask sincerely what new
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
rights would parents get other than what
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
they already have I just need to know
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what rights that parents don't
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
currently have will this afford them I
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
think you know if we put this on the
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
ballot for parents they're going to be
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
like yeah sure you know I want parental
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
rights okay what new rights is this
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
going to give I need to know that for
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
myself so I stop asking this
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
question representative grman
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
chairman so we're children in family law
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
and of course parents would want a
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
parents' Bill of Rights and all those
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
things but we're charged with protecting
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
children and this cacr does have some
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
issues that could potentially have
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.750 --> 02:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse neglect um
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
so we're here to protect
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
kids and to make
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
sure that that we're protecting them and
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
this cicr has some issues in it that
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
gives parents I think more
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
rights possibly putting children In
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way
 
02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:24.050 align:start position:0%
and representative this is
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:25.709 align:start position:0%
and representative this is
[Music]

02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
not chairman Lynn's statement
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that the statement not
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise serve served means this is not
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
OCA it's debatable it's de debatable
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's and it's exactly yeah okay
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr Mr
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um there's a lot in this and
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's hard to kind of gather the the
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts of all this um the first thing
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
is that children are not property um and
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
and and children do have rights as well
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
and I think the more that we push stuff
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
like this we take that away and and one
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
of their rights is is the right to
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
safety and regardless of what testimony
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
has been that they don't think that this
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
is going to cause a problem you know you
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
have to look at parents and parents that
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
you know um that are that are good
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
parents I know that if my kids are
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
something's happening in school that I
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't like I'm the mama bear and I'm
 
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
going to say you know what no that's
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's my child and let's talk about
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
this um also sometimes I have
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
conversations with my child and say well
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
this is the bigger world so let's have a
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
conversation about how we handle these
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
things there are many many parents
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of people that think that
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't a common or not that think
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
that they're really great parents and
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
they are are in fact abusive as a matter
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
of fact all of the abusive parents that
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
I have spoken with that I have met have
 
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
always said that they're good parents
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to get their kid in
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
line they're just trying to get their
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
kid to be quiet the lack of insight into
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
what is abuse the lack of insight into
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
um what is good
 
02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
parenting is very very interesting I I
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
second representative peto's point that
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
that something like this is just going
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
to embolden the people not that are good
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
parent parents that understand uh that
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
they already have these rights but the
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
parents that that view their children as
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
property that think that they can knock
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
them into next week to get them to
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
listen that kind of stuff so I have high
 
02:04:36.549 --> 02:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
concerns about the safety of children
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the rights of children with
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
something like
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
this representative Damon thank you Mr
 
02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
chair I I
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully and I emphasize
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully um disagree because cuse we
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
already have laws in place that
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
protecting that are protecting the
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
children from the parents
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
who think that they're doing the right
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing but they're actually abusing the
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
children so the laws that protect those
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
children from abuse and neglect will
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
protect the children currently there is
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
very little discussion about the
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
protection of the good parent I'm
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
looking around this room and I'm seeing
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
parents who are good parents and they
 
02:05:37.390 --> 02:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
have zero
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
protection this cacr should go out to
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
our legislative body in each and every
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
city in town and let them decide if they
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
want us as the
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
legislature to make this
 
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
change and give them the good parents
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
the protection that they
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
deserve thank you Mr
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Raymond thank
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm guess I'm I'm wondering what
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
protection good parents need that they
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't have right now I mean currently um
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
um if DCF comes to my door as a parent I
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
can tell them to go away and their only
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
option is to go to court and hope that
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
they have enough evidence based on the
 
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
report to compel me to present my child
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
to them I mean right now there is a
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
high-profile murder
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
case which dcyf unfounded several times
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have that level of
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
evidence in order to move forward right
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
good parents are already protected under
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
the law anytime we create this enabling
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
legislation it doesn't impact those of
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
us who aren't harming our children it
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
only impacts the parents who don't have
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
the best interest of their children in
 
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
their hearts and those parents exist
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
when we talk about parents rights over
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
children's rights we
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
consistently affirm that we don't value
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
the safety and well-being and the rights
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
of children in this state and again I I
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
I noticed that there is a cut out here
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
theoretically and we don't really know
 
02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
until there's a Supreme Court case for
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
physical abuse or killing your kid but
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about neglecting
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
your kid doesn't say anything about
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
being required to provide medical care
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
to your kid when they're ill it doesn't
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
say anything about you know not allowing
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
your child to be um unsupervised at
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
length it doesn't say anything about any
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
of the other laws that we
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
have or guidelines that we have
 
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
requiring parents to meet the needs of
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
their children so under
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
this what we are doing is we are
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
enabling people to have the right to say
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
I can do whatever I want with my child
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
because I own them and we're not
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
allowing the state or our community
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
values on what is appropriate for kids
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
to have sway legally and I worry about
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
that and I I I I'm significantly worried
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
about those kids um especially given
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the office of the child advocate
 
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
report that came out on February I think
 
02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
6th said that there were 29 children
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
under the age of 17 who died in New
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last year 29 kids one was
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
directly attributable to abuse two were
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
homicide several were
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
overdoses right maybe I think it's okay
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
for my 13-year-old to smoke pot and do
 
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
other things does this say that I'm
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that I don't
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
know I don't think we should wait for
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
court cases to find
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
out let me say and I hope also with all
 
02:09:14.189 --> 02:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
due respect I fear the ever
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
encroaching Nanny State you may not know
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
but in Oregon until some time ago it was
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
illegal to have your child in any school
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
other than the public school now I would
 
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
say that is probably anti-roman Catholic
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
bigotry um but nevertheless this is the
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
state saying to parents you cannot have
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
your kid in a parochial school and wow
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
you cannot homeschool your kid and as I
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
watch the polarization across the
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
country I
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
fear ever overarching statism from the
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
left and the right and I'm suggesting
 
02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
left and the right and I'm suggesting
that

02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
this before us is not so much parents
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
versus children as it's parents versus
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
an Ever overarching state so that is why
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
I will be voting for this amendment
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:10:10.679 --> 02:10:12.629 align:start position:0%
anyone else
representative

02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you chairman if we really
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
think that that this is going to protect
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
against abuse because of what we already
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
have before we start looking at
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
something like this that will enable
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
parents that are not good can we look at
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
what our definitions of abuse are and
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
put some more safeguards for children in
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
before we start to do this and give this
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
to parents um that would be much more
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
helpful right now we don't even have an
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
updated definition of abuse in this
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
state representative deimon thank you Mr
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair I'm reading and rereading uh the
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill in I don't see anywhere that it
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
says in this cacr that the parents will
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
own own the child the word's not used
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's number one number
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
two in the past we have heard testimony
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
time and time and time again where if
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
you go to a particular Public elementary
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
middle or high school and ask for
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
educational itinerary you are
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
denied access you are denied there is
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
irrefutable proof about that
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
denial this cacr does not in any way
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
manner or form allow a parent to become
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
a criminal and abuse their child it just
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
gives them a constitutional right to be
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
a parent it gives them the right to go
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
to a courtroom and say I have never
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
abused my child yet I am not allowed
 
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
access to my
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
child this is what it's all about we
 
02:12:01.079 --> 02:12:02.069 align:start position:0%
child this is what it's all about we
have

02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
become a society
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
necessary I might point out on line
 
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
18 parents have the fundamental right
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
and responsibility to direct the
 
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
upbringing education and share their
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
minor children the other bill at least
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
in its original form had the word
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
control among other ways this bill
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
before a 17 is a much softer uh
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
iteration of parental rights than the
 
02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
other one representative
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman along
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
these lines while I was driving in this
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
morning coincidentally on the uh news
 
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
they reported a significant increase in
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
measles among unvaccinated children um
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it's because more and more parents
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
are filing uh religious exemptions
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions for personal philosophy and
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
so forth and um the increase in measles
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh is somewhat alarming and it's uh it's
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
it's rather new uh in a number of
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
decades so I just put that out there
 
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
that individual parents just don't
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
believe in vaccinations and right now we
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
see a significant uh uh uptick therefore
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill became law would it mean
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
that the state could not compel measles
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinations of children and would that
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
be to be
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
feared or put it the other way should we
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
allow the state to
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
compel um numbers of vaccinations of
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
children and that's that's kind of a
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
Crux issue here
 
02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:53.549 align:start position:0%
Crux issue here
representative

02:13:53.549 --> 02:13:53.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you Mr chairman for allowing
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
me to speak
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
um CR CR CR 17
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
um we keep saying that we try to protect
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
kids to be honest this is not protecting
 
02:14:16.030 --> 02:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
kids this is taking away protecting kids
 
02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
I've been saying over and over and over
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
again if someone who was victim when I
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
was little these two bills it will take
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the protection of children's from abuse
 
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.270 align:start position:0%
the protection of children's from abuse
of

02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
parents and I can tell you from the
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
bottom of my heart that i' be 50 years
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
old in like couple days well a week and
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
a half and discards from the abuse when
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
I was five years old until I was 10
 
02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:46.750 align:start position:0%
I was five years old until I was 10
years

02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
old always always going to be on me
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
and every time this conversation comes
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
out about giving more parental rights
 
02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
when the parents already have
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
rights and then people don't have the
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
answers when we ask what other rights
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
parents want when we allow them already
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
to abuse children like
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
myself and I can tell you that I went to
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
a Catholic
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
school and the cathic school cover my
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
dad's abuse against me because he was a
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
big owner for the school to a private
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
school I can tell you that these two
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
bills have nothing good about protecting
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
kids and it's not giving more rights to
 
02:15:33.310 --> 02:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
parents abuser parents probably going to
 
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
give them more rights to continue doing
 
02:15:38.549 --> 02:15:38.559 align:start position:0%
the abuse without have a proper report
 
02:15:38.559 --> 02:15:40.109 align:start position:0%
the abuse without have a proper report
or

02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:15:43.709 --> 02:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
proper way to protect kids so for that
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
reason I will say let's not support
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
these two
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
bills I think we're pretty well circling
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
around and going over the same things
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
again and again is there anything new
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
that anybody wishes to say before we go
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%

02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
where where
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%

with the federal government and with the
 
02:20:22.510 --> 02:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
state government and and I'm not I guess

02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%

problem is this the solution and I'm not
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
