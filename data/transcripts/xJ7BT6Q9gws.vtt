00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
have a stormwater utility it's not for
 
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
any other thing you want to do so it's
 
00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
in the context of that
 
00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to say
 
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to have this grant
 
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
program or
 
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know regulate you
 
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
know this also if you have stormwater
 
00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
utility also regulates runoff of
 
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
pavement and how the nitrogen coming off
 
00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
a parking lot is is going to be dealt
 
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.070 align:start position:0%
a parking lot is is going to be dealt
with

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.429 align:start position:0%
so
that's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
i you know but if you think that that
 
00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified or that's
 
00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 align:start position:0%
problematic then
 
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
you can do amendments too over here
 
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah thank you senator for
 
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i just want to
 
00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 align:start position:0%
confirm that um because of where this is
 
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
in the statute this only applies to
 
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
public water systems or public
 
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
wastewater systems
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
not um individual
 
00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
of private uh homeowners uh thanks for
 
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
your question um
 
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
that actually is it wasn't what it does
 
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.390 align:start position:0%
that actually is it wasn't what it does
do

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
see stormwater utilities are not about
 
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
see stormwater utilities are not about
your

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
public water waste water treatment
 
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
storm water utilities are about all the
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
other sources of nitrogen whether it's
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
runoff from parking lots
 
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
um or or otherwise as i said that's
 
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
about you know about 76 percent of the
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is coming from sources
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise other than
 
00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
waste treatment plants
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a that's why you know communities
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
around the great bay and everybody else
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
under ms4
 
00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
has to get at that so the definition
 
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
has to get at that so the definition
here

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
on 485 a2
 
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is your septic
 
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm describing that you
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
know a community who has a waste
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility now i'll be able to
 
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're going to include
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
septic in this and it might mean that
 
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there's a 10 15 fee
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
on it or if you agree to have your your
 
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
your system inspected you don't pay the
 
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
fee and you are eligible for grant
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
however they want to set it up
 
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
but that's the point here is to
 
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
but that's the point here is to
incorporate

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
those other sources of nitrogen
 
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that it's not
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know they're just trying to not very
 
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
articulated in a particular way saying
 
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
the problem under ms4 is they go after
 
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment plants you can
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
get it up to the limits of science
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
and you're still going to have nitrogen
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
go in the water so epa's going to come
 
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
back so throw another 50 million dollars
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
at it right and that's it's crazy making
 
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's why
 
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
the agreements was struck for the all
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
the great bay region estuaries to say
 
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
total nitrogen permit
 
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
will find ways to go after that other
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and if you see the reduction
 
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
sit you know community wide
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
water system wide
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
then you're not going to come back with
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
a hammer so that's that's that's why
 
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
a hammer so that's that's that's why
this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is to say that if
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
you set up a stormwater utility
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
you can include
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
septic now community might decide we're
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to set this far more community
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
utility but we're not going to accept it
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
we just want to get out the parking lots
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
or the runoff that's going into our
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i could ask for a follow-up okay
 
00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so this in this way
 
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities where their their lake is
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
getting inundated with cyanobacteria
 
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
getting inundated with cyanobacteria
blooms

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
blooms
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
um then they could use this if they had
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
the approval if they followed the rules
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the of the statute of the that would
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
come into place
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
so that sounds good thank you thanks
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
representatives yes yeah
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative creighton
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman senator thank you
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
for your testimony i
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're trying to do
 
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're trying to do
here

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
my question is so what if we don't pass
 
00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.030 align:start position:0%
my question is so what if we don't pass
this

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
they can't i mean if it's enabling then
 
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
they could do it anyway
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that they can't do it
 
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that they can't do it
today

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
today
yeah

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question i believe
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna a stormwater utility is
 
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.869 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna a stormwater utility is
this

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know was in statute we enabled
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities to set those up and to
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
set fees related to them
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
and without the explicit inclusion here
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that is the case
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have a letter from
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
in support of this before you
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i think you're going to hear from
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
the communities as well that we do need
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
if you know we do need to pass this to
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
let them to to fully enable that okay
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
any other question
 
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
any other question
yes

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
i was in the uh
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
we all received it
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.469 align:start position:0%
uh it was
email

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
he was emailed to us
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
but there is someone from des i think is
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking as well
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully you have copies of
 
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully you have copies of
it

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the of his letter if
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
you like her but
 
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
you like her but
if

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
you better
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
we'll work here we'll get we'll get it
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
okay yeah just just yeah they can just
 
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
okay yeah just just yeah they can just
don't

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
we do we definitely now have a copy i i
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
now have two
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right uh any other questions by
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i might before
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
i ask mine
 
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.350 align:start position:0%
i ask mine
uh

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i was wondering
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
in um discussing this
 
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.029 align:start position:0%
in um discussing this
bill

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
putting fertilizer down
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
being an issue is that was that
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
addressed in any way
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question you know i
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
know fertilizer has been discussed in
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
the past and um you know as i said being
 
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.189 align:start position:0%
the past and um you know as i said being
being

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
i call myself a saltwater senator
 
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
i call myself a saltwater senator
because

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
all of us around the great bay the four
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
of us and you know we've been talking
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
about a lot of these issues for many
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
years and i think there's been some
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
fertilizer uh legislation over the years
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
um and dog waste may i say i hear a lot
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
from the folks who are doing
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
aquaculture operations uh in the great
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
bay that that's a concern for them
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
so yes there are other sources of
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
nitrogen um in my research on this uh
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i particularly was reading um from
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
florida and from the um
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh chesapeake bay region they say yeah
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
yeah fertilizer but the percentage of
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
nitrogen that's coming from fertilizer
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
is far far less
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
than this
 
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.469 align:start position:0%
than this
so

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
and this makes more practical sense in a
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
way than trying to get at and you know
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
the fertilizer regulation you know
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with these national
 
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.510 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with these national
corporations

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
who are formulating this they and
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
they've changed their formulation some
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
huh um to make it more long-lasting in
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the nitrogen and and
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
that but um you know i i i think that
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
opens up
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
such a can of worms that this this seems
 
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
such a can of worms that this this seems
practical

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative harp for a question thank
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question a
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up to
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith if this bill
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
would affect private septic systems the
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
town could implement in the enabling
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislation a fee
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
on all private systems whether they're
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
contaminating setting off nitrogen or
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
anything just like an assessment for
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
everybody in town could they do that
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know i uh
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
i i tend to trust our towns and um
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
to think that
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know we have legislative bodies and
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
if ideas come forward
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
um they have to get people to vote for
 
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
um they have to get people to vote for
it

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
um my feeling is from seeing the way
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
these have been done
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
in other municipalities that they tend
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
to have very strong support
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
because people are interested in
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the environment which is
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons they probably moved
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
into that town in the first place
 
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
into that town in the first place
um

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
stays the way it is and and and
 
00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
stays the way it is and and and
flourishes

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
flourishes
 
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.389 align:start position:0%
flourishes
um

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
i i understand and i share with you the
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
kind of anxieties over taxation and fees
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know i i mean i'm i'm new hampshire
 
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
you know i i mean i'm i'm new hampshire
too

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's no intent from
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
the communities i've heard from that the
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
point here is to encourage folks and to
 
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.389 align:start position:0%
point here is to encourage folks and to
provide

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
funding for improvement
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
of septic systems so that nitrogen
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
overall is controlled
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
and i think it is fair enough
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
to look at contributors to nitrogen i
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
mean that's why you know planning
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
departments now if somebody's going to
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
a supermarket and they're going to have
 
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.310 align:start position:0%
a supermarket and they're going to have
a

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
parking lot what do they do they require
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
the planning department require some
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
water garden or you know how you're
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to deal with the runoff there so
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just you know going into our
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
our lakes and streams so in a way it's
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a user
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a user orientation that if
 
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.829 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a user orientation that if
you're

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
one of the if you're contributing the
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
nitrogen that is creating for us a
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
problem under ms4 then you can
 
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.230 align:start position:0%
problem under ms4 then you can
participate

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
in the solution that's one of the
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
reasons i pointed to the program down
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know the bay restoration which is
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
all you know the states around
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
chesapeake bay
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
where they said they identify in that
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
process those things that are in the
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
critical area so that they would know
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
that the groundwater there yeah that's
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
going to go into the bay
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
if you're not in that critical area and
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think for them it's like within a
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
thousand feet or something like that i
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
don't know i mean it depends on the
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
ecology and the groundwater flows and so
 
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
ecology and the groundwater flows and so
on

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
then you're not covered by it so i'm i'm
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
hoping that that's the kind of
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach that our
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
i'm used to dealing with massachusetts
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and title v
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
with this enabling legislation my
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
concern is a municipality as kind as
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
they might want to be
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
they could probably implement or my
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
question is could they implement a local
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
ordinance that says any sale of any
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
property needs to have a the system
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
examined and if you fail you need to
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
upgrade it and they don't have to grant
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
them a grant to do it could they do that
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
under this legislation well thanks for
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
your question and i you know i'm i think
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to have ted dears up with us
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
but i and i'm i make and the realtors
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know but i think it's the case that
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
when there is a sale of a property now
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
you that's the that's the time at which
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
their inspection takes place
 
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
their inspection takes place
no

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
not statutorily
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is a bill that we are looking we
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh is on
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we are you know have retained
 
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
that we are you know have retained
well

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
here's where we're at okay
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
epa ms4
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
is coming at us right and um i feel that
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
our having something in our toolbox so
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
that we can locally decide out
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
right i mean once federal regulation
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
comes down there's not a lot of fine
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
grade about that it's it it's a hammer
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
ton of bricks what you want to call it
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i mean we've been through that the
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
great around the great bay and i think
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to see more of it under ms4
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know this to me seems like a
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
practical solution though look i share
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
your concerns okay i
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know i my private property is
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
private property and
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
being able to sell it and you know the
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
real estate market
 
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.829 align:start position:0%
real estate market
uh

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
people like transparency clarity and not
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
anxiety about it so
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
i get it
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
take my question and send out my
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions first of all
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
what is there any urgency on this uh
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the federal government and
 
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.470 align:start position:0%
relative to the federal government and
you know

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
i know they threaten all the time
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for coming there's extreme
 
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.230 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for coming there's extreme
urgency

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
urgency
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
around the great bay area
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i think we're going to see extreme
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
urgency in other ms4 communities a
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
consent agreement was signed by those
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
communities around the great bay
 
00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
communities around the great bay
after

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
years of
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
negotiation and then up right walking
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
right up to the line
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
of threatened legal action by the epa
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
which in which the consequences and the
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars that
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
would have had been expense
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
would have been extreme impact on the
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and businesses who might have
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
just moved out of the area rather than
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
deal with the increase in water
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
treatment fees so i would say and i
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
think you'll hear from
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
from dover and elsewhere i mean that's
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
why they're starting to make the move
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
now towards stormwater utilities is
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
because they've been given this
 
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
because they've been given this
opportunity

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with nitrogen
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
on a community-based way and find our
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
own solutions
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we have we are on a deadline
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh another another question um
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
storm water utility storm water is
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
surface water
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.550 align:start position:0%
surface water
uh

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
septic systems is a subsurface water is
 
00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
septic systems is a subsurface water is
the

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
drain do the drains uh surface water
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
drainage systems do they cat do they
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
capture anything
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
leachate that might be uh
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the question and of
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
course you're right um you know storm
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
water uh runs off of of uh parking lots
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
it also gets into storm drains and
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
leaf litter gets in there and you know
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of programs now to clean
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
those out but groundwater also gets into
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
our lakes and rivers and into the great
 
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
our lakes and rivers and into the great
bay

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
bay
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that's that that that's that's the
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
point of this is that it all nitrogen
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
ends up going somewhere and that's
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
what is causing the impairment of the
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
waters and why
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
the epa says you've got to deal with the
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's the nitrogen however it gets there
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's the nitrogen right but i i bet i
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
realize it's the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
question that
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
but treating the drainage
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
what's in the what's in what's in the
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
street drains
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
how much nitrogen is in there
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
gets into the water table or what just
 
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
gets into the water table or what just
simply

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh goes subsurface to the to the to the
 
00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.310 align:start position:0%
uh goes subsurface to the to the to the
uh

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the river system
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh in other words are you treating a
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
whole lot of water that doesn't have any
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
nitrogen in it to begin with
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a question for the des
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
person yeah do ask that but i would just
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
say i mean again i know my community
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and that one of the things
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of creative people working
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
for our communities on storm water and
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
on nitrogen
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
and uh there is a
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
a storm drain
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
um program in dover where you know to
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
clean them out and to put in new kinds
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
of drains that make sure that the leaf
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
litter and other other sources of dog
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
waste you name it all those other
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
sources of nitrogen don't get into the
 
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
sources of nitrogen don't get into the
um

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
into the system so it comes from it
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
comes from a lot of different sources it
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
can depend on the community
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of what percentages come
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
from each but uh that's what a
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility lets you do is it
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
lets you figure out for your community
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from and how can you
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh just one
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
one additional maybe it's a comment
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe something i should talk to the des
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
person about
 
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:52.150 align:start position:0%
person about
but

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
i've always uh you know as long as i've
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
been here and and even in previous lives
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
you you never put storm water or surface
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
water into the septic system because you
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
hurt the septic system
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
and is that a
 
00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
and is that a
still

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the interior knowledge is that still
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
the general
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
the the general rule of thumb because
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
you can give
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
i would hate to see us
 
00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.230 align:start position:0%
i would hate to see us
now

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
getting into another problem where your
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
the septic or your sewage systems start
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
failing because of too much water
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
entering them
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman i don't i
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what this is about um
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
i think it's just saying that you know
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
the nitrogen is coming out of septic
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
systems you can you can look at in your
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
storm water utility it's not meaning
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the storm water is going to be put
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
into the septic systems or
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
or vice versa it's just it's just saying
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
you've got all these sources of nitrogen
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
and how can you figure out how to reduce
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the nitrogen in them
 
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
reduce the nitrogen in them
okay

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh anything more from the uh
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
any questions come up afterwards you
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
i like your notebook
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
i want to call
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%

the administrator of the wastewater
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
engineering bureau
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to testify
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
on sb 257
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
and if you don't mind i would like to
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
also call up ted dears from new

hampshire d s who's the administrator of
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to tag team this one it
 
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
we're going to tag team this one it
actually

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
covers both of our bureaus to a certain
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
extent so and you'll probably
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
submit a car or a big card after you're
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
finished no no no finish finish off all
 
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
finished no no no finish finish off all
right

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
so well i'll start um on our last letter
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
of testimony that you have received i
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
would just like to say on the first page
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the bill says the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
language there is as proposed we did not
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
amend the language on that first page
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
for the amended language
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you today but
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
i will say that despite that ds is in
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
favor of the amended language as it is
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i tried to listen senator waters did
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
an amazing job giving you the background
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
and answering all the questions i'm
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to try to to hit on our highlights
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
excuse me could you move the mic over so
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
you can speak
 
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
you can speak
sure

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
so just as senator waters said you know
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
this gives the municipalities the
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to enact
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation it does not require
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
them to do so
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.549 align:start position:0%
this legislation
is

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of communities that are here
 
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.669 align:start position:0%
coming out of communities that are here
today

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
that are under regulatory scrutiny
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
you've heard ms4 you've heard great bait
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
total nitrogen general permit
 
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
total nitrogen general permit
um

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
and these communities um that are
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
subject to the these
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
these regulatory requirements as we all
 
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
these regulatory requirements as we all
know

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
um federal regulations never get less
 
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.909 align:start position:0%
um federal regulations never get less
stringent

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
stringent
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
they only get more stringent and they
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
get broader over time so one of the
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
things that the amended language did
 
00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.270 align:start position:0%
things that the amended language did
which

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
as senator waters stated took out
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
subject to federal storm water
 
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
subject to federal storm water
regulations

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
was a good thing because this will in
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
the future allow
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
coverage as epa expands its areas of
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
coverage for for the ms4 and or just
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
there was a statement about all plans or
 
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
there was a statement about all plans or
proposals

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
um we feel that this is very important
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
this p this piece here was added um all
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
plans are proposals submitted by a
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility to the legislative
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
body of municipality for approval
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
shall include at least one estimate of
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of the plan prepared by a
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
professional entity engaged in storm
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
water mitigation or sewage treatment and
 
00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
water mitigation or sewage treatment and
disposal

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and why this is important if you're
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to create a utility
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
you have to know how you're going to
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
create it right you have to know the
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
costs what are you what are you trying
 
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
costs what are you what are you trying
to

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
to
to

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
to treat or to to do what are you trying
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what are your goals
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
and then what are the costs to
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
accomplish those goals so your goals are
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
going to come out of your federal
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and so you need to have
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
that clearly established before you go
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
in front of the community and say
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
you can't just go in there and say we
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to create a stormwater utility you
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
have to have that plan or proposal to do
 
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.310 align:start position:0%
have to have that plan or proposal to do
that

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to say there's
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
never a better time to to to create that
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
because with all the srf dollars that
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
are out there
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
under the clean water srf program
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
such a plan would be
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
um eligible for our current hundred
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars planning grants
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
so that that that plan or proposal could
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
be at no cost to the the community if
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
um someone had mentioned um
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know does this does this do
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
communities already have the authority
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
to create such utility
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
and what we've been hearing from the
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
different communities it's just fuzzy it
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
seems like some feel that they could
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
have the authority and others feel that
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
they couldn't so what this bill would do
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
would would be to solidify that for
 
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
would would be to solidify that for
everybody

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then there was a lot of discussions
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
about a fee to be able to be charged to
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
basically

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes they could
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
but that would have to be in that
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
planner proposal right to
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
and that would be putting forth uh in
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
front of the townspeople to be able to
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
create that utility so you just can't
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
randomly start charging people's fees
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
but i would also like to say that you
 
00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:11.350 align:start position:0%
but i would also like to say that you
know

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
proper septic tank maintenance requires
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
them to be pumped on a regular basis and
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
we recommend every three to five years
 
00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
we recommend every three to five years
so

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that has to go somewhere and that
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
has to go to a municipal wastewater
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
treatment facility
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
right now the septic fees i don't know
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
how many people have private septic
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
systems are on a community municipal
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
system i've been on both so i've seen
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
but it's a minimal fee to pump your tank
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
and take it to a wastewater treatment
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
facility for treatment
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's only a couple hundred dollars and
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
you only have to do it every three to
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
now that i am on a municipal system i
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
think i pay over eight hundred dollars a
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
year for my sewage fee only
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it's quite a different cost
 
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.149 align:start position:0%
so it's it's quite a different cost
differential

00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
differential
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
and why i'm bringing that up because at
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
any time the wastewater treatment
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
facilities could decide to increase that
 
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.070 align:start position:0%
facilities could decide to increase that
fee

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
but they haven't
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
and there's pros and cons to that
 
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
and there's pros and cons to that
so

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
if they increase their fee for septage
 
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.669 align:start position:0%
if they increase their fee for septage
pumping

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
pumping
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh in delivery to the treatment plant
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
would that now
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
would people think about it would they
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
delay their treat pumping would they
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
delay that that maintenance that's so
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
vital to the proper operation of that
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i think they would you know if it if
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
you go from 300 to a thousand dollars to
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
pump your tank a lot of people are going
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
to forgo that or they're going to put it
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
off because it's an increase in cost so
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's a very important piece they
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
already have that ability to increase
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
that cost but if they did how many
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
people would delay pumping and then what
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
environmental issues would come out of
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
that how many people would have failed
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.549 align:start position:0%
 
also

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
because septage has to go to municipal
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities everyone
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
bears that responsibility for those
 
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.190 align:start position:0%
bears that responsibility for those
costs

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
so typically for wastewater treatment
 
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.269 align:start position:0%
so typically for wastewater treatment
facilities

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
you have your users and most
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities are set up to just charge
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
the the people that are directly
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
utilizing the wastewater treatment
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
facility they have a direct pipe to it
 
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.549 align:start position:0%
facility they have a direct pipe to it
so

00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
they're not including the private
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
systems so that's why you there's that
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
disparity that huge disparity in what i
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
pay as a municipal user versus what i
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
paid when i had a private septic system
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
so how do we account for that disparity
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
but back to the main points is that
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation this gives
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
the municipalities the ability to create
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
a utility if they need to
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
the costs are the cost the federal
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
regulations have requirements and the
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to abide by those
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
requirements so this
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
enables them to be able to manage those
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
costs in a way that works for their
 
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.510 align:start position:0%
costs in a way that works for their
community

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
and every community may have slightly
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
you know different circumstances
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
that plan or proposal that they would
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
create to put in front of their
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
townspeople is very important so that
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
the transparency and the the townspeople
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
would know exactly what they're doing
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that's all i can read from
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
my scribble so
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
mr dears do you have uh anything you
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:53.590 align:start position:0%
want to
add

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
um i'll just maybe answer a couple of
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up in the
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony um so there was a
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
question from i believe from the chair
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh about what's the percentages of
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
different sources of nitrogen into the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
estuary and it's interesting um
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's about uh if you take out the the
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
point sources which are those wastewater
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
treatment plants which are about 30
 
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.389 align:start position:0%
treatment plants which are about 30
percent

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
so you have 70 percent left
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
and if you cut that then into chunks
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.149 align:start position:0%
and if you cut that then into chunks
uh

00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh septic systems are about 40
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
so it is the largest chunk of the rest
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
of the of the the nitrogen sources
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
storm water
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
which is made up of lots of other things
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
storm water is made up of both
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizers somebody asked the question
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
about fertilizers fertilizers end up in
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
storm water
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
as well as atmospheric deposition so we
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
are down as you all i'm sure are well
 
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.549 align:start position:0%
are down as you all i'm sure are well
aware

00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the tailpipe of the
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
nation when it comes to air quality and
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
so all of the noxas and soxes which are
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
not a dr seuss book
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
but are contaminants in our air
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
that those end up in our air and they
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
actually fall to the ground they're
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
scavenged by snow or they fall as as
 
00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:10.630 align:start position:0%
scavenged by snow or they fall as as
precipitate

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
precipitate
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
so those end up on the surfaces and
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
those get washed off in storm water all
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
of that together is somewhere around 30
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
of that you know that that non-point
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
source load the loads that come from
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
lots of different sources so certainly
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
lawns uh in in the great bay watershed
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's about 43 000 acres of lawns it
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
is by far this largest component of
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
agriculture if you want to call it that
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's a significant component as
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
well as things like animal um you know
 
00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.389 align:start position:0%
well as things like animal um you know
waste

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that is from domestic animals
 
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
that is from domestic animals
and

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
as well as fertilizers that go on
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural crops but those are very
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
small components so
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes the the answer the fact of the
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
matter is is that humans uh discharge uh
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the order i think the senator said
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
something like 40 pounds a year uh per
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
perceptic system was an estimate down in
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
maryland we've estimated that each
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
human's about seven pounds a year we
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
emit uh in terms of our nitrogen
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i think that answered that question
 
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.269 align:start position:0%
so i think that answered that question
um

00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
trying to recall
 
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.549 align:start position:0%
trying to recall
the

00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
other questions that came up
 
00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.990 align:start position:0%
other questions that came up
um

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
but i think some of this some of what i
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
think will be helpful to you is to kind
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
of hear how one of these things would
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
work in the context of a real discussion
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
going on in a real community
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so there are some folks that are
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
sitting behind us who are those doers on
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
who who i think can speak to some of the
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
practical matters of how this would
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
right so so i i guess this is
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
bears also just a sort of a science
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
piece of this is that
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
septic systems are pretty good at
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
getting phosphorus out of the
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
of wastewater because phosphorus absorbs
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
onto other things it sticks to other
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
things so when it gets stuck pumped out
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're pumping out a lot of that
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and when it goes into your
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
leach field most of that phosphorus gets
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
soaked up or it gets attached
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
into yourself into your leach field
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is a very different matter
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
nitrogen becomes dissolved and what a
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
septic system does really well is take
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
things that are dissolved and put them
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
into the groundwater
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
that is what's meant to do
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
in some ways you can think of a septic
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
system as the perfect dissolved nitrogen
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
discharge system into groundwater it
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
does it extremely effectively and it
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
very little treatment because it's
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
anaerobic within the the soils in your
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
septic system so you get very little
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
treatment of nitrogen as it goes through
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
the system this is why
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
as we start to talk about this issue it
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
becomes kind it becomes an interesting
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
one and one in which why it becomes
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and one it one way
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
one reason why it might make sense to
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
have a stormwater utility that includes
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
a wastewater utility that includes
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
septic systems is because you could
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
include some of those more expensive
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
systems so that the cost would not be
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
borne by the the homeowner necessarily
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
it could be spread out you could get
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
grants you could go to tracy's program
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
which by the way has lots and lots and
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
lots of money right now for srf grants
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure and we'll have more
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
over the next five years
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
so so there's an opportunity here to be
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
able to attack some of these very
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
expensive and very difficult issues in
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
this manner that would allow for this to
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
happen in a way that would not affect
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
the homeowner nearly to the extent that
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
it otherwise might if you didn't have
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
this kind of mechanism available to a
 
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
this kind of mechanism available to a
community

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
i think i can stop there and we can see
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much as always for your
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
senator grassley mentioned the
 
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.710 align:start position:0%
senator grassley mentioned the
fines

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
fines
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
potential fine from the epa
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh are those imminent and and what's the
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude of that and and would this
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislation help us
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
avoid those fines
 
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.789 align:start position:0%
avoid those fines
so

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
the the way that permits work is you
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
have to kind of meet your permit
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that there are fines
 
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that there are fines
imminent

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
imminent
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is the long-term
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of how you're going to
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
meet the nitrogen reductions within your
 
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.389 align:start position:0%
meet the nitrogen reductions within your
permit

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that there are these people
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
here behind us that can probably speak
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
to that better
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
they're looking ahead five years
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
so if you start looking ahead five years
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
you can get to certain reductions fairly
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
easily as you get further down the road
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
those become harder and harder so the
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
real question is is what happens five
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
years from now in the next permit and
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
how are you prepared for that and how
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
are you addressing the kinds of sources
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know that you can get to for the
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
lowest dollar possible you want to hit
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
the lowest the lowest cost the lowest
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
marginal cost per unit of nitrogen
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
i took economics a lot in college so
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's that that is that is the whole idea
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
here and that's why this legislation is
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
out there is to be allowed the
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to attack that
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
lowest cost piece of nitrogen or
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
phosphorus whatever it is that you're
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do in your particular
 
00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do in your particular
community

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
on the enforcement piece
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
the goal of epa is not to issue fines
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have communities do the
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
work that they need to do and accomplish
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
that so they would only
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
save the fines for those communities
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
that aren't working or making progress
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
towards the goals of the permits because
 
00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
towards the goals of the permits because
it's

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's futile to spend money on fines they
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
want communities to spend the moneys on
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the goals and improving
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
the water quality in great bay and other
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
areas in our state
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh one you very much for your testimony
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
i just a couple quick questions
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
um could you tell me the name of the
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
grants and
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh just for point of clarification
 
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0%
uh just for point of clarification
so

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
could mitigate nitrogen
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know treatment plants coming to
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
their treatment plants
 
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
their treatment plants
if

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
could they do this theoretically test
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
the sewage that's coming in for nitrogen
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then say
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know you're you've got
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know so many parts per million so
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge you an extra fee
 
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge you an extra fee
um

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
and also like that would be a way of
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
educating the public to
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know here here are some ways that
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
you can mitigate your nitrogen
 
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.190 align:start position:0%
you can mitigate your nitrogen
um

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
is by you know not fertilizing your lawn
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
for instance as as often um
 
00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:14.470 align:start position:0%
for instance as as often um
but

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
so that would be would that be one way
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
to do it that's a question
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess i should just stop there
 
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.349 align:start position:0%
and i guess i should just stop there
because

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
there's too many questions
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
would that be one feasible way i guess
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then the name of the grants
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay so um the grants or uh the loans
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
that we give with subsidy 100 subsidy is
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the clean water state revolving fund
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we're offering um a hundred thousand
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
dollar planning grants
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we're actually going to be
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
soliciting for projects our annual
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
process is about to get underway so by
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
friday we should have our solicitation
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
out and then we have communities can
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
submit pre-applications
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the septic piece this the septic
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
systems as ted stated
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
are not designed to treat for nitrogen
 
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.349 align:start position:0%
are not designed to treat for nitrogen
so

00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're go
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
when you pump your tank they know
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
they're bringing the nitrogen to the
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
treatment plant so you're saying charge
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
a fee based on the amount of nitrogen in
 
00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
a fee based on the amount of nitrogen in
that

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
um well do they test um could would it
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
be feasible i guess to test every
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
be feasible i guess to test every
um

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
input you know every uh deposit to the
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
the sewage system and then that way they
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
could educate the
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh to maybe prevent the nitrogen in the
 
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.109 align:start position:0%
uh to maybe prevent the nitrogen in the
future

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i think the way that could be
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
accomplished it would not
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
be feasible to test every
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
theft itch load pumped um pollers you
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
know how they can they can pump several
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
systems and then they're gonna take that
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
combined load go to the treatment plant
 
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
combined load go to the treatment plant
um

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
but they could do a quick test i'm
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud here i'm sorry they
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
could do a quick test i think the way to
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish that would be to
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
you know just having a general knowledge
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
of what
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
type amount of nitrogen comes out of
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
there are other constituents in our
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
septic tanks beyond nitrogen um we have
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of copper you know we have copper
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
in our in our houses and there's copper
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
and our septage and amongst other things
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
so nitrogen's actually not the only
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
and ted go ahead yes yeah i think what
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're raising is exactly the point of
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
why someone would create a utility
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay so this is this is exactly how a
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
storm water utility works and i think
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
gretchen young from dover is going to
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little bit
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
you would have a certain amount of of
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
property that has a certain about
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
ability to generate
 
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
ability to generate
pollution

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
whether it be fertilizers or whether it
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
be your your amount of imperviousness or
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
the other things going on on your
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
property so let's say that you're
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
connected into the stormwater system
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is stormwater side not septic side
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
septic site is different but the
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
stormwater side would do exactly what
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is that there's a
 
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is that there's a
metric

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
metric
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
of how much pollution you're creating
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
from your particular property and then
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
the utility is then bases its fee on
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
that metric
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
and how you get that metric how you get
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
that fee to go down
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
is by changing your behavior on that
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
particular piece of property so that
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
creates the financial incentive for
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
people to reduce their pollution which
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
is why a storm water utility works to
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually reduce storm water
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
pollutants over time it also generates
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
the dollars necessary to do centralized
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
treatment of some of that kind of stuff
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be you know storm drains or
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
improvements or you know kind of
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
infiltration basins green infrastructure
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
generally which is also fundable through
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
our srf program i never forget um so so
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
anyway that's kind of the subject
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
system's a little harder
 
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.829 align:start position:0%
system's a little harder
we

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of ways for us to
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
change that behavior of ourselves um
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
with exception those of you who remember
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh the folks talking over in over in
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
burlington um talking about urine
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
diversion i don't know if you remember
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
that conversation i think that actually
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
came up in this body a couple of times
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
in which if you actually divert urine
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
which has primary which has most of the
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is actually in urine and not in
 
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is actually in urine and not in
feces

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
feces
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
sorry just have to put it out there um
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that by collecting that using it for
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizer you actually kill two birds
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
with one stone but that's a little more
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
radical than i think most humans are
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
ready for
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
anyone else
questions

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
i do want to thank senator waters for
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill up i understand that
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
the ms4 and nitrogen in general is a
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
complicated issue i think where our
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
concerns lie
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
is uh the very
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
very portion of the bill that creates a
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
a public utility that is very broad and
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
open-ended relative to what the
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities can and cannot do
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
so if passed sb 257 would for the first
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
time make privately owned septic systems
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
become part of a public utility
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is a significant step for new
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and could have implications
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
further down the road
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
by making private septics part of a
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
public utility this legislation would
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
potentially allow municipalities to
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
mandate upgrades
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
new systems or property owners and fees
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any guard rails in
 
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any guard rails in
this

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that talks about what those
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
fees and those
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
inspections and those timelines might
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
look for
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
so for example on the fee side of the
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
house the current statute rsa 149 i 6
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
hyphen d
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
does have a fee for calculating excuse
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
me has a formula for calculating fees
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
that formula is relative to impervious
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
surface on a subject properties lot
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
which makes sense in the context of
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
stormwater runoff but not in the context
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
of a private septic system
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
so what would be the fees imposed we
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't know and i think as senator waters
 
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.589 align:start position:0%
don't know and i think as senator waters
raised

00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is our concern and again we
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand and respect the reasons for
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation but it's are those
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
unknowns that are concerning us for our
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh for our uh private property owners
 
00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
uh for our uh private property owners
um

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
one bullet point according to our
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
research and curious what the des would
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
say nearly one half
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residential properties
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
are serviced by septic systems and
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of realtors
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
participated in the shoreland septic
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
system study commission established by
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 475.
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
the ideas of fees on private septic
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
systems were not part of that
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the commission and nor
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
do we think fees were ever discussed at
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and our concern goes to these fees and
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
also what the mandates from the
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
individual municipalities may be
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
not all septic systems are potential
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
threats to increasing nitrogen loads
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
the currently as the des suggested
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
recommends pumping every three to five
 
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.829 align:start position:0%
recommends pumping every three to five
years

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
a new properly well maintained is not
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
the same as a failed system and this
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill does not distinguish between the
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
two and leaves that decision entirely in
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
the hands of the municipality
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
nhar would hope that the state would
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
look at the significant dollars
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
available through the federal
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill before looking to
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
add new costs and new fees to private
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation which requires a great
 
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.829 align:start position:0%
this legislation which requires a great
deal

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
more discussion in the new hampshire
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
association of realtors are prepared to
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
be part of those discussions but we ask
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
you not to pass sb 257 and i thank you
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um when uh the
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill testified he said
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
that when the bill first as it was
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
introduced only covered the great bay
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
area pretty much
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
um the town's affected by the msr
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
permitting process through epa
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
and so would you have less would the
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
realtors have less
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
problem if the bill was amended back to
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
its original state so it only covered
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
those municipalities affected by the
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
federal mandate
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
the opening of a public utility
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
um at a municipal level without
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
what the municipality's
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
power is
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
their amount of the fees and what the
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
either the testing
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
or the requirements and penalties that
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
they could impose on a private property
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
owner those are our concerns uh the
 
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
owner those are our concerns uh the
geographic

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
geographic
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
the number of municipalities
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
i i believe that would be part of it
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative smith but it's really the
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
the unknown part that is created by this
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that is the broader
 
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that is the broader
concern

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
did you submit any kind of
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
write-up of your
 
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.230 align:start position:0%
write-up of your
testimony

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
no representative i did not but happy to
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
send something to you
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're all getting older
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the alternative is what you
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
don't want
um

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
let's see i have two people from dover
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
are you doing this they're this together
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
are you doing it separately
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh i can
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
but ever
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'll give your choices because
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's best to you play off one
 
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.950 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's best to you play off one
another

00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh this uh dennis uh

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
guess the municipal alliance for
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
adaptive management yes exactly right
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and the floor is
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
yours however you wish to break it up
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
and you can don't worry we'll wing it
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
but i'll start with some preliminary
 
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
but i'll start with some preliminary
yeah

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%

00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
the citizen committee that recently
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
adopted a proposal and provided it to
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
the city council to establish a
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility uh dover i think is
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit ahead of most of
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
the other cities in the state although i
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
think your host city concord is is
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
pretty close and portsmouth i know is is
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
working on that so this was a diverse
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh very well selected
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
individuals from all from all areas from
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
business owners uh property owners
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
engineers uh technical folks the dover
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
city council accepted the committee's
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
report and our process is designed to to
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
make it thoughtful
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
well planned out
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
at this point with the acceptance of the
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
report we have tasked our city manager
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh to begin
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning the details that need to
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
come along a lot of the details have
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
discussed been discussed a little bit
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
this morning uh our expectation is by
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
the end of next year there'll be a
 
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.549 align:start position:0%
the end of next year there'll be a
proposal

00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
for the affirmation of an ordinance that
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
will establish the utility and then
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
begin uh utility operations uh the first
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
of uh fiscal year 25 july 1st 2024. uh
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we are we're being careful cautious
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're taking our time uh and watching
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
things like this that may have an effect
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
so as you've heard there
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
among 12 other communities in the
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
watershed we recently received our great
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
bay nitrogen uh general total nitrogen
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
general permit
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
as gretchen will speak to is that the
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
part three of this permit establishes
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
the development of adapted management
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
framework to continue to iterately
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
improve the water quality in great bay
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
this uh this came after as you heard
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
from senator waters after an extended
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
period of negotiations discussions uh
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
with the uscpa des conservation law
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
foundation uh and
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
we felt that we really got to uh the
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
place everyone needed to be with the the
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
development of this adapted management
 
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
development of this adapted management
framework

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
framework
 
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.270 align:start position:0%
framework
so

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
the alliance understands that the
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
efforts to restrict contaminants can't
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
be exclusive to the wastewater treatment
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
plant you've heard the numbers kicked
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
around about uh the split between point
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
sources non-point sources and then
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
within the non-point sources the split
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
with septic and and other sources that's
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
well understood uh in the permit and in
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
fact if you look at
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
the several pages of uh actions for for
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to look at there are lots
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
of efforts to take on including things
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
like nitrogen for high nitrogen
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
fertilizer reduction if at all possible
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
the use of organic treatments
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
one of my other uh
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
tasks that i did when i was uh early in
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
the council is that i had a resolution
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
pass that limited fertilizer use in the
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
city of dover on publicly owned lands to
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
just those that contain low nitrogen
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
organic type fertilizers so we are
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
trying to take this on
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
at a number of different fla in
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
different fronts
 
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
different fronts
so

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.670 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
the committee really had two
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
foundational principles that they were
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
working on in determining whether or not
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
to go ahead with the utility because the
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee was to choose
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
a funding alternative do you do you fund
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
it with the general fund basically
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes do you fund it with
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
individualized type district locations
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
do you find it with a utility do you
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
fund it with public private partnerships
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
and ultimately we really came down this
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
to really two choices there's a utility
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's using property taxes out of the
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
general fund because you're always going
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
to rely on public property uh
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
public-private partnerships to to
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish things you've got to work
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
with developers to make to make it come
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
out right and you're always going to
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
work to get as many of the the grants uh
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
that you can and listening to def
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
testimony was going to start writing
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
some stuff because this sounds like this
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
now we have we recognize the state's
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
been very supportive of this and look
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
forward to working with them so the two
 
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.950 align:start position:0%
forward to working with them so the two
foundational

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
foundational
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
aspects were one
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
build in equitable equitability in the
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
the charges associated with dealing with
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
storm water
 
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.309 align:start position:0%
storm water
costs

00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
the amount that you pay towards
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
storm water mitigation water
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
improvements is based on the value of
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
your property
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
so that the amount you pay towards storm
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
water could increase if you put a new
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
floor in your kitchen if you add a
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
bathroom to your upstairs that doesn't
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
seem to be well tuned it really should
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
be based on your contribution to the
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
effort uh
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
the need for the effort to to reduce
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
stormwater contaminants and to better
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
manage it which is done by a
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
the selection of the
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent residential unit for
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
impermeability on your property
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
so in dover the average single family
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
house has about a 3 400 square foot area
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
of impermeable surface you drive away
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
your roof maybe your patio
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
and this is all captured by satellite
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
images put into a gis system and has
 
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
images put into a gis system and has
been

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
reasonably well documented
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
and from that to support a three and a
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
half million dollar a year expected cost
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
for storm water management that comes
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
down to about 128 dollars per single
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
family residence
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're a larger business
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
particularly a business with a large
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot your share is going to be
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
bigger because you're contributing more
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
contaminants into the system so the
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee's determination was about
 
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.150 align:start position:0%
committee's determination was about
equity

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
equity
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
and they found a utility to be more
 
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
and they found a utility to be more
equitable

00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
but as importantly and it really was a
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
50 50 split that the other piece is to
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
improve water quality period
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
if we can't improve water quality with
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
the utility or any of our efforts
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
then we're wasting time we're wasting
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
money it really has to be the drive
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
behind the city with the citizens behind
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
us to improve the quality of the water
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
that ultimately ends up uh in the great
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
bay estuary
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
on its way to the great bay it also goes
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
through the eisenglass the coachico the
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
bellamy where we swim we fish we boat so
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
water quality improving the rivers it is
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
also just as important
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
so looking at septic systems it really
 
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
so looking at septic systems it really
is

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious that you need to include
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
that as part of this effort
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
and more importantly and has been talked
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
about this morning
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
the words option flexibility and
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
enablement are part of it because that's
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
how this state works you you enable a
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
city like dover to be able to build that
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
into its systems so stepping back into
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
my role as deputy mayor and thinking
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
 
dover

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
dover
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
is is not likely at all
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
to mandate inspections
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're not likely to get involved in the
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
transaction of a piece of property as
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
part of a stormwater initiative
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
what are we likely to do
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
and this is similar to how we're going
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
to build the rest of our stormwater
 
00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
to build the rest of our stormwater
utility

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to set a fee tell the
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
individual property owner this is the
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
amount that you owe
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
and then that property owner can say
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
well can you take a look at this
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
i have two rain gardens i have an
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
underwater gravel watershed
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
i have this other
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
base best management practice built into
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
my property
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
and our system is going to have the
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
required credit system and you can back
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
off from that fee
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
one of those credits could very well be
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
hey i can show i've been pumping my
 
00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
hey i can show i've been pumping my
system

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll get a credit for that maybe i
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
can show that while they're pumping it
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
this qualified inspector has taken a
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
look and said yep yours is in good shape
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
that could result in a credit
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
and also when there is a failure when
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
there is a problem possibly the utility
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
could build reserve funds and help that
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
homeowner out
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're going through a problem
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
in a corner of our city right now where
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
a pretty good sized neighborhood with a
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
common uh sewer system had a complete
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
failure and i i believe it had to do
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the way that was installed the
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
contractor put it in poorly but the city
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
responded and said well the best way to
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
deal with this
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
is to get septic out to that
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
out to that neighborhood it's going to
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the contaminants that were coming
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
out these poor folks had to have their
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
tanks pumped every third day just to try
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and get by and be able to wash their
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
clothes and use their toilets so the
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
city responded spent the money and were
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
able to respond and get them on a septic
 
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
able to respond and get them on a septic
system

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
a few years from now with the utility
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
going going forward
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
there may be reserve funds that can help
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
out with that instead of tapping into
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund and using property tax
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
levies for that um so i think that's
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
where the equity comes in so that that's
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
dover's perspective uh
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
speaking as you know again as the deputy
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
mayor there are things that
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
we would do we know we wanted it was in
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
our proposal that we know we want to
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
recommend a credit system we know that
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's required we know there'd be
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
litigation without it
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're now down to the details well can
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
you credit your way to zero or do you
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
need a margin because you've got to
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
support citywide efforts
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
and what's the value of each one and
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's where we are bringing in uh the
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
consultants entities whose business is
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
to look at these kinds of questions and
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
give us a strong solid technical answer
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that the proposal that goes in front
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the council uh next year is solid
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i think there is value in having
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
inclusion of private septic systems
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing that there'll be
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
certainly be limitations to that
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have the bandwidth to do
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
individual inspections of any any septic
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
systems uh that's
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have to make it a proactive approach
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
from a part of of the resident who'll
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
come to us and say
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
i want my credit come and take a look i
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
can show you i've been pumping i've had
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
it inspected
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
which is always a good thing to do for
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
any specific system now they can
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
leverage that and get a little break off
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
there better again that's preliminary
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how that might work for us
 
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.230 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how that might work for us
and

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
turn it over to gretchen for any
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
additional thought she might have you
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
know all right gretchen young um i'm the
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
environmental project manager for the
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
city of dover and um i'm also the chair
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
of the municipal alliance for adaptive
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
management which is a group of seven of
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
the regulated communities in the total
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
nitrogen general permit watershed um and
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
there are 12 regulated communities and a
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
number of those actually looked us for
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
some of the work that we're doing
 
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:19.750 align:start position:0%
some of the work that we're doing
and

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i just i mentioned that because there
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
are all of our communities um
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
have worked hard to get to a point with
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
epa there was a lot of negotiations to
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we have this
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility written into the permit it's
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
a five-year permit we're about half a
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
year almost three quarters of a year
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
through year one
 
00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.549 align:start position:0%
through year one
and

00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
there are people looking to see what
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh people just watching to make sure
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
that there there have been improvements
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements happening and
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
then five years
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
the epa will likely either extend the
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
permit allow the continued flexibility
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
or go to something that is more
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptive either more prescriptive
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to non-point source more or
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
go back to just regulating the
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment discharge and that
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
is a place that as a community we do not
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
want to be all of our communities we
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to be there
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
so we see this
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
any bill really that adds flexibility
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and opportunities for us to be creative
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
as as a positive for our communities
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know we really thank you for
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
taking a look at this thank senator
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
waters for
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this so that we just have
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and more opportunity to
 
00:59:36.559 --> 00:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and more opportunity to
address

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
nitrogen reductions in a in a cost
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
effective and meaningful way so we're
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
making real positive changes
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
another thing to add on
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
is uh there are ways to do at retrofits
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
to existing systems or to just put
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
install um there's a mecha you know
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
aeration device that you can put into a
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
septic system it's relatively low cost
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
about five thousand dollars maybe more
 
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.589 align:start position:0%
about five thousand dollars maybe more
um

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee of the municipal
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
alliance is actually uh ours excuse me
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
our stakeholder committee is working on
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
a pilot project in installing these in
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
another in a number of homes
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
but right now as
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
our deputy mayor mentioned we don't have
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
the capacity in the city to inspect all
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
so you know in order to really be able
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're working we
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
need some way to create a self-reporting
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
and through using the utility um and
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
allowing credits it really incentivizes
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
not only the
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh installation of these systems but
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
also the self-reporting of
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
how they're maintaining the systems how
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're continuing to use the systems
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we really think that this is
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity for the communities
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
to use to build on a stormwater utility
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
and has a number of co-benefits such as
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
um you know building reserves things
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
like that that that have been mentioned
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
before so with that i'll
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my recollection
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if this is correct or
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
not is that uh initially the epa was
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
saying that all of the wastewater
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
treatment plants had to be replaced and
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
that got people moving in a direction of
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find other ways to help fix
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is that correct
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean this has been going on
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a long time but
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
what the epa recognizes that there
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
is a nitrogen
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
impairment in the great bay and epa
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
their regulations
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
um are associated with what's called the
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
point source or the waste that's the
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant discharge
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
so to get to the hypothetical levels
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the great bay could
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
could handle for nitrogen the epa was
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
looking for just what they call limit of
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
technology improvements so essentially
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
redoing a
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
system now
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for a number of
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
years there have been a number of
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
upgrades dover included has spent quite
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
a bit of money in 2015 to upgrade this
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
system so
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
beyond what was um
 
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.870 align:start position:0%
beyond what was um
so

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
beyond what could potentially be
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
mandated which is the limit of
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
technology communities have made
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
improvements and are making improvements
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
but to take it to limit of technology
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
you start make you know you get less
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
return on your investment right so
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
people talk about there's only 30
 
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.309 align:start position:0%
people talk about there's only 30
percent

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
being discharged from the wastewater
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
treatment plants
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that's actually getting lower
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
because there have been in these
 
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.309 align:start position:0%
because there have been in these
improvements

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
very very expensive to get that last
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
little bit so communities
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
said to the epa we would rather spend
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
our money
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
on the non-point source because you're
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to make more impact and
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
potentially less funding
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's been a while
 
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.789 align:start position:0%
it's been a while
[Music]

01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
i thought i wrote 25 minutes okay i'm
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
i was the chair of the stormwater
 
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.270 align:start position:0%
i was the chair of the stormwater
commission

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
a number of years back and we looked at
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
any number of possible
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
alternatives for how we could begin to
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
get a handle on stormwater
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at individual properties we
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
looked at municipal
 
01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.870 align:start position:0%
looked at municipal
systems

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's very clear particularly from those
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
of us in the great bay estuary that
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
something has to be done but it's also
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
true relative to any of the urbanized
 
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.710 align:start position:0%
true relative to any of the urbanized
areas

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
this was what we came up with and the
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
commission was
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
had a lot of technical expertise that
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
had real tourists
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
and property owners community planners
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
etc and this is what they came up with
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
they did get into some detail about how
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
this might happen
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
i was also the chair of the
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.190 align:start position:0%
i was also the chair of the
recent

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
shoreline septic system commission
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
and you have recently seen the bill
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
that came out of that commission
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that was also carefully weighed by a
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
broad number of representatives
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
of different interest groups um
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
they were there were
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
lakes people
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
septic designers
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
there were technical people there was
 
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.029 align:start position:0%
there were technical people there was
des

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:42.309 align:start position:0%
des
the

01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
the
report

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the bill that i brought
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
to you i think was last month was uni
 
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.270 align:start position:0%
to you i think was last month was uni
uniformly

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
uniformly
 
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.029 align:start position:0%
uniformly
unanimously

01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
supported by everybody but the realtors
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
i can't remember
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
what the boogie man was
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
for that bill
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
this is the perfect
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
solution the perfect marriage
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
of those the
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
results of those two commissions it get
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
the uh we weren't sure we thought the
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
utility was a really great idea it's
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
been a while
 
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.870 align:start position:0%
been a while
for

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to undertake such a an
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
effort and i'm very proud of dover
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think manchester was playing with the
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
idea for a while
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't involve getting down to
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
the individual property owner and
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
and inspecting his system right
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
instead of looking at the black we're
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the white it has individual
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
property owners coming to the city
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
to to report on what their septic system
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
is like there's the rewards
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
set in instead of penalizing people who
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
have failing septic systems
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
or as the realtors object to
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
saying we want to look at your system
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
and see if it is
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
this provides an incentive for people to
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
to develop and maintain a good
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
so it's bringing together in total four
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
years of
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
effort of a wide
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
wide variety of experts and community
 
01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
wide variety of experts and community
members

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution that i think
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to take any
 
01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to take any
questions

01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative spang if you
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
could give us an example um say i'm a pr
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
private property owner i've got a well
 
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.549 align:start position:0%
private property owner i've got a well
um

01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not in the great bay area but
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
say i'm somewhere else some other
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
municipal uh area so i'm i'm not on uh
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
seth i'm not on town sewer
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
how what kind of fees so would i be
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
subject under this if my
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
my town adopted this and enacted it
 
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
my town adopted this and enacted it
um

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
would would i be subject to possibly a
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
monthly fee
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
or would it would
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that right i i
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
think you meant a private septic system
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
rather than a private well
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and i think that that's probably a
 
01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
um and i think that that's probably a
question

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
that would be best answered by the
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
deputy mayor of dover because they've
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
been getting into all of getting into
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
all the fine details about of how this
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the beauty of it it is
 
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
and that's the beauty of it it is
enabling

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
and rather than coming to the
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and trying to get the
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to be comfortable with
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
something that applies
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
statewide it's going back to the
 
01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
statewide it's going back to the
municipalities

01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what i've come to realize is
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
probably where we have to go for
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
solutions for our environmental problems
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
statewide regulation is a long way into
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
the future getting them it's
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities who care about their
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
local water
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
and know their the constraints
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
that their landowners are under
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
and relying upon those landowners to
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
support it is where we need to go in
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you with that i will
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
close the the hearing on uh
 
01:09:57.679 --> 01:09:59.270 align:start position:0%
close the the hearing on uh
257

01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
257
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on 305.
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i thought i was again putting in
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
extra time when i went to
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
one hour each and
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
put up a
 
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.709 align:start position:0%
put up a

again
um

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%

i am introducing
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh sb 305 relative to the operation of
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft and marked channels
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
straightforward

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:57.669 align:start position:0%
straightforward
bill

01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
the governor signed into law
 
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.669 align:start position:0%
the governor signed into law
restrictions

01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
against any use of personal watercraft
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the estuaries and the area of
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
hampton seabrook
 
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
hampton seabrook
harbor

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
harbor
 
01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
harbor
and

01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
i believe inadvertently
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
what it did was
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
selectman lane who loves who's over here
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
loves to use his personal watercraft but
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
he was restricted
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
from putting it in at the landing at
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
hampton falls
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so he came to me and asked me if i we
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
could revise the statute and looking
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
there was a second bill that actually
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
passed the house i think on a voice vote
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
that would have similarly restricted use
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the back channel behind newcastle and
 
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
in the back channel behind newcastle and
rye

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
rye
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that was brought by representative
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
murray i think um
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
that bill again would have been
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
a complete prohibition and that one was
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
aims to do and i think it does a good
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
job it's been amended and a little bit
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
um actually it is in the original form
 
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
um actually it is in the original form
um

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill was to say can we
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
reach a compromise that ensures access
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
and protects the environment which was
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
the goal of these because these are
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
fragile estuary they have fragile
 
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
fragile estuary they have fragile
ecosystems

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
ecosystems
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
but allows
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
people who use personal watercraft to
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
get out to the areas where it's really
 
01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
get out to the areas where it's really
fun

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
fun
 
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.910 align:start position:0%
fun
so

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
so
for

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
for
uh

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
mark the idea of putting in at the
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
hampton landing being a responsible
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
owner and staying in the channel not
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
going close to the shore going at
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
headway speed which is
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
i believe what we're supposed to do in
 
01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.510 align:start position:0%
i believe what we're supposed to do in
channels

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
channels
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
at least that's what i do um
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
the idea
is

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
you can get out to the ocean you can get
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
out to the piscataqua you can get out to
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
beyond little harbor
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and you can have fun on these watercraft
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
and you're not
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
restricted just because you have this
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
watercraft you know i have a whaler
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
which i take back in these areas and i'm
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
not restricted at all
 
01:13:28.159 --> 01:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
not restricted at all
um

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
so there's an issue of fairness and an
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue of access
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill tries to solve
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
while protecting the fragile ecosystems
 
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
while protecting the fragile ecosystems
in

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
both areas
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i hope you'll
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
see um
 
01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:48.390 align:start position:0%
see um
see

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
fit to pass this and i'm happy to take
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
any questions and i think mark's here to
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
share his experience
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
any uh questions by members of the
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative harp
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you senator welcome um i had a
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
question about the 300 feet how'd you
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
pick the 300 feet why isn't it 150 why
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it 500 where'd which get the 300
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the standard
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
setback from
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
for ecosystems remember these are titles
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
so they're a little bit different from
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
our lakes
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
300 feet gives you that buffer
 
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
300 feet gives you that buffer
um

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
but i'd be open i believe it's the
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
standard for tidal waters but i can look
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you just introduce yourself
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
crystal mclean and i'm a lieutenant with
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state police marine patrol
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
typically when we look at the definition
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
of ski craft which is a very specific
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
type of vessel in new hampshire waters
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
it can go over 25 miles an hour
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
is less than 13 feet in length and has
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
the capacity to carry not more than two
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
people so it's basically a smaller
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
version of a personal watercraft and in
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
that distance that they must be from
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
shore is 300 feet before they're allowed
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
to go over headway speed headway speed
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
being the slowest speed to maintain
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
steerage way
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the record she has not pulled me
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
over yet
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
no not yet well you got a faster boat
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
than her
 
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
than her
no

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
senator thank thank you i know more
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions but uh chris uh
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant would you
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh i'll have you fill out a card because
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think but we'll probably have some
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
questions uh for you certainly either
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
shortly or
 
01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:14.630 align:start position:0%
shortly or
uh

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
because right now uh
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
this mr lane
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
is on there but you can fill out the
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
card because
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
there may be some additional additional
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the of the board
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you elaine identify yourself
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is mark lane i'm a citizen
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
of hampton falls and also selectmen in
 
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.149 align:start position:0%
of hampton falls and also selectmen in
the

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
in hampton falls as well
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm here in support of the bill as
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think the current law is
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and and i really have a
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
problem with that um and let me give you
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
a little story so i've been riding my
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft using that that
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
gateway from the depot in hampton falls
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
to get out into the ocean
 
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.590 align:start position:0%
to get out into the ocean
since

01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'd say probably around 2012.
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
and a number of people in town
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
and out of town have used that same
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
waterway some for personal watercraft
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
some for boats
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the boats i see out there generally
 
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.310 align:start position:0%
and the boats i see out there generally
range

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
range
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
from you know 15 foot boats all the way
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
up i think the biggest one i've seen is
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
24 feet
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
so they can get quite large
 
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
so they can get quite large
um

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
but my quick story isn't
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think it was two years ago i
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
like i always do at high tide go out and
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
to try and get out in the ocean and i
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
made my way through the depot
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
and then i got pulled over by marine
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
patrol not by this officer but by
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
another officer and um
 
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.910 align:start position:0%
another officer and um
uh

01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
i wasn't aware that the bill had pat or
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
the law had passed at the time
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
so she's explaining to me um
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know that the law had passed and
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
that i was no longer
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
able to use that that access way which
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
was unfortunate for me because it meant
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
in order for me to use
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
the the ocean i would have to deal with
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
the traffic in hampton try and find
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
parking try and pay twenty dollars or
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars to to launch my boat
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
if i could actually find a place to
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
launch um so it became very inconvenient
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
um but anyway as she's explaining the
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
lot to me
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
out in the harbor
 
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.070 align:start position:0%
out in the harbor
um

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
two boats
 
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.110 align:start position:0%
two boats
came

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
came
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
up the same passageway that i had been
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
that that i that i use from hampton
 
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.950 align:start position:0%
that that i that i use from hampton
falls

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
falls
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
going at relatively
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
much faster speed than i was traveling
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
quite honestly um
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
and so i turned her and said well why
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
aren't you stopping these two boats and
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
she said well it's not illegal for them
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
to use it it's illegal for you to use it
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm keep in mind i'm in a 13
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
foot personal watercraft that
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
that means no more than three passengers
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
can go on it they're in much larger
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
boats going at faster speeds
 
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.669 align:start position:0%
boats going at faster speeds
um

01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
so immediately i you know that's when i
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
contacted senator sherman and and said
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
that i didn't think that it was um
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i thought the current law was
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against
 
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against
um

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft now i am a
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
environmentalist i i believe in making
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we maintain and protect our
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
environment um
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's why i think that the bill that
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
senator sherman has put forward
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
is a sensible one
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
changing the current law to allow
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft and boats to use
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
that access way
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
but at headway speed
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
is the logical um is the logical uh
 
01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:56.470 align:start position:0%
is the logical um is the logical uh
uh

01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
way to go i i guess uh
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a great compromise um
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
that way everyone can continue to use
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
the access way we can get out there we
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
can manage the uh environment by going
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
at headway speed um and uh enjoy that
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
particular spot and i and the only other
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
thing i'd add is that i think
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
is a slippery slope because it's an
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
important area for hampton falls
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
citizens as well they use that depot
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
quite frequently
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
it is a great access way and as i said
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
earlier it's our opportunity to get to
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
the ocean without having to deal with uh
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampton traffic
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate the time and certainly
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative spang
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's good to
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the word from the from the front
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
um the number of
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
areas that are
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
are affected by this bill
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me extends quite a bit
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
farther than just the area that you're
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
speaking of relative to
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
to hampton falls
 
01:21:20.639 --> 01:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
to hampton falls
um

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel then that
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly what you're talking
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
about is included in this list
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but how do you want to comment on the
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
other people other places that are this
 
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.709 align:start position:0%
other people other places that are this
yeah

01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i i can i can comment comment on a
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
few of them certainly um
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the the new castle area and out behind
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
where the wentworth hotel is and all of
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
that area and i think
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
i think um as senator sherman said they
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
tried to put the current law into place
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
in that area and it was vetoed by um
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
governor sununu so i
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i also um
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
if i understand it correctly and
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
when i was when i was talking earlier um
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
hampton falls was the only
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
place in the state that had a
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
restriction is that accurate for
 
01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
restriction is that accurate for
fifo

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
right and and but to answer your
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
question specifically i've had my
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft in a number of these
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
areas as well behind behind um
 
01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:44.629 align:start position:0%
areas as well behind behind um
uh

01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
specifically behind the wentworth and
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
kind of up through i don't know the
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
names of them so i can't particularly
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
tell which spot i'm referring to on this
 
01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
tell which spot i'm referring to on this
list

01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i think it should be the same
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
rules that apply because in these
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
current areas boats
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
i see boats going at fairly high speeds
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a law or a
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
headway speed law there
 
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
headway speed law there
but

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
in in these areas i feel like a headway
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
speed law makes sense
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
because that way you're not doing any
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
damage to the environment you're not you
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
know you know moving water at the same
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
speed as you would if you're going
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
anything over headway speed
 
01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
anything over headway speed
but

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense for me to allow a
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
boat at headway speed in any of these
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
areas but not allow personal watercraft
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
at headway speed right
 
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
at headway speed right
follow-up

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah having learned the hard way
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
i have a boat in maine and hardway is
 
01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
i have a boat in maine and hardway is
literal

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
literal
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
that the
configuration

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
configuration
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
particularly along coastlines and into
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
these estuaries changes all the time
 
01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.669 align:start position:0%
these estuaries changes all the time
right

01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
so i would expect that the channel would
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
be changing all the time
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
so the 300 feet
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
from any marshland
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
is that going to be difficult for
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
recreationists to figure out when their
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
feet 300 feet
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think so because the channels
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
are well marked
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
so when i use the channel i'm on the
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
markers you know that's how i make my
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
way out and and i do that because i
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to get stuck or i don't want
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
to get into any trouble especially if
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
the tide is not high tide
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i almost never go out when it's not
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
three hours on either side of high tide
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i think it's
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're very well marked areas so i
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
generally speaking i would say the
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
answer is no right okay and it's great
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
have just a comment i
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
i was looking for the word channel in
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i it it's
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the title but i'm glad to see that it
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
isn't identified anywhere in the rsa
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's where that we're putting in
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
right and and i guess as just a
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a law on the books that
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
any watercraft because it's either too
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
shallow or the the channel's too thin
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
then i'm not opposed to that i don't i i
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense and i think it's
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
the right thing for the environment
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
but if it's deemed that boats are okay
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
to use a channel i'm not sure why
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft can't use that same
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
channel especially at headway speed
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i and i the only other thing i i'd
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
add is that
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
um one argument that i did here was well
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to patrol
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
these areas um but i can honestly say
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that difficult because i was
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any other questions
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
by members of the committee
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
if not thank you very much thank you
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
are you can you available for some
 
01:26:10.239 --> 01:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
are you can you available for some
questions

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.669 align:start position:0%
and uh
i'll

01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll start
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the uh picking up from
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
what representative spang was talking
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
about and then also the uh
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
mr elaine uh why
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
should it be limited to personal
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
watercraft not
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
all boats should be at headway speed
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
well we remain neutral on the proposed
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh we
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
understand that the
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
the primary reason that it's being
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward is due to environmental
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
concerns from a boating safety
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective our patrol boats
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
do have the ability to patrol in the
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
channel areas however when we get
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the channels our typical
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
patrol boats
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
we require
 
01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.910 align:start position:0%
we require
other

01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
vessels within the fleet to
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to access some of these areas
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
because of the tidal activity the mud
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
especially at low tide
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
exactly why it was brought forth as
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft aside from the
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
environmental factors so i can't give
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
you a full
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh answer to your question
 
01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh answer to your question
um

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
and representative smiths
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
lieutenant for taking my question um
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
for could you explain um briefly
 
01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
for could you explain um briefly
uh

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.669 align:start position:0%
uh
why

01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
why that particular those particular
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
channels in around newcastle were picked
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that we were on the boat
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
with you doing the field trip and it's
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
and it was explained to us why this was
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
a good way to write this and i just
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
wanted for the benefit of those who
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't remember or weren't there if you
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
could explain just how this will be able
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be patrolled kind of certainly well
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the area where the channel does exist
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
behind newcastle and up into the hampton
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
harbor areas that are specified
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
it does allow access to these areas and
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
in areas that people
 
01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
in areas that people
recreate

01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
recreate
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
they enjoy with vessels of all different
 
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
they enjoy with vessels of all different
configurations

01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
configurations
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
so that allows them to still access
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
these sites
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
but at the same time taking into con to
 
01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.790 align:start position:0%
but at the same time taking into con to
um

01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
taking into account the
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
ability to monitor
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
and maintain the environmental quality
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
and aspect of it
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else from
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the committee for a question
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative spain
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know who can answer this
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
question possibly only the sponsor but
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of stuck in my head that this
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
is only personal watercraft
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
when mr lane is alluding to
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
other boats
 
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
other boats
um

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know i guess we don't have any
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors here who could
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
say whether
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
there would be any problem with opening
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
up to other boats what is your feeling
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
typically uh
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
at this point as we discussed earlier
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is the only area in the state where
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft specifically have
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of prohibition we do have
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
numerous lakes throughout the state
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
where other boats
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
are banned or restricted due to
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
horsepower restrictions engine
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions speed restrictions
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
we also have a definition for ski craft
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
as i testified to
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
earlier which is a very narrow
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
definition of watercraft in new
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire those do have additional laws
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and regulations that they need to abide
 
01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
and regulations that they need to abide
by

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.870 align:start position:0%
by
the

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
the way i like to try to describe what
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
these types of vessels are is when we
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
take it to the motor vehicle world we
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
start with very broad categories and in
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle world we have a motor
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle and in the boating world we have
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
a boat and then as we narrow it down and
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
we're getting more descriptive we go
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
from a boat to a personal watercraft so
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're starting to describe that a little
 
01:30:32.239 --> 01:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
we're starting to describe that a little
better

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
in more detail and from the boating side
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
a boat to a
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me a motor vehicle to a pickup
 
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
excuse me a motor vehicle to a pickup
truck

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
and now we further define it
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
from the personal watercraft to a ski
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
craft and on the other side that pickup
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
truck to a four-door uh
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
you name it model version
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that ski craft is very very specific
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
the personal watercraft is kind of that
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
in-between definition and once again
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently the seacoast is the only area
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
that specific
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh prohibition for personal watercraft
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the state whereas we do have numerous
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions for
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the very narrow ski craft regulations
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
and descriptions as well as
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
boats in general
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions mr hump
 
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions mr hump
representative

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question i don't know if uh
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can shed light on this for me um
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
have you have you seen the bill i have
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
yet okay um i'm also looking at the
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
original or the one that's currently in
 
01:31:52.159 --> 01:31:53.030 align:start position:0%
original or the one that's currently in
law

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
this says
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh 300 feet from any marsh land or
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
flatten hampton seabrook estuary
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then on this one there's very
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
specific places
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
does the one that's in place now
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
cover all these specific places or are
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
there specific places that aren't
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
covered by that i believe the new
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
amendment would cover all of those areas
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
yeah uh as previously proposed okay
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.639 --> 01:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.709 align:start position:0%
questions
comments

01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
seeing uh
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh mr deers uh
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
i know you have an uh
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the area and uh
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
is and i'll just if you you could you
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
can uh
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
on the relative uh
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
the effect of
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
boats in the area
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you think it would be a good idea
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
if this committee put in an amendment to
 
01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:02.550 align:start position:0%
if this committee put in an amendment to
uh

01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh to include votes as opposed to
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
these power crafts or you just
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
not my job mine
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is ted diers and
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator of the watershed
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
management bureau and i will um answer
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
directly uh some of your question and
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
dance heartily around the rest okay um
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
i have testified on this bill any number
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
of times in its former iterations
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the impetus of this bill is pretty
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
simple is that
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
some of these i think what what
 
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.110 align:start position:0%
some of these i think what what
colloquial

01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
colloquial
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
colloquially if i could get that word
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
out without hurting myself
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
um would be referred to as jet skis
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
um that the problem with that was that
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
that fomented this whole issue was
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
really people going out on jet skis and
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
tooling around in marshes
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
salt marshes
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
at low lowished uh
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
water so just enough water to cover the
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
marsh to get out through the channels
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
and you have these broad what be what
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
looks like a you know
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
a big field of grass during low tide at
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
high tide is completely covered with
 
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
high tide is completely covered with
water

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so people
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
were going out there
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of the channel and tooling
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
around and ripping up the salt marsh
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
because that water could be covering it
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
but it could only be a small bit and at
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
the same time also into very narrow
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
channels channels that are only you know
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
five feet wide which again
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
i evidently are extremely fun to be able
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
to move around in which stirs up
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
sediment which causes other issues and
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
erosion within those pretty delicate
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
channels our salt marshes are already
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
under pretty significant um impact
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
through lots of different you know
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
sources going on so that was the impetus
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill that was been the nature of
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation all through all of this
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about newcastle
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the small marshes around newcastle
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
which again are highly impacted by by
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
development and other things going on
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
as well as all of those marshes which
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
are in hampton harbor which is the vast
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the salt marsh
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire these are incredibly
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
important ecosystems that's what was
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
recognized through the original bill and
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
why this became a thing
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
generally boats don't do that generally
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
boats have a propeller sure there are
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
jets uh jet motors for for boats but
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
again the issue was primarily focused on
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
those individual you know two
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
one to two person uh
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
craft sometimes i guess now there's
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
designs that have a couple more people
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
that you could throw on there
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
but that are have a very low draft and
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
are really built for that kind of
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh activity so the idea was to prohibit
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
those p those in in very specific places
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
that is the surface of the marshes
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
what we've learned and i think the
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
lieutenant described this very well and
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think as the speakers behind me have
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
spoken very well is that we learned that
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
that was a bit of a sledgehammer
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and what's what i see in this amendment
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
is is taking a scalpel to it to make it
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
more fair for the people who are
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
recreating there the people who are
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing while still
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
protecting those marshes against the
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of um impacts that that the less
 
01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
kinds of um impacts that that the less
desirable

01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
desirable
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
activities can cause
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
so this our our department of
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
environmental services has never taken a
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
position on this bill i've been asked to
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of testimony that i've
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
just provided in terms of what do we
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
know about salt marshes and how they
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
work and the impacts on them by certain
 
01:36:40.159 --> 01:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
work and the impacts on them by certain
watercraft

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
but we've never taken a position and i
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
dare to take a position on this bill at
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
this particular moment
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
mr dears you should be in politics
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's your job sir very well very well
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
done all right thank you any other
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions i'm happy
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
well you've answered i think
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative spang's question and mine
 
01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.790 align:start position:0%
representative spang's question and mine
and

01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative smith for the question
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to get a clarification so it
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like what you're saying is that
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
the jet skis as they're called
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
have a much shallower draft so they can
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
go into that shallower water but then
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
they just tear things up whereas a boat
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
like with an outboard motor or an
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
inboard motor
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
it goes deeper into the water and so
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
they pretty much avoid them because
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're just going to get stuck
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
again this is not a strict methodology
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
there are people behind me are much
 
01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
there are people behind me are much
better

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
much more experienced voters than i
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
probably around this table that are much
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
more experienced than i
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
the behavior tends to be isolated to
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
those kinds of craft and that's what why
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
it was regulated as such okay thank you
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
mr lane you want to
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
mr lane
 
01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
mr lane
just

01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
you have uh
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
yeah turn it on yep thank you again um
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i agree with everything that the
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
gentleman just spoke to in terms of
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
jet skis
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
going into
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
areas where
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
at low tide the marsh would be grass
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
i agree that should be prohibited and
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm suggesting is that
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
the channel
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
that boats
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
can travel
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
should also be allowed to be traveled by
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
jet skis
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
they

01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
they can be patrolled
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
the marshland you know from the hampton
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
harbor so you can see if people are
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
going out into areas that they shouldn't
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
be going to but i'd also suggest that
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
many boats today are jet propelled that
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
are out there so larger boats but
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
so again that the whole lower draft
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
issue so they
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
technically could be going into these
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
areas they shouldn't be going either
 
01:39:16.239 --> 01:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
areas they shouldn't be going either
so

01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
i think the the compromise really is
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the areas that are suggested in here
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
where boats can currently travel
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft should also be able
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
to travel because they're not doing any
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
more damage in these areas than a boat
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
would do
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
in fact i'd argue that potentially
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing less because boats can go
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
significantly faster and create a much
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
in this bill i don't think is
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
there everybody's allowed there it's
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
just their speed
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
it should be at headway speed i'll all
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
watercraft that's that's why i support
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
this build because i think i think
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
all watercraft
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
in these areas should be relegated to
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
headway speed i think that makes a lot
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
of sense and it's a good compromise
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
currently the law says boats can use
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
this area but
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft can't
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
yeah but they've got to go slow yeah
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
no they can't they can't
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
the current law says we can't go out
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
there at all right now
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
this still
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is saying
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
we should the personal watercraft should
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
be able to go where boats can go as long
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
as we're doing it at headway speed
 
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.149 align:start position:0%
as we're doing it at headway speed
yeah

01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you questions thank you
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
if anyone uh
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
no one else on the committee and now no
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
one else wishes to speak i will call i
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
will call 305 the hearing 305
 
01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:56.629 align:start position:0%
will call 305 the hearing 305
closed

01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i and we're right almost
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes so
 
01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.510 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes so
this

01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
we'll go to 258.
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're right on right back on time uh
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
well let's when we
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%

um

01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:39.669 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.679 --> 01:42:59.830 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman senator david
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
waters district four here to introduce
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh 258
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
relative degrees of african americans
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
alive during the period of american
 
01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:36.390 align:start position:0%
alive during the period of american
enslavement

01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
enslavement
 
01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
enslavement
um

01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
simple description of the bill and i'll
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
get into the details a little a little
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
bit later is that this builds on
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
existing statute about protection of
 
01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.709 align:start position:0%
existing statute about protection of
local

01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
burial grounds in new hampshire to
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is participation of
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
the descendant
 
01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:52.149 align:start position:0%
the descendant
community

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with african-american
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
gravesites in the in the state
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of history around these
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
sites uh if you're interested you can
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
look to a few months ago a very
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
extensive article in the new yorker
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
magazine called underground which was
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the rediscovery of african
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
american grave sites
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
across the country and starts out with a
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
quite a substantial story about the
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
portsmouth new hampshire
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
negro bearing ground but you can also
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
look at the new hampshire public radio
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
series from a
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
year before last uh four series that
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
they did of videos and stories on four
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
african-american burial sites in
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and then also if you go to
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
black heritage trail of new hampshire
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
there is an hour long black heritage
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
trail history of concord that we filmed
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
and has quite a bit on the burial sites
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
in concord so if you're interested in
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
this in this subject and you don't have
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
one of these sites in your own town
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are good places to
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
find out about the larger history of it
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i bring this forward because uh
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
there has been just such a increase in a
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
number of african-american burial sites
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire that have been
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
rediscovered and that people are
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
interested in making efforts to preserve
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
restore and appropriately mark and and
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
commemorate them
 
01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.709 align:start position:0%
commemorate them
my

01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%

i was at the university of new hampshire
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
i did spend a lot of my time in
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
graveyards and i did a lot of work on
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
early new england
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
burial grounds the restoration and
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and preservation but i also come to you
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
as a founding board member of the black
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
heritage trail of new hampshire and the
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
portsmouth black heritage trail before
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
that organizations that have done a
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
great deal not just in portsmouth but
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
now across the state to identify and
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
preserve and mark these these sites
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
i think there's an extraordinary history
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
here and really something just
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
extraordinary for new hampshire to
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
celebrate um as we discover these things
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
we found these amazing people and how
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
they contribute to our freedom story in
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
the state and the values of the people
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
here and let me just mention uh a few of
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
them um perhaps the most famous is owner
 
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
them um perhaps the most famous is owner
judge

01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
stains and she's famous because she was
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
what they called back then the body
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
servant of martha washington
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
and she escaped from the president's
 
01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
and she escaped from the president's
house

01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
house
in

01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
philadelphia when that's before dc
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
washington was established as the
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
national capital
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
in philadelphia
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
if you were an enslaved person who was
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
resident for more than six months
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
continuously you were free
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
and washington with his entourage of
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
enslaved folks first in new york and now
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
then in
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
philadelphia knew that uh this six-month
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
clock was ticking so he would circulate
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
his enslaved people
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
giving pretext for trips over to
 
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.229 align:start position:0%
giving pretext for trips over to
delaware

01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
delaware
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
which is a slave state or down to back
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
to mount vernon
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
and um owner
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
judge stains knew that this was in the
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
works she also knew that she was going
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be given as a wedding present to
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
martha washington's niece whom she did
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
not like
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
but she had particularly anxieties
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps over the fiancee of that
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
of that woman who was did not have a
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
good reputation
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you know quite likely she feared
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
rape um as that occurred to other of her
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
family members at mount vernon so she
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
got on a ship bound for for portsmouth
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
why portsmouth well george washington
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
had made his first presidential trip
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh to portsmouth in 1789 with his
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
entourage of five or six enslaved people
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
and you better believe they got to know
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
the local local community and so she
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
knew that she would find a welcome
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
welcoming reception among the black
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
community of new hampshire so she came
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
up here
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
and then she happened to be seen in the
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
streets of portsmouth by one of the
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
daughters of john langdon
 
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.830 align:start position:0%
daughters of john langdon
who

01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
knew washington's
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
martha washington's niece well had seen
 
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.629 align:start position:0%
martha washington's niece well had seen
ona

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
ona
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
at the president's house in philadelphia
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
and said oh i saw ona so the word go
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
back to washington and he
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
sent slave catchers up here
 
01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.550 align:start position:0%
sent slave catchers up here
repeatedly

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
repeatedly
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
to try to either persuade or trick or
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
kidnap her back into slavery so she
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
um took off to hide out in greenwood new
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire where she spent the next
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
almost 50 years of her
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
life she married a mariner
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
she had daughters one of whom became a
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
water colorist
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
and she lived there
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
what is now way out in the woods but
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
always threatened by capture by martha
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
washington or her descendants until she
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
died in 1848 she was interviewed two
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
times around 1840 and she told the story
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
of her thirst for freedom as she as she
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
as she called it an extraordinary site
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's out in the woods it's been much
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
damaged the stones are broken down
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for that site to
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
be recognized also mention samson battis
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
who had a great history related here to
 
01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
who had a great history related here to
concord

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
he was born about 1750 probably in
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
rollinsford or durham he was enslaved
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
to one of the founders john moore of
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
of canterbury and uh then served in the
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
american revolution um in
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
head's company we have heads portrait on
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
the halls down in the state house
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
and gained his freedom and some land a
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
few years afterwards and there was a
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
large group of african-americans
 
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
large group of african-americans
in

01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
canterbury he had like 11 children one
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
of his daughters had 18 children but the
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
never more than five people listed in
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
the census who were african-american for
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
canterbury pretty typical
 
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.109 align:start position:0%
canterbury pretty typical
um

01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
he was uh really famous in the early
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
1800s because he led the governor's
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
color guard in his unif revolutionary
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
uniform in the parade of the color guard
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
which would escort the governor
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
um for his inauguration and on artillery
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh days as well very well known in his
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
time um but
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
neglected he died at age 102 in 1852
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
much neglected afterwards uh his burial
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
ground as he was at least he's in a town
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
cemetery of
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
canterbury but he's way down in a swamp
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes they would bury
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
african-american abuse way down there
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
his the only stone has a marker because
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
he has a
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war marker but there are a
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
lot of other buried around him that we
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't know and then there's a badass
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
family burial ground
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
out in another part of canterbury now he
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
has some descendants around
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
but the reason for this bill is what if
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
we don't know who the descendants are
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
for example jeff he was enslaved by the
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
minister of deerfield and almost any
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
town in early
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire before 1800 had a minister
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
there were slaves because the ministers
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
had enslaved people
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
um when the old burial ground was moved
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
out of the woods into the new burial
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
ground um they brought the minister in a
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
stone his body but jeff had been buried
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
just outside the wall also kind of
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
typical they left jeff
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
up there
recently

01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:56:05.599 --> 01:56:06.390 align:start position:0%
recently
the

01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
old the black heritage trail has been
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
placing markers for burial grounds and
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
noted african-american sites around the
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
state deerfield
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
hancock milford amherst just to mention
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
a few the most famous of course is in
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
concord where
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
it had been known that there was a negro
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
bearing ground in concord probably
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh buried there both enslaved and and
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
free the black the portsmouth black
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
header trail placed a plaque at the head
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the street and the city decided to go
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and do a sewer repair
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
and they dug
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
right down into those graves and i went
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
i met i was there and saw the sewer pipe
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
running running right through the rows
 
01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:47.589 align:start position:0%
running running right through the rows
of

01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
of coffins all work stopped and if you
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
go to portsmouth now the descendant
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
community that the portsmouth decided to
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
name um
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
formed and they've created an
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary monument
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
there and reburied those remains of
 
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.350 align:start position:0%
there and reburied those remains of
folks

01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh who were nameless and unknown
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise but genetic work had shown
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
that they were of african origin there
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
were some filed teeth and some other
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
markers as as well and so now the couple
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
hundred people who are buried under the
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
houses under the street there are
 
01:57:17.679 --> 01:57:19.109 align:start position:0%
houses under the street there are
respectfully

01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
01:57:19.119 --> 01:57:20.070 align:start position:0%
respectfully
um

01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh noted so back back to what the the
 
01:57:23.199 --> 01:57:24.709 align:start position:0%
uh uh noted so back back to what the the
bill

01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
does is that the logistics here is that
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
it again builds on
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
existing language in protection of bare
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
grounds this committee and other
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
committees over decades have done a
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
great job of making sure that our burial
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
grounds such a distinctive part of our
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
history and our landscape are protected
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
burial grounds in fact are owned by the
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
descendants of the people buried there
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
not by the surrounding property owner
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
but existing statute very carefully lays
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
out the property rights of the person
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding it so if you want to do
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
genealogical research or you want to go
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
in and do a restoration and preservation
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the site
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
we the legislation set up a posting
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and notification of land or
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
negotiations and to make sure that the
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
right kind of way
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
to go in there and do the work you're
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to do is be approved by the
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
governing body and and so on and these
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
are good these are good production
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
protections and they work very well
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
now sometimes it's necessary to move one
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
of these sites and we have good
 
01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:24.709 align:start position:0%
of these sites and we have good
statutory

01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
language around that as well if it has
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
to happen here's the procedure and of
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
course dot is exempt from a lot of this
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they have their own procedures
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
because yes sometimes they've got to
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
widen a road and
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes the burial ground has to be
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
moved but in each case there's a
 
01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
moved but in each case there's a
procedure

01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
so what this does is that it recognizes
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
that we need to add on one thing to that
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
that if it's a grave site
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
where african americans
 
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.070 align:start position:0%
where african americans
african-americans

01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
african-americans
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
buried from the period of enslavement
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
when we can be sure
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
that they had no control over their
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
burial that their family members or
 
01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.310 align:start position:0%
burial that their family members or
others

01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
did not have control over that process
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
that now if one of those graves is going
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be restored preserved
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
marked in some way
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the descendant community be
 
01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.589 align:start position:0%
that the descendant community be
involved

01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of existing statute that if
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
you can find somebody who descended
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know from the bare ground you you
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
that they still own that so they have
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
rights over
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
what happens in there but for these
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
folks highly unlikely that there be any
 
01:59:21.679 --> 01:59:23.109 align:start position:0%
folks highly unlikely that there be any
genealogical

01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
genealogical
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
information about that so it names the
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
black heritage trail of new hampshire or
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
other similar organizations who would
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
have expertise who would kind of know
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of grave rituals performed at
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
the time what kind of internment might
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
performed what's an appropriate ceremony
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps to
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
perform now if there's going to be a
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
marker put up what is the appropriate
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
language that might be put on that or if
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's a plaque out of the roadside or
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
something um what kind of plaque would
 
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.669 align:start position:0%
something um what kind of plaque would
that

01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
would that be so that's why this notion
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
of a descendant
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
community here
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then um starting on line 13
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
this again it is very similar to
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
existing language that if you're going
 
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.149 align:start position:0%
existing language that if you're going
to

02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
disturb or remove anything from a
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
african-american grave site um check in
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the descendant community
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
if there has to be a disturbance or
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
removal because of construction or
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the reason there may
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:24.870 align:start position:0%
may be
then

02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can do that but it has to be done
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully in consultation with the
 
02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
respectfully in consultation with the
descendant

02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
descendant
 
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.030 align:start position:0%
descendant
community

02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
there is one
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind of trip wire here that if it starts
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
to become clear that this person may
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
have had native heritage as well as
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
african-american heritage
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
we have the native american graves
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
protection and repatriation act that's
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
federal statute it's been around for
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
decades now and that has very specific
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
rules which new hampshire follows now
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
very very religiously
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
if such a site is identified of what you
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
do at that point
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
i will say that when i was at unh i
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
served as the nagpra
 
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.109 align:start position:0%
served as the nagpra
officer

02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
as we dealt with human remains
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
of native american descent and grave
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
goods that there were a lot of
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of examples in
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
the collections at the university of new
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we had almost a 20-year
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
process of working with the abnaki
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
community to make sure that they were
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
returned and appropriately reburied
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
where there are so that that's why
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh in there and then a couple other
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute just you know
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
because cemetery statute is is spread
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
around in various
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
places um
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's why there's some other mentions
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
of other places the cemetery
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
trustees and so they're different places
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
in statute where the same language
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
gets put in
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
you also notice on page two
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
that online 13

02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.390 align:start position:0%

resources

02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
department of cultural natural resources
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
can serve as an advisory
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
capacity municipalities and descendants
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
they do that already now with burial
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
grounds and with native american
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
remains so that's they're there to help
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
if they can be of help
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the descendant
 
02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
as well as the descendant
community

02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
and lastly i'll mention one other aspect
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
this has to do with
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
potential human remains
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
and associated grave goods
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
that may have been removed from the
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
sites and maybe in other collections
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
for example i know that there are
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
grave markers for african americans
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
that have been removed from burial
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
grounds and may be on display
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
in one case i know are on display in a
 
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
in one case i know are on display in a
historical

02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
historical
 
02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:53.669 align:start position:0%
historical
society

02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's necessary you know if a
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
grave site's being removed or if a
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
marker that's left there is obviously
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
deteriorating and will soon be gone
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
then okay you know maybe that ought to
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
be in a museum somewhere
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
but there are also maybe human remains
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
and this is why the last paragraph here
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
says okay
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
for your medical society if you're a
 
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
for your medical society if you're a
university

02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
university
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you're another historical society
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
check your collections
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with it this procedure
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
they've done it on the native american
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
things under federal statute says check
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
what do you have
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
if you have something
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
then you ought to
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
work with the senate community to see
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
how these appropriately and respectfully
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
can be dealt with
 
02:03:36.719 --> 02:03:37.750 align:start position:0%
can be dealt with
um

02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and who knows what's out there you know
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
you with the native american things we
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know to us and and at unh for
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
years said we don't have anything we
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't have anything well once we kept
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
asking we found out yeah we had a lot
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
and that was true some other places
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
as well so um will we find things i
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
suspect we will i will
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
just mention i know of a finger bone
 
02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
just mention i know of a finger bone
necklace

02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
necklace
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
that is made of at least five
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
individuals finger bones into a necklace
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
that is in a collection of one
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
university in the state
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably of african african-american
 
02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:16.550 align:start position:0%
probably of african african-american
origin

02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
we also know from new hampshire
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
histories of cases where it was very
 
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
histories of cases where it was very
common

02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
common
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
that african-american graves or
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
or bodies would be taken or the graves
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be dug up by medical students
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's one of the reasons we first began
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
once the part the dartmouth medical
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
school was established you're going to
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
notice in state statute you start to see
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
state statute on grave robbing
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
because they were being used for
 
02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.310 align:start position:0%
because they were being used for
dissection

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
dissection
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and there's uh one famous case where
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
a couple doctors from hollis
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
when an african-american was executed uh
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
they bought his body
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i did it for a dissection with their
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
medical students but then one of them
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
removed his skin had a tan and made into
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
a pair of boots
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
now i don't know if that pair of boots
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
is still walking around so you know some
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
some is somewhere in a historical
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
society or not but you know this
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's an unfortunate this is what
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
happened this is what happened these
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
things happen we all we all know this so
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
if it is the case that any of these
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
remains are out there let's let's take a
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
moment to make sure that they're
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully uh dealt with
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
um so i'm sorry to go on on so long and
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
i will mention mr chairman that
 
02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
i will mention mr chairman that
um

02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
several members of the black heritage
 
02:05:28.639 --> 02:05:29.830 align:start position:0%
several members of the black heritage
trail

02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
trail
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and other groups had
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
hoped to be here today i do have a
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
letters that were submitted um
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
senate hearing and if you if they
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
weren't also set to you i will have them
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
xeroxed and you know after the hearing
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'll bring them up
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
up to you but uh we had a lot of people
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
sign in doesn't sign in support of this
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the senate and i have some of
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
those uh letters but it is sometimes
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
hard for people to
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to to get up here um so my hope is
 
02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:57.830 align:start position:0%
to uh to to get up here um so my hope is
that

02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know we have a great history to
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
celebrate extraordinary sights and
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
amazing people
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
that are part of new hampshire history
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
which is just great to learn about and
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
so i hope that these folks whose
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
humanity was not even recognized when
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
they were alive
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
can have our respect
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
where they now now rest so thank you mr
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i when i was reading over that last
 
02:06:32.239 --> 02:06:33.589 align:start position:0%
um i when i was reading over that last
paragraph

02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
i wasn't quite sure what it was headed
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
toward because it looked like
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
all or any of these were responsible for
 
02:06:43.599 --> 02:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
all or any of these were responsible for
inventorying

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
inventorying
 
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.870 align:start position:0%
inventorying
any

02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
materials or remains anywhere in the
 
02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.030 align:start position:0%
materials or remains anywhere in the
state

02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
um but i i think that maybe you're
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
saying that they should inventory any
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
remains or materials in their possession
 
02:07:00.639 --> 02:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
remains or materials in their possession
yes

02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:02.550 align:start position:0%
yes
yeah

02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
02:07:04.159 --> 02:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
um

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
exactly and maybe that's uh maybe that'd
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
be helpful to clarify that intention was
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
intended and and clearly any remains or
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
other materials from african-american
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
graves so we're not this is not a huge
 
02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:16.870 align:start position:0%
graves so we're not this is not a huge
fishing

02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
expedition but
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know if you've worked with with
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
historical societies or museums or
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
universities they
 
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
they inventory things right that's what
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
they they inventory their collection so
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
i i think that they're going to be able
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
to go through their inventories and tell
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly if there's something they
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
better take a closer and closer look at
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
and where will these what will be the
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
repository of all of these inventories
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
and will there be a single repository
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
well suitable disposition um
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
i will say from my experience in with
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
both communities
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the native american community
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
they would want to rebury
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
near the site
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
from which they were removed
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
well excuse me i meant the out of all of
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
these inventories
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
when the say the university has an
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
inventory and i'm sorry what where will
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
there be a central place where
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question that doesn't
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
because i'm not i'm not interested in
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
the records as much as the bill says if
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
your records show you have this
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
then um here's the procedure
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
to follow and uh you know some some
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
communities may say well we'll we'll put
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
these remains um if we know where they
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
came from
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
we'll put them back there
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
if that site no longer exists because it
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
was removed maybe there'll be a
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
respectful place in the town cemetery
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'd just say an amherst part of the
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
church that was built in 1840 was built
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
on top of the negro bearing ground a lot
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
of slave inside people in amherst um so
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know and since there are
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
these sites there are likely to be lots
 
02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:58.629 align:start position:0%
these sites there are likely to be lots
of

02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
lots of um appropriate appropriate
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
places but i you know i think this is
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the communities and upon the advice
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
of black headers trail new hampshire and
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
division of historical cultural
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
resources to say what would make sense
 
02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
resources to say what would make sense
here

02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
what makes sense for this great thank
 
02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:27.830 align:start position:0%
what makes sense for this great thank
you

02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much senator
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
for taking the question and introducing
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i just have a question
 
02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:38.390 align:start position:0%
um i just have a question
in

02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
on let's see page two line three
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
any african-american remains marker gate
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
or associated
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
mortuary or archaeological materials
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
that have been removed from a site shall
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
be returned for reburial
 
02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
be returned for reburial
um

02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm thinking of um it's the
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
archaeological materials
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking of like
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
say clay pots pipes
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
things like personal belongings that
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
would normally go into a museum
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
or or maybe they already are in a museum
 
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
or or maybe they already are in a museum
um

02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
so now they have to go back into the
 
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.270 align:start position:0%
so now they have to go back into the
ground

02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
um that was the
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
the grave practices here um are
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
extensive uh there
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
there has been these archaeological
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
things just as you say they may be
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
pottery shards
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
they might be clamshells which are often
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
buried with african-american folks
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's actually um salt might be
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
sprinkled to still the spirit
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the deceased as well um there
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
may have been associated clothing
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um in the south there's a tradition of
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
of memory jugs where a plastic jug would
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
be covered with plaster and then all the
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
kind of things are in the pockets or in
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
a household keys coins
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
hair brushes might be put into the
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
plaster and that jug was left
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
on the grave
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
breaking the pottery of the last the
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
last meal or the utensils that were
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
touched by the deceased now they were
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
meant to be grave goods that they were
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
placed there because they were
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate accompaniments
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the of the deceased
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and um so that's that's why they are
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
considered grave goods and um you know
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
as same case with native american
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
materials that these are these are
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
considered sacred
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
or associated with the deceased and
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
ought to go back
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the ground uh so that spirit can
 
02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
in the ground uh so that spirit can
continue

02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
um to rest so that that's what museums
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
are doing now i mean again this is this
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
kind of repatriation or returning or
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
reburial is something that a lot of
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
these collections are quite
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh quite used to because of their other
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
experiences so that that's that's why
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um this is recommended here and i and i
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
would just say you know to be personal
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
about it that i buried my father with
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
his cane
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
and uh had a distinctive silver top
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
and goodness knows if that gravesite had
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
to be dug up for a highway or something
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't want that cane that was
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
that was with him i wouldn't want that
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to the museum somewhere you know
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's why i put it in a coffin with
 
02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
that's why i put it in a coffin with
them

02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
so i think we can kind of have a sense
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
and african-american specialists in this
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
can tell you very very
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
extensively about how these rituals
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
i know
 
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
i know
it's

02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
it's
it's

02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
it is stuff um
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
it the the act is relative to
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
african americans alive during the
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
period of american enslavement but i see
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
in the parts of this bill
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
seems to be part of the discussion
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
especially toward the
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
part on
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
page two but it has been probably
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
possibly also in others
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
about um
 
02:13:27.119 --> 02:13:28.709 align:start position:0%
about um
the

02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's just simply speaks to
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
african-american graves period doesn't
 
02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
african-american graves period doesn't
uh

02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't differentiate in the time period
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for your your question but i
 
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
right 10 to 11.
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
this is why i had a definition section
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay so african-american
 
02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay so african-american
grave

02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
grave
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
as it's used for the rest of it
 
02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
as it's used for the rest of it
means

02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
the grave of an individual of african
 
02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:05.510 align:start position:0%
the grave of an individual of african
descent

02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
descent
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
who was or was likely to have been alive
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
during a period of american enslavement
 
02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.390 align:start position:0%
during a period of american enslavement
okay

02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
so that that definitional
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
carries with it and and the reason for
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
that is that you know i mean somebody
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
but that period of enslavement is when
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
they likely
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
know control the family or nobody the
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
the enslavers are no control over where
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're buried or how they were buried
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's why and also would have
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
would have this historical significance
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
issue okay
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
all right that's uh answered my question
 
02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
all right that's uh answered my question
uh

02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i don't
 
02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.669 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i don't
understand

02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh the descendant aspect of it i mean
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
how do they find descendants is that a
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
very involved process i don't understand
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
that part of it
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and you know
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's the case on all of our burial
 
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:06.550 align:start position:0%
it's the case on all of our burial
grounds

02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.350 align:start position:0%
grounds
um

02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know some of them have very
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
prominent markers with lots of names and
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
by the way they're oftentimes people are
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
still in town right
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
um so sometimes that is that is quite
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
easily known
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
other times it may be that the family
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
has left you know moved moved to ohio
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
where the farms aren't tilt-wise back in
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the 1800s
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
or otherwise are not are not known so
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
the existing statute says
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
on this and we'll cover this is that
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
um here's the procedure you use to try
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
and if you're on genealogical research
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
you can't discover when do post it
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
and if there's nothing come up with the
 
02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
and if there's nothing come up with the
posting

02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
posting
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
then you work with the town that's the
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
kind of existing language
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
what this is just saying same thing
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
that if you don't know
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
if there are any descendants around
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh that have already been identified for
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
the african-american
 
02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:09.589 align:start position:0%
the african-american
person

02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
same procedure you approach you try to
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
find out but then if you cannot
 
02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
find out but then if you cannot
determine

02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's when the descendant community
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
kicks in
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
to say that those those individuals i
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
mean this is what was done in portsmouth
 
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
mean this is what was done in portsmouth
um

02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
anonymous graves 200 people
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
who knows and any descendants valerie
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
cunningham's research
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
could not find descendants of anybody
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
she discovered from that early
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
early period in portsmouth so that's why
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:16:38.559 --> 02:16:39.349 align:start position:0%
the um
the

02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:39.359 --> 02:16:40.629 align:start position:0%
the
cities

02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
cities
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
formed and assembled a special
 
02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:43.349 align:start position:0%
formed and assembled a special
commission

02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
that had
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
the african-american um
 
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
the african-american um
organizations

02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
named as the descendant community who
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
then worked with
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
how to do the re-burial and and so forth
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's you know surprising though i
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
published in our extensive article about
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
samson badass amazing
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
man what a patriot
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
about almost 20 years ago now
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
and i started to hear almost instantly
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
from descendants of samson battis
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
all over the country and uh
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
and they said wow we didn't know this
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
story and then there's some in new
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire too and now they are very
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
active about
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
um i have a family organization and
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
about about these sites so you never
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
know you know
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
um that people might
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
might might might appear um but that's
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for such long answers on this
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
do this for a second time
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm thinking about our friend
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
in newmarket i guess there's uh
 
02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:47.110 align:start position:0%
in newmarket i guess there's uh
some

02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
some

event to uh to recognize him is it this
 
02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:53.349 align:start position:0%
event to uh to recognize him is it this
saturday

02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
i will turn it over to the
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative the honorable
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative from new market
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
wentworth chazwell another extraordinary
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%

my question is
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
in his case he was
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
half white and half
 
02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:15.589 align:start position:0%
half white and half
negro

02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
negro
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
he um
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
i i assume that he was
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
a post
 
02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.469 align:start position:0%
a post
slavery

02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
slavery
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
era but how about the other mulattos
 
02:18:28.479 --> 02:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
era but how about the other mulattos
who

02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:30.070 align:start position:0%
who
were

02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire at the time that
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
of slavery
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
possibly were not slaves themselves or
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
their descendants were slaves themselves
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned what happens to those that
 
02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
were partially indian native american
 
02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:48.549 align:start position:0%
were partially indian native american
[Music]

[Music]
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
can i put any finer point on it to make
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
well i mean i i understand your question
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you and um
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
i'll say we went with chess will he was
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
um free he was born
 
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
um free he was born
free

02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
as was and um
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
so there were free people of color
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire from a from relatively
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
early time for various
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
for various reasons
 
02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
for various reasons
um

02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:16.549 align:start position:0%
um
now

02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the reason says period of american
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
enslavement is that you might be a free
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
person of color at that time
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
but you were not you may not be what we
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
consider truly free
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are great restrictions on what
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
property you could own what kind of
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
education you get uh
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
well it's funny enough you could vote
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
for a little bit then you couldn't vote
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
you go to public school for a while but
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
then you couldn't
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the period of an american enslavement
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
there is a kind of an assumption in the
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
bill that the folks from that time
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
may not have had a free choices over
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
their lives in certain ways and their
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
grave sites might be
 
02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.309 align:start position:0%
grave sites might be
neglected

02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
02:19:52.319 --> 02:19:53.750 align:start position:0%
neglected
or

02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
or
unmarked

02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
unmarked
 
02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
unmarked
um

02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
now you this notion of you know well
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
you're kind of asking who's black and is
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
not right and um that that's such a
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
problematic aspect of our
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
history as americans right you know
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so i think that we have
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
kind of as we allow and census people
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
self-identify and i think we need to be
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
very respectful about whether we're
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
trying to legislate about how
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
black or how white or how indian or how
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
not indian you know what i'm saying so
 
02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
not indian you know what i'm saying so
i'm

02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just soon i'd be i haven't been
 
02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just soon i'd be i haven't been
silent

02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
silent
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
just now because i've talked but i'd i'd
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
much rather be silent on those kinds of
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
two finances personal issues
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
any any other questions by members of
 
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
the committee i have one
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh money
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's enough there is an fn on this
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't uh
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
is there a cost
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
to what we're to to what's
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
proposed well thanks for your question
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
um the fn was here i i crafted it
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
carefully to say that there was no no
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
new duty really or any i mean the um
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
cultural resources ben wilson others
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
they they supported the bill said we
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
could if we're asked to help this what
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
we do already will help so there's no
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
finance cost to them the potential here
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
is that anytime we pass a statute if
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
somebody violates it that's what the
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
physical note says well let's say
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
somebody violated this they went with a
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
backhoe and dug up a
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know an african-american burial
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
ground and um they would have violated
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the statute so
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
or let's say already 2026 that
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
this some collection has that fingerbone
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
necklace and they haven't dealt with it
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
yet that's
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
potentially violation so that's the
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
physical note said well but you know
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
like we often get well potentially a
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
violation how many cases will there be
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
will we have to prosecute or not who
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
knows as far as the cost of taking care
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
of these sites um there's a lot of
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
volunteer activity a lot of eagle scouts
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
um a lot of you know in the markers that
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
have been placed um in hancock and
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere recently
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um there is a fund and the black
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
heritage trail new hampshire has a fund
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
to place markers they cost about 1500
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
each we're paying for that
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
local events
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
new markets you're going to be hearing
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
the effort to
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
put a
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
new grave marker went with cheswell's
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
site to we have there's a state highway
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
marker there and there's a fund for that
 
02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
marker there and there's a fund for that
already

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so anyways i don't i don't see any
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
you should say yeah enforcement was also
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be part of that question but
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um just to to
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
carry on what uh representative renzula
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
said so what if somebody disturbs a uh
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh african-american
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
site now like you were talking about
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
with a digging up
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
the streets in portsmouth
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
what is
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
there are they're violating they're
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
already in violation right if they don't
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
take care of the
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
they're not yeah
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question dude process
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i mean this is this makes
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
no change to existing statute if your
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
backhoe hits something
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know and look a lot of these bare
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
grounds you get out in the woods and uh
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
the reason they're discovered there's no
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
wall there's no markers that somebody's
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
out there taking trees down or digging a
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
foundation whoops bones
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
so we we already have
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedures for all of that the work
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
stops the archaeologists the state
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
historical resources comes comes in and
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%

i may
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
i see
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%

senator waters covered just about
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
everything but i just want to say that i
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
um support this bill i understand the
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
importance of um
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
preserving burial grounds um i'm sort of
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
like a history um
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
amateur history buff um focusing on the
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
civil war and
 
02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh civil war um
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
veterans my
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
fourth great grandfather
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
was a civil war veteran and
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
