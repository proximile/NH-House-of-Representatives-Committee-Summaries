00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
electioneering it is actually quite
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
simple it's it wants to remove the
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
clothing uh part of
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
electioneering the reason is I went to
 
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.670 align:start position:0%
electioneering the reason is I went to
the

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
the
polls

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't even I don't even know if
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
it was a federal election or town
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
election I had a white hat one which
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
said something uh to the effect uh of
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
make America great and it had American
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
flag on it
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
um and I was asked to remove it by the
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
moderator uh that I believe infringed
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
Upon My First Amendment
 
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919 align:start position:0%
rights this is a First Amendment issue
 
00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.110 align:start position:0%
rights this is a First Amendment issue
to

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
me uh so I came up to this bill because
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
I looked up some information and I found
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
out that the US versus Minnesota
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
decision of the US Supreme Court on 614
 
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
decision of the US Supreme Court on 614
of

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
2018 by a 7-2 decision remove the
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
clothing uh PR prohibition from the
 
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.269 align:start position:0%
clothing uh PR prohibition from the
Minnesota

00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
Minnesota
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
statutes uh justice Roberts wrote
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
Minnesota had failed to articulate some
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
sensible basis for distinguishing what
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
may come in from what may stay out that
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
was one of
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
the uh findings that I found uh doing
 
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
the uh findings that I found uh doing
some

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
research and I'm going to keep this
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
short and simple and I'm going to close
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
with another chief justice Roberts quote
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
he wrote quote a rule whose Fair
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
endorsement requires an election judge
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
to maintain a mental index of the
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
platforms and positions of every
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
candidate and party on the ballot is not
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
responsible and thank you madam chair
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
for letting me bring this forward and uh
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
if I can answer questions I will if I
 
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
can't I am not a legal scholar in the
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
election law Arena thank you m Madam
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative do any
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
members in the Pres in the room have any
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative C Brian
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative pusin I I have a question
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
about the Minnesota law that youve
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
referenced is it possible that that law
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
was more vague than our law is and that
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
could be the issue they were they were
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
uh addressing specifically rather than
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
what we have here in New
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it potentially is a little
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit different when I came to write the
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
LSR I asked uh OSS to research the US
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
versus Minnesota decision and come up
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
with uh the verbage to change our uh RSA
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
and this is what they came up with based
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
upon that decision have that one I saw
 
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.990 align:start position:0%
upon that decision have that one I saw
that

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
one thank you further questions from
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
people in the room questions from
 
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.829 align:start position:0%
people in the room questions from
committee

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
Bergeron thank you Madame chairman uh
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative just a question I a quick
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
one I hope I understand uh the reasoning
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
for you're introducing this bill based
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
on your experience um however do you
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
think it would be appropriate for
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
representatives of candidates and
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
campaigns to dress up in a lot of uh
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
campaign promotional clothing and then
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
stand around inside the polling place
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
for uh an extended period of time uh
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
just just in in an effort to bring
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
campaign slogans into the polling
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
place uh thank you for the question
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
representative uh this does
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
not address the pole workers this only
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
address people who are walking in to
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
vote or walking out to vote it does has
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the folks standing
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
outside uh waving signs or people and
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
and typically it pro uh people are
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited from standing around inside
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
the polls by the moderator and the
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
moderator's assistance so um if I wore a
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
T-shirt and I went in to vote
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
uh that would be under this legal but if
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
I was standing around talking for a half
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
hour in in an observation area I this
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
would not uh would not be
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh this under this RSA I would be
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
asked to leave and it would be
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
justified thank you representative thank
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
you other members of the committee who
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.189 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any up representative K
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
Brian thank you madam
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
chair um M representative pus said could
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
it possibly be interpreted that PO
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
workers could wear these items if this
 
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.710 align:start position:0%
workers could wear these items if this
bill

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.990 align:start position:0%
bill
any

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
could such things
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
good I I don't believe that pole workers
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
are uh in this it states people who are
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
going into to
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
vote uh and pole workers would still be
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited uh from uh wearing political
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
clothing as well as the folks that are
 
00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:45.710 align:start position:0%
clothing as well as the folks that are
standing

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
standing
 
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.310 align:start position:0%
standing
outside

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
uh and actually in section 7 line
 
00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh and actually in section 7 line
16-9

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
16-9
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh it says that basically is prohibited
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
with no electioneering caror established
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
outside the polling place by the
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
moderator which means uh the entry way
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
has to be free the inside of the polling
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
area would still remain free of any
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
political except for the people who are
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to vote this this this bill is
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
only for
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
voters has nothing to do with the people
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
working the polls or watching the
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%

bill that refer only to that this
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:31.470 align:start position:0%
 
voters

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%

okay uh thank thank you for the question
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
line8 on uh I guess it's page one
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
provided that a person eligible to vote
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
or registered to vote in the voting
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
district who is unable to remove or
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
cover clothing that's what we're getting
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
rid of and
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
rid of and
they

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what I believe is the first
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment issue is that they are re
 
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.870 align:start position:0%
amendment issue is that they are re
restricting

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
you've struck the part that makes this
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
apply only to voters as I read it uh or
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
could you comment on whether this would
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
now apply to anyone in the polling place
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.350 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
this this is only meant voters it is not
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
meant for people working anywhere in or
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
around the polls uh and that's the way I

can

00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%

political

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
clothing uh thank you representative I'm
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
glad you brought out that distinction
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
when you go to vote you do not give up
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
your first Amendment rights but when you

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to spend some time at the polls
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
political clothing if you weree a
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
t-shirt you have to go change your
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
clothing while you are working because
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
you have to be politically neutral while
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
you are working the polls
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%

with them that this applies only to
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
voters and if not would you be willing
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill to make sure that this

against House Bill 87 from my
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
understanding the amendment to the

language within the statute only
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
addresses clothing or obvious parhelia
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a specific candidate party
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
or measure this mey mouth change would
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
not only create a new space for
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
political agitators but encourage it now
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
more than ever political tempers run hot
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
and emotions High I foresee this Chang
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
as a burden to our pole workers forcing
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
them to become Arbiters of a gutted RSA
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
during an election there is room within
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
the law for someone to express
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
themselves freely with limitation to
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
individuals questions or motions on the
 
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.470 align:start position:0%
individuals questions or motions on the
ballot

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment is
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary New Hampshire voters
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
understand this law as it is now and
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
they respect it having interacted and
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
enforced this irsa during those 12
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
elections myself in Derry in my capacity
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
as an election official people are quite
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and very few and far
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
between when asked voters remove the Hat
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
cover the shirt remove the button they
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
do so because they understand that they
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
are there to have their voices heard in
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
The Ballot Box not in the line to
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
receive a ballot and not inside the
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
polling location the bill does not even
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
address poll Watchers who are also
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
voters I don't want to I don't want our
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
free and Fair New Hampshire elections
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
being called into question because of
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
undue influence of a poll worker's
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
outfit or a voter's choice of political
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
underinformative

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
underinformative
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
Traditions I think we have all had
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
enough of grifters trying to call our
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
elections invalid in this state I do not
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
support turning our polling areas into
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
Billboards inciting tensions between
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
supporters inside such a meaningful
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
space either we take our elections
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
seriously or we invite potential chaos
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could benefit from
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
election reform but reform should happen
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
collectively within our elected
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
officials who actually oversee our
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
if the argument for this change of the
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill is solely for the empowerment of
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
one's Free Speech the bill does not go
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
far enough and if the argument is we
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to copy Minnesota New Hampshire is
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
unique and doesn't need to do
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
so we should consider the optic this
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
provides are inanimate objects
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
projecting vote for me more important
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
than the content of what a candidate
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
believes or in or says when they speak
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
does the bill cheapen the honor and
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
importance of a polling location at a
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
time in our country when people are
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
questioning our own
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
Integrity the circus of campaigning does
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
not belong folded into the respectful
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
place a polling location should be when
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
we go inside to vote we are not
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
Democrats or Republicans we're Americans
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're Patriots we're friends we're
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
neighbors and together we're exercising
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
Tina I am attempting to elevate you I
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%

conf hello can you hear me we can good
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
morning uh thank you very much um Madam
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
chairwoman uh I am Tina Guilford I am
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
the town moderator in Derry
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
um and I am speaking against this
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh the lack of
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia um keeps the sanctity of a
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
polling location and keeps anyone from
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
feeling that their vote is in any way
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
suppressed the most complaints that I
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
received from voters that had anything
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
to do with electioneering were that they
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
were on uncomfortable with candidates
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
yelling out comments to voters as they
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
pass the candidate
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
area um so this would be exacerbated
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
inside the polling place by any
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
candidates or their surrogates walking
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
in and out of the polling location or
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
standing in observation all decked out
 
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
standing in observation all decked out
for

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
hours um contrary to what um
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative pusk stated um that law
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
is not just for voters it's for anyone
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the polling place and while as a
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
moderator I can tell my poll workers and
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
instruct them that not only can they not
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
wear anything um I actually instructed
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
my poll workers that they couldn't roll
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
their eyes when in a primary somebody
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
selects a particular ballot because
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
that's not their
 
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.549 align:start position:0%
that's not their
party

00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
um this would be a very uncomfortable um
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
thing for most voters and the whole
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
point of Elections is for voters to feel
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.149 align:start position:0%
point of Elections is for voters to feel
free

00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
to ex exercise their unfettered right to
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
vote and they should do so in peace in a
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
contentious elections like the ones we
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
we just had um it would have required to
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
have more more pole workers and more of
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
a police presence than we already did um
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
just based on people's
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
behaviors and that would have just
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
driven up the price of the election even
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
more and I think most taxpayers are
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
tired of paying more for things
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
and while I understand that some voters
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
may love to show their support at the
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
end of the day everyone should be
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
comfortable when voting um in speaking
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the Minnesota law mentioned by rep
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
Tusk uh that law prohibited any and all
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
political verbage not just um tied to
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
who was on the
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
ballot um in prohibited campaign
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
material in New Hampshire includes the
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
following a vote for a candidate name or
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
party vote against a candidate name or
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
party to vote Yes on a question or vote
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
no on a question a picture of a
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
candidate a candidate's name or an
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
uncommon logo associated with a
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
candidate it's all tied to the
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
candidates that are on a particular
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
ballot um
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
so that's that was the issue with
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
commentary and that concludes my
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm prepared for any
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone on behalf thank
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%

clarification purposes as the moderator
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%

can do that for my pole workers but I
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do that for any
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
member of the public walking in
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
room representative PR O Brien I looked
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
right at you and you didn't raise your
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%

could you tell us uh and thank you for
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
coming today Miss Gilford could you tell
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
us uh how it has been when you in
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
general when you ask people to remove
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
the political attire that they're
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
wearing how reaction to them youever had
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
people that are um most of them are uh
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
very apologetic uh some people don't
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
realize um that it's actually a rule um
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
you have to remember sadly a lot of
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
Voters only vote once or twice every
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
four years um you know they don't come
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
out for elections on the regular uh so
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't really get a lot of push
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
back um in all the elections I've worked
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
and I've worked probably about 15
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
elections or so um I've had one voter
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
give me push back um about his hat um
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
I've asked we've had had to ask voters
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
to go in the restroom and turn their um
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
t-shirts inside out and and none of them
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
have said oh no I'm absolutely not doing
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
that um they're all apologetic I've had
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
voters put pieces of tape masking tape
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
over something so that they can come in
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
and vote um so most people definitely
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
understand thank you questions from
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.750 align:start position:0%
excuse me at a voting place I'm sorry
I'm

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
nervous um when I was working as the
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk this past year for
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
this election Maga was considered a nogo
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
but BLM was okay and we all know that
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
that was as significant for a party one
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
party over the other as magot is I'm
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
asking that rather than Muddy Waters and
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
frustrate voters who 99% of the time
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
just want to get in and out that you
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
leave clothing and buttons off the list
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
and clarify election earing as an
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
activity in which a person or person's
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
engage in by verbally speaking or
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
physically handing out information to a
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
prospective voter that seeks to persuade
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
how that person will vote I don't
 
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
see any reason we need to make this more
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
complicated than it needs to be poll
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
workers by definition have to be neutral
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
and that includes ballot clerks or um
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
moderators assistant moderators people
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
guiding somebody as to where to go to
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
vote but the person standing in line to
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
vote should not be prohibited from
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
wearing articles of clothing that
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
they've purchased that yes may speak of
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
a candidate but to me it's no more
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
offensive or um uncomfortable than
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
seeing somebody come through with a
 
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
skeleton and crossbow
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
or some excuse me some other religious
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
or political
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
or save the whales or anything like that
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
we can you can take freedom of speech
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
and try and squish it as much as you
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
want there's always somebody who is
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to be offended by something let's
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
get beyond that and let
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
people be free to speak how they wish to
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
speak without stepping on toes and
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
letting people do what they just came to
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
do thank you thank you does anybody in
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%

Nottingham um and you said that there
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
was an issue I'm assuming in Nottingham
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
um where BLM material was allowed but
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
magga material was not can you elaborate
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
on that well it was I'm not saying
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
specifically in Nottingham I was on on
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
because I worked as the deputy town
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
clerk during the election this
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
year I was on a zoom call with our ag
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
office and somebody asked the question
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
was BLM considered electioneering and
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember who it was but
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
somebody at the AG office said no BLM is
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay Maga is not because it's it's
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
specific to a candidate and I disagree
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
totally thank you further questions from

um thank you madam chair I'm David
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state um
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
here I i' just like to say on this bill
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that we believe that the area
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
inside the polling place and especially
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
inside the rail should be a politically
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
neutral place where a voter can go and
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
exercise their right to uh vote their
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
choices on the ballot uh without having
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
campaigns follow them into the you know
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
into the same
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
location specific to House Bill 87 I
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh to the law actually
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
does what the sponsors think it will do
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at line two uh the
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
definition of electioneering is there it
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
says electioneering means visibly
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
displaying or audibly disseminating
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
information that a reasonable person
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
would believe explicitly advocates for
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
or against any candidate political party
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
or measure being voted I think that
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
language would apply to political
 
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.109 align:start position:0%
language would apply to political
clothing

00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
clothing
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh whether uh that language is contained
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
starting on Section Five I'm sorry line
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
five of the bill or not that's that that
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
sentence simply starts by saying
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
electioneering includes but is not
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
limited to so I think just by removing
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
that language uh you are not saying that
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
it is okay to wear political clothing uh
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
inside the the polling place I think
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there would have to be affirmative
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
language specifically permitting that
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
for that to happen uh my recollection is
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
that this language that is uh being
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
struck uh in the bill was added to
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
actually help the moderators show a
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
voter wearing political clothing that
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
this is not permitted in the polling
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
place they could actually point to the
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
statute where it said that and so in
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
that regard it was a tool to help the
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
moderator uh let a voter clearly
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
understand that that was not permissible
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
so uh with that Madam chair I'd be happy
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions any questions
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%

excellent thank you good morning good
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
morning I will be extremely brief uh I
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
spent my first term uh in the election
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
law um so I have fond memories
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I sat or fortunately or
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I sat cross from
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ray Buckley at the time
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
and I watched him manipulate some of our
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
laws over the years and I don't like the
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
political advertising that goes on uh
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
both sides do it it's inappropriate and
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
citizenry doesn't like it and I'd like
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
us to start making some changes I have
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
emailed each one of you members a
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
advertisement from the Senate District
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
race and you know it just goes beyond
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
the pale here here criticizing people
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
for opposing things when they've never
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
been elected uh we're saying that your
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
friends are opposed to something and
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
trying to say that you actually will do
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh and I know every time
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
we go to the Attorney General's office
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
he well it's free speech it's political
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
speech we can say it uh I know this
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have uh much of a chance in your
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
committee but I wanted to make the point
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
that we have to start doing something
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
the way that both parties are putting
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
out mailings and literature when there
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
really it goes beyond Hal truths and
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
untruths and I'd appreciate if you would
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh make a stand and do something about
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
these things especially when someone has
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
never voted
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
before uh or been elected before and I
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
will be brief because I know you have a
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%

representative for the New Hampshire
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
Association of broadcasters this is a
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit group that since 1954 has
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
represented the TV and radio stations
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
located throughout our great state we
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
actually represent 98% of those who are
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
currently broadcasting news and
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
entertainment uh on the TV and radio
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
Airwaves throughout our state um I
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
completely uh respect and appreciate uh
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative infantine desire to uh
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
keep them honest if you will which is
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
what I quoted in um the the letter that
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
I submitted from uh Tracy Caruso who's
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
the executive director um I think one of
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we have here with
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
this conversation is that there is a
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
third rail at least when it comes to
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
broadcasters rules rights regulations
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and oversight we are regulated by the
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
Federal Communications Commission and
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to political advertising
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's for federal or state
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
candidates on TV or on radio the rules
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
are very strict uh and and they're
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
they're from our perspective they're
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
very clear that um if unless there is
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
something that is defamatory and action
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken on behalf of the other
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
campaign because there is something that
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
is absolutely um breaking the law in
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
terms of claims of the ads that they are
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
protected under Free Speech uh the
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative commented having been on
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
Election law committee before and all of
 
00:48:56.589 --> 00:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
you are very experienced with this you
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
would completely understand that this is
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
a challenging balance of allowing people
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
to express themselves versus trying to
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
referee and make sure that the claims
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
made are truthful and accurate um I
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
would just simply say that um from from
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
the perspective of this particular Bill
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
we would recommend that you uh find this
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to to legislate based on
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
both the Constitutional violation and
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
the very difficult and challenging route
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
by which you would have to
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
set up a review process and uh some kind
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
of Statewide practical um um
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
investigatory process that might also
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
run a foul of what the FCC rules are for
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
broadcast I I understand that the
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
representative brought forward a um an
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
example that was a mailer um so I and I
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
understand that the printed documents
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
and things that are mailed out may have
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
a different set of rules but at least
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
from the broadcasting perspective uh we
 
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask that the comp
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
applications that uh prevent any
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
practical application and the First
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment violations would just make
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh an inexpedient bill so we would
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you vote itl thank

structure there's the exploratory phase

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
election phase that runs from the day
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
after the primary to the state general
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
election if a candidate agrees to the
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
volunt to voluntarily limit their
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
expenditures they are limited According
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
to which office they are seeking as to
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
what they can spend but can raise $5,000
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
from a single Source in each period
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
totaling $155,000 over the course of the
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
entire cycle they can raise more per
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
Doner but they can spend less overall in
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
the campaign the amounts are written
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
into statute and do not increase cycle
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
to cycle to reflect the increased cost
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
of campaigns or operations as a
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
candidate if a candidate does not agree
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily limit their expenditures
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
they can spend as much as they like on
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
the effort but can only raise $1,000 in
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
theice primary and the $1,000 in the
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
general election since they cannot agree
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
or disagree to the expenditure limit
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
before they file their candidacy they
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
can raise $5,000 in the exploratory Cas
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
as a result candidates who don't agree
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the voluntary expenditure limit are
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
CA at raising $7,000 per donor per
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
complete 2-year cycle this is referred
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
to as the 5,000 plus 1,000 plus
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
1,000 most candidates for office do not
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
agree to the voluntary expenditure limit
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
thus most candidates fall under this
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
$7,000 per cycle per Dono limit the bill
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
before the committee today removes the
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary expenditure limit and the
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
exploratory phase from existing state
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
law and changes the limits per election
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
to $3,500 per donor this would maintain
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
the $7,000 per donor per cycle limit
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
that currently exists for those
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
candidates who do not voluntarily limit
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
their expenditures this move would
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the candidate filing form by
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
as the last column on the state filing
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork regarding the voluntary
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
expenditure limit would no longer be
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
necessary this would also streamline
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance report by only having
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
two periods of time the primary and the
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
general election according to our
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
purposes the primary phase would begin
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
when a candidate starts running for
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
office and the threshold to file with
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office would
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
remain unchanged at $500 raised or spent
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
per candidate committees and qual
 
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.990 align:start position:0%
per candidate committees and qual
organizations

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
this campaign Finance reform package
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
also contains two additional Provisions
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
in efforts to upgrade and modernize our
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance process currently
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
political organizations that are not
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
candidate committees commonly referred
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
to as taxs are allowed to raise $5,000
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
per election in the primary and in the
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
general so they can raise a total of
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per donor during a two-year
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
cycle this reform increases that limit
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
to10 000 per election or $20,000 per
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
cycle while Federal campaign Finance
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
operates on a yearly limit threshold of
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per year instead of per election
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
this change would put our state limits
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
for political organization fundraising
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
in line with the current federal limits
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
organizations that are focused on state
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
elections and issues taking place under
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
this Stone should not be expected to
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
operate at half the limit Federal
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
political organizations operate on by
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
increasing these limits we will put our
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
state laws more in line with Federal
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws lessening the
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
potential for confusion from political
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
organizers in the states the one final
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
change this legislation makes is is
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
truly an effort to clarify and reduce
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
confusion from firsttime candidates for
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
office currently uh as you're running
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
for office as all as all of us know uh
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
we can report our campaign finances as a
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
candidate or set up a candidates
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh this legislation removed
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
moves the candidate category from the
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
state campaign Finance laws and directs
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
every candidate filing campaign Finance
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
reports towards the candidates committee
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
registration process this would not
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
require more than one person to form the
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
committee a candidate for office in New
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can be both the committee
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
chair and the treasurer this would go to
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths to reduce confusion in the
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
process individuals today can go on to
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's website and
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
file as a candidate for the purpose of
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance for the the 2022
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
election declare what office they're
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
seeking and what party they're part of
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
the current setup of the law can give
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
the impression to firsttime candidates
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
that this process of filing as a
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
candidate for the purposes of campaign
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
Finance reports is the same as the
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
process for filing as a candidate with
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
their town or city cler during the
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
filing window that will be held next
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
June by directing all candidates to form
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
a candidates committee we will remove
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
potential confusion while reducing the
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
categories of entities for campaign fin
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
reports leading to Greater transparency
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
in a more cohesive system overall I know
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
I have just presented a great deal of
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
information regarding the propos
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and I did email all of the
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
members this morning a copy of my
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I'm happy at this
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
time to take any
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
Sweeny representative ter roian thank
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question so um you know I can
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
see some benefits to some of what you're
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
proposing in here but again can you
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more on the on
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
the reason to
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
change um in in in the spirit of trying
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
to keep it simple seems to me by um
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the ability for candidate
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
just to be a candidate not have to form
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
a committee would be better than getting
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
rid of that he has to now form a
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
committee so so tell me kind of what the
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
bit all the others um revisions aside
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
tell me how that's a benefit to to uh
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
to have have to re require everybody
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
that's running to now form a committee
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and the way I view it is
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
truly kind of just a bookkeeping measure
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh the process for registering a
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
candidate committee versus just
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
registering as a candidate um there's no
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
difference between that process there's
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
no cost to register a candidate
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
Committee in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
and this legislation doesn't introduce a
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
cost for that it's it's really just in
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
an effort to to move away from having
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
two different categories for how a
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
candidate files um it's just moving
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
everybody into a candidate committee I I
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
operate a candidate committee for my
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
election efforts I call it Joe Sween for
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm the chair and the
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
treasurer of it um and the process to
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
file as that is is as simple and
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
straightforward as just filing as a
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
candid so it doesn't change any of the
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements um it just makes
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
it so that it's it's it's called a
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee um and it's really just
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
merging my view the two entities
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
together one
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
candid thank you thank you
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative Brian thank you madam
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh we have a citizen legislature
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
in this state and that's a very positive
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
people are you concerned that some
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
people may be dissuaded from running for
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
office if they feel they uh
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
they have to form a committee where at
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
this point they are simply candidate but
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
now if they're a committee that doing
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing but they have to
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
call themselves a committee and it may
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
make things more complicated to some uh
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
people who are interested in serving the
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
state legisl um I I absolutely
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
understand that um and I think both
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
respective political parties in the
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
state will do everything they can to
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
ease that confusion with the potential
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
candidates that are looking to look for
 
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.150 align:start position:0%
candidates that are looking to look for
office

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think we're introducing
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
so much of a burden where the candidates
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they're planning on spending or
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
raising $500 toward their election
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
efforts are going to have to file Curr
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
anyways either as a candidate or as a
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
candidate committee um I understand the
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
word the wording that committee is is
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
the The Harbinger here I wouldn't be
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to just saying we'll have
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
everybody fil as a single entity as a
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
candidate um I just don't see the reason
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
to have candidate filings and candidates
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
committee filing when it's really just
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
one Avenue anyways and one vehicle for
 
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.549 align:start position:0%
one Avenue anyways and one vehicle for
people

01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
Ence thank you representative Ross um is
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
there any material difference outside of
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
the word committee between being a
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
candidate or actual difference you the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
fundraising limit different is the
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
spending limit different is the way you
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
Tak funds different anything different
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
other than the name uh to to my
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's no difference I I've
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
looked through in and out of the
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws that we have after
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
working in politics I don't see a
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
difference between filing as a candidate
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
and filing as a
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
candidate thank you representative
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
browan representative sweetie u i I
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
share a concern of making this more
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
complicated than necessary for uh
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
candidates State Rep uh I many of my
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
friends who rep work very hard to stay
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
under the $500 because they just don't
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
want the hassle of reping um 500 has
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
been in place at least since 2008 when I
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
got involved uh and I believe it was
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
before that you be receptive to adding
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
to your bill amendment to raise the 500
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
to, 1500 because let's face it
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
$1,500 is not a huge amount of political
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
influence in today's climate and it
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
would allow a much larger number of
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
people not to have to file at all which
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
would reduce the Secretary of State's
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
work reduce the candidates work and I I
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
think it would it would alleviate some
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
of the concerns about making this too
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
complicated for people who don't plan to
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
go raise a lot of
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
money thank you representative for the
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
question I I wouldn't see a problem with
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
that many legislation that the committee
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh were so motivated to to amend the the
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
legislation to that effect
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have opposition
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
for thank you representative to I'm
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to go to some members online first
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then come back to thank you madam
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
Lane yes thank you madam chair I have a
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
couple of questions um do you want me to
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
ask for follow-ups uh each time go ahead
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I I'm sorry I
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you go ahead
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lane without followup
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
permission okay all I might cut you off
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
after 20 or 30 minutes but well
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
hopefully will not take that long uh I
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
guess my question was why is this needed
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
to why is it why do we need to raise the
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
contribution limits to be consistent
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
with Federal in a state like New
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's small and local most of
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
these races are
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
local um so so I'll say so we we don't
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
raise the contribution limit for the
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
candidates we just allow them to raise
 
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.710 align:start position:0%
candidates we just allow them to raise
the

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
$7,000 more so throughout the election
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
cycle we raised the contribution this
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
bill raises the contribution limits for
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
political organizations uh just to just
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of progress our laws that update
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
update the current existing laws that
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
haven't been updated in in a while I'm
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
not sure when the $5,000 limit was set
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
into statute um but the cost of of
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns in between the the Republican
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
party and the Democrat Party just the
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
party committees um in 2020 I know the
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
Republicans have raised and spent on the
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
state side $1.7 million and the
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats have raised and spent $4.3
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
million um so there's definitely not a
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's not a lack of money in the
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
system currently going towards political
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state um but just
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
to up update the donor limit from 5,000
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
to 10,000 I think reflects the increased
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
cost of campaigning increased cost that
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
political organizations have in the
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
state um there are a number of political
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
operate 365 days a year both years of
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
the election cycle they not just set up
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
as a candidates committee would be just
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
during the election time they are
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
constantly raising money and constantly
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
making expenditures uh in efforts to uh
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
to win elections in the grandon state um
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
so I just think it's time in 2021 to
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
update the limits that was myself and
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
the other Bill sponsors to just update
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
the limits for p oration throughout the
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
gr State across the
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
board okay um also did I understand you
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
to say that you reducing the reporting
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
periods um in your bill so so not so
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be the same
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
schedule of when reports are due for
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reports uh but
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
currently uh when you file with the
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office you have an
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
exploratory phase that you report under
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
then you have the primary phase then the
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
general election phase and then the
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
reports under this bill the reports
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
would just have the primary election
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
period and the general election period
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
so there' only be two periods of on the
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
reports listed in the column that's
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's submitted to the Secretary of
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
State's office but this does not change
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
the schedule of reporting uh that's
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
statute and why why would you want to
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
reduce the to remove the exploratory
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
period where were there problem so just
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
the way that the the the the other
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill regarding candidate
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
filings moving it from that $5,000 that
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
someone can raise in the exploratory
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
base the $1,000 in the primary and the
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
$1,000 in the general that is changed to
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
the $3,500 in the primary and $3500 in
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
the general and there's no exploratory
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
phase under campaign Finance laws and
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
and and honestly the the current setup
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
is is great for protecting incumbents uh
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
because incumbents have all the time in
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
the world to raise those big dollars
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
from from donors early on in the cycle
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if you are and we don't really deal
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
with it running for state representative
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
but if you're running for state senate
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
or you're running for executive councel
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
um and you decide to a few weeks before
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
filing or a month before filing uh
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a massive drop off
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
in your ability to fund raise the moment
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
you sign up for office which I think is
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
is a bad uh practice under the current
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
law and allowing candidates to continue
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
to fund raise while they're
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
campaigning while while people are
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
paying attention on will benefit the
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
candidates and benefit the ERS in the
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
state so that they just it really gets
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
rid of that exploratory phase and the
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
minute you start raising money for a
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
campaign you're entered into the primary
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the campaign even without
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
filing for the
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
office okay thank
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
berron thank you madam chairman uh my
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
question goes back to the issue of
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
creating candidate committees and um
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
well I I recognize that there's actually
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
no difference in filing uh reports
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
whether you're a candidate or a
 
01:08:09.079 --> 01:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
whether you're a candidate or a
committee

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
um a lot of state representatives like
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
to separate their money so that they
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
have a separate account for example for
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
their campaign contributions when I
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
established a committee my bank required
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I get an employee identification
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
number in order to open up an account
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
under that committee's name um wouldn't
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
this bill create new hurdles for
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
candidates to set up accounts where they
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
can separate their campaign contribution
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
and expenditures from their personal
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
accounts um I I don't see any reason why
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
it would I think that that just depends
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the bank that the candidates using um
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
but I I don't see any reason why someone
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to form a candidate's
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
committee and still form file an account
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
using their social security number
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
existing account and just create another
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
account at their Bank um so I'm not
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
aware of a bank that would require um
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
but obviously it seems that in your
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
experience you have I know when I set up
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
my committee account uh as Citizens Bank
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
I just needed to provide my social um
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
but if that is if that is an actual
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue with with the committee process um
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
then I'm obvious open to the changes
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
with that to make sure that candidates
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to file with for banking
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
purposes um but I'm not aware fully that
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is the norm for banks or that Banks
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to create an account
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
or if you created a committee Paul
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
berson for for rep or for N I don't see
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
why Paul berson can't set up an account
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
for those funds um we
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
know unlike Federal Finance laws the
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
state newshire doesn't ask for what your
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
bank account information is or where you
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
do your banking campaign Finance
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
proportions um so I'm not sure if the
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
account name or or how the account is
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
filed to to segregate the funds from
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
personal accounts falls under campaign
 
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.270 align:start position:0%
personal accounts falls under campaign
Finance

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
La okay thank you
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
teros thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative for the uh additional
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
question so I heard you in testimony I'm
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to get back on the campaign versus
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
the committee there's no really material
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
difference or material benefit to change
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
that line would you be agreeable to an
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
amendment just to allow the candidate
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
the option to like it is now to be
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
either candidate or have a
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee um to the committee if that's
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
the committee wishes uh I will say the
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
the morphing candidates committee and C
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
filings into one entity uh was not the
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
the main force of this of this
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
legislation um I view it simply as
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the existing statute but
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
obviously as the as the committee wishes
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
to proceed the committee will proceed um
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
I I look at it as someone who has helped
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
candidates and firsttime candidates uh
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
before and feeled questions regarding
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
the differences between filing as a
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
candidate filing as the candidates
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
committee I I personally don't see a lot
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
of reasons to have the two separate
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
but if the committee so chooses I
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
definitely it's not going to be the part
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill that I'm going to fely Def
 
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.229 align:start position:0%
of the bill that I'm going to fely Def
thank

01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
you are there any other committee
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
members in the room representative home
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
o'ban thank you
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
chair this bill uh encompasses a few
 
01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
chair this bill uh encompasses a few
different

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
issues and I
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
I I feel like it it
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
they could stand alone in their own
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
bills one of them is repealing the the
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary expenditure
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
limits I've never really felt that I'm
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
affected by that
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um why does that affect can candidates
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
that choose not to engage with the volun
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
expend I just don't understand
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
feel wants to
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
try uh I I personally view the voluntary
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure limit as an outdated piece
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
of state law that was intended to reduce
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of money spent in our
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
elections and the number of candidates
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
that actually agree to the limits uh
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
proves that the amount of money that's
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
spent in our elections proves that the
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the law never really followed
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
through never effective um and I'm a fan
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
of updating and operating state law
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
wherever we can um and I just see a
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
cleaner system going forward would be
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
one without voluntary expenditure limits
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
um as it reduces confusion with
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
candidate filings and we've have both
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle had candidates in the
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
past that they're they're they're not
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
they're they know what they're running
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
for they know what they want to run for
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
and it's their first time running and
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
they'll agree to a voluntary expenditure
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
limit without knowing that they're
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
agreeing to a voluntary expenditure
 
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
limit and the impact that has not only
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
on their campaigns but on what others
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
are spending without without even
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
communicating with the candidates
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh creates headaches and I think it's
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's truly an outdated uh model to to
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
reduce campaign spending and I don't
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
think the state personally I don't think
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire should be
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
providing incentives to to reduce the
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
spending representative Ross the current
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary expenditure definition where
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
you can take effectively
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
$5,000 5,000 $15,000 from one donor that
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
system provide actually the the whole
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
point of campaign Finance laws right is
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
to prevent What's called the the gift
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
effect which is where you give somebody
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
something and human psychology dictates
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
that later that should be paid back
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that voluntary expenditure
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
level open that GI Dynamic up wider for
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
somebody that can stroke a $115,000
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
check versus somebody having to raise
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
smaller smaller contri students I I
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
agree completely I I view I view where
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
all candidates are tapped at the $7,000
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
per donor limit over the entire cycle
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
increases the importance of of smaller
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
donors um and also just makes it so that
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
candidates you know can't have that gift
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
effect that donations might to them and
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you I I VI campaign
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
Finance laws um we need to be able to
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
make them as transparent as possible and
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
as as willing for people to be able to
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
comply as possible um and I think the
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
changes this bill make it so that
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
candidates can can more easily comply
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
with all the pieces of campaign Finance
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
law and makes it and I know there's
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of things in the bill
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
but I do think this makes it a more
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined process and more explainable
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
process to firsttime candidates that
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
compliance further questions from
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee members in the room committee
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%

I'm representative cat McGee as you

before you here today as the prime
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 105 affectionately known
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
as the LLC loophole Bill U many of you
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
may remember this legislation from last
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
time around um New Hampshire campaign
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
Finance laws attempt to create some
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
controls that prohibit the UN undue
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
influence of money in politics and HB
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
105 helps to make that real this bill
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
reestablishes the intent of RSA 664
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
colon 4 um Section Five by ensuring that
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
the identity of a donor behind the LLC
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
is revealed before uh for political
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
contributions uh to prevent the current
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
loophole that permits multiples of the
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
campaign contribution limit from being
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
submitted by an individual donor who has
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
multiple llc's available to them as
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
members of election law I'm sure you're
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
interested in supporting transparency
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
and accountability where possible and
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan effort as it was in
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
the last session to plug the LLC
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
loophole for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
so a little background in 2010 there was
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
a gubernatorial candidate John Steven
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
who caused a stir when he raised over
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 from 30 limited liability
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
corporations registered from just two
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
addresses in the states of Massachusetts
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut and the donations ended
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
up uh being traced back to an LL uh I'm
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry an LLC that that uh represented
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
franchises uh 13 llc's using the same
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
addresses gave New Hampshire
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial candidate Kevin Smith
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
donations that went well beyond the
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
individual legal limit nearly $100,000
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
of Smith's contributions came from llc's
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
that were from those same addresses that
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
I mentioned uh in the prior example the
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
bundling of donations from the same
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
individual is clearly in con conflict
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
with the intent of the New Hampshire
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
contribution limit statute but nothing
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
in the current law prohibits multiple
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
limited liability companies controlled
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
by the same individual from donating the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
maximum on behalf of each
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
LLC uh to compound their influence
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
making it easy for these donors to flout
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the law and exceed the
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
statutory individual limits so uh my
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
Republican co-sponsors on hb1 5
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives gay and Gunther were
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
happy to sign on again they had been
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors in the prior session um and
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
I am not sure whether they're online
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
because we can't see who who's waiting
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
um to speak to you today but I would
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your vote in uh ought to pass
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
to fix this loophole to protect the
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire from the unfair
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
use of our campaign Finance laws by the
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Brazen few thank you for your time and
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions if I if I
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
can answer them I will
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss mcke from committee
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
members in the room representative Ross
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes do Union have this same sort of
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
as you call it loophole and do they ever
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
use it as do they take money in from
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
members and then redistribute candidates
 
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
underneath their own
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
name I I you know I think it's a good
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
question and the way I would view this
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
is that this is a fairly narrow cast
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't solve every every
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance violation or every
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
Brazen act uh that could be identified
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's specifically targeted to look
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the abuse uh from the LLC perspective
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not sure that any of the
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
unions are set up that way I think that
 
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
would go more into you know packs and
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
other ways that people organize in order
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
to bundle money so I understand the
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
point of your question but I think this
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
is distinct from that and and if someone
 
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
else has a different perspective I'm
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
happy to hear it but I I actually think
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
this is just specifically targeted to
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 664 colon 4 on how LLC contributions
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
handled um which is that there is a
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
limit that is set by legislation and
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
that that limit is now being
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
um you know averted by folks who are
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
figuring out ways around the
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
limit um cross Paul you said that going
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
back to my first question about
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
specifically you said it's distinct and
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
different but how is it distinct and
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
different how is it not the exact same
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
thing I think if a union is set up as an
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
LLC then it would fall under this
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
particular legislation and I'm not sure
 
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
that unions are set up that way so
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
distinction thank you further questions
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee in the
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
room I thought I I hand over here see
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%

2019 of the 2020 gubinatorial candidates
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
for six months this is important six
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
month period of June 6th to uh 2019 to
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
December 4th 2019 shows that llc's were
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
used extensively in the 2020 campaign
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
cycle to funnel money above that $7,000
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%

documents via email to you all um along
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
with a spreadsheet that I'm going to
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
reference um while I speak the data took
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
three days to assemble uh because of our
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
state's archaic Reporting System the LLC
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
data had to First be keyed into a
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet because it was submitted by
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
facts sorted by addresses and names and
 
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
then the O LLC ownership identified
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
through corporate records not exactly a
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%

five different llc's from the using the

Joseph Pharaoh owner of Tuscan Kitchen

and a developer was one of the most
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to track down having llc's in
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
two states that donated uh Mr Pharaoh
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%

Michael Kane and John Kane used a
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
similar tactic to Brady Sullivan using U
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh four corporate addresses um all with
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
it uh as an example 162 Corporate Drive

donated increments of $5,000 for a total
of

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
$25,000 there are more but I'll spare
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
you it's bad enough that corporations
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
are making direct donations to
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
candidates in our state something which
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
has been out louded now in many states
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
um but to have these individuals
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
bamboozle the spirit of our campaign
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
Finance laws is really insulting I'll
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
end my testimony the way I began the New
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire personal contribution limit to
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
a candidate in the state election is
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
$7,000 please vote ought to pass on HB
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
105 thank you very much for your
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anybody in the room
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
who has the question representative
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
sweee thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question um and
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
this may have some follow-ups do you
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
believe that business owners uh in the
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
granted state are affected uh by the
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
outcome of elections in the granted
 
01:27:07.719 --> 01:27:12.430 align:start position:0%
outcome of elections in the granted
State

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
certainly if if if those same business
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
owners have multiple businesses and each
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
business is recognized separately as an
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
LLC as its own
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
why would we limit those businesses that
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
may have interests and may have skin in
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
the game if you will from making their
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
voice heard through their political
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
contributions why would their free
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
speech they have a h a personal limit of
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
$7,000 uh as it is currently the
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
statute per personally but we allow we
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
currently allow the we currently allow
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
llc's to to meet those personal limits
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
as well um and this bill changes that
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to wrap my head as
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
to why we would limit the the political
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
speech of those of those entities well
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the entities are are owned by those
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
individuals so this bill uh an LLC
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any political speech I'm
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm asking onea if you can please
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
mute you were you have been recognized
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
and spoken and are not part of the
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
discussion at this point thank you I'm

right representative ter Roan thank you
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you sir for taking my
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
question you're still there certainly I
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
think we all agree there's lots of money
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
in in campaigns these days and the
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
numbers going up uh there many types of
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
doners and donations
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
for for comparison purposes could you
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
give similar figures to the players you
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
just mentioned for monies um in
 
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
donations from trade unions in the state
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
or perhaps even out of the state well
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
there is a another bill before you today
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
which addresses uh uh the donations
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
coming from corporations and trade
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
unions specifically uh trade unions are
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
not part of this bill so um it it's it's
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
about a portioning this bill is about
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
apportioning uh the uh the percentage of
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
ownership in the llc's toward a uh a a
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
personal donor's
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
total so uh if you own uh a 20% share of
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
that LLC that's making the donation that
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
amount would be go to your personal uh
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
donation total but it does not involve
 
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.910 align:start position:0%
donation total but it does not involve
trade

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
trade
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
unions thank you representative Mooney
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you for your testimony
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
I apprciate all of the examples that you
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
gave I'm wondering if you could further
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
break down some of the examples or any
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
example you gave as applicable to the
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
formula in the bill for example in the
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
case of Tusk kitchen you mentioned all
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
the llc's and so forth with a total
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
approv of
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
35,000 if uh that LLC
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
scenario was applied to this law what
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
would be the outcome based on the LLC Lo
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
on access to this information is very
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
difficult um so as I said it's not a
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
transparent system and when I did this
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
research I can see who are stockholders
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
U or owners in these corporations but I
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
do not have the uh tools
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to identify what
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
percentage they have follow
 
01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
LLC thank you very much well then I have
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
a followup thank you if you're not able
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
to see the percentage of ownership in
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.510 align:start position:0%
to see the percentage of ownership in
the

01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
implemented I would you'd have to
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
disclose this information uh you'd be
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
asking the
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
requiring the uh owners of these llc's
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
making the donations what the percentage
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
of their ownership is in that LLC
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
currently if you look at the reports
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see individuals that make
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
donations have to disclose their
 
01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:40.270 align:start position:0%
donations have to disclose their
business

01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
affiliations right so that that would be
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh an additional step that that L
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
that llc's would have to do so you'll
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
see on the leftand side of the campaign
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
Finance reports of the candidates you'll
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
see names of individuals but then you'll
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
see names of Corporations and uh names
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
of llc's names of unions if that's
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
applicable um uh and you'll see those
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
and then you would want to dis have
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
another column that would disclose what
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
the percentage of that ownership was in
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
the L in in an L LLC so part of my
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
process was to go through and match up
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
the individuals with those llc's but I
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
you'd have to require that
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ross question chairman um
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
you're here with the open democracy
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
which you say is a nonpartisan group
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh I work uh in in this capacity
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm uh representing open democracy
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
action which is a 501c C4 I assume it's
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
democracy right um is there a single
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
member of your board who is not a
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
Democrat uh is that drum main to this uh
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%

the election on helping everybody to
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%

testimony that you're nonpartisan but
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with your board and and I
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%

speak Madam chair um I sent you written
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of this bill as one
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
small step for campaign Finance reform
 
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
and in that I pointed out that a similar
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
Bill SB
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
156 passed both the house and the senate
 
01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.910 align:start position:0%
156 passed both the house and the senate
in

01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
2019 uh unfortunately it was one of the
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
57 bills vetoed by the governor that
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
year but there was strong bipartisan
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
support for this bill in 2019 and I
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
would ask you to look at it today after
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
I sent my written testimony I wanted to
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
do a bit more research not as
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
extensively as Mr Beal succeeded in
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
doing however but I did I was curious
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
about how many
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
llc's there are that are primarily
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
single member
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
llc's and how many are entity owned and
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
I found an article in the new Hampshire
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
Business review of September 29th
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
2019 this was an article written by John
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
Cunningham Esquire who is an LLC legal
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
expert in our state and he wrote there
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
are tens of thousands of New Hampshire
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
llc's that's that's disturbing if you
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh I realize they're not
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
mostly set up for campaign donations but
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
if the single owners of those llc's
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to donate and create you know
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
even more of these single member llc's
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
they could do it so this bill puts a bit
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
of a break on that uh llc's have
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
certainly other uses they need to be
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
used and so on oops I'm sorry you're
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
seeing my ceiling I just realized I
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
apologize for that I was going to ask
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
you to to to move your camera but I'm
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
not sure in the zoom World whether
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's considered good etiquette or not
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
so you know maybe it was not good
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
etiquette of me to have it aimed at the
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
ceiling so I
 
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
apologize um but in addition to those
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of single member
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
llc's there are hundreds of thousands of
 
01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
entity owned single member
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
llc's and um I'm sure if Mr Cunningham
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
could explain exactly what that means it
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be interesting but the point I
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
wish to make is that this could have a
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
huge impact if people want to circumvent
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
our very sensible campaign Finance
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
reforms uh Finance laws by using the
 
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
llc's without this law that you're
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%

01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%

remotely thank you Miss tenerelli I I do
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%

longstanding and I can't remember when

01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
Voters you're talking about New
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right yes I am and so has the
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire your executive director
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
has the has the New Hampshire board
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually met to vote on the things that
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
you appeared before us on or not
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
actually I am the President I am a
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer I am elected by the board and
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
the uh board does meet not to vote on
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
specific bills as this is but rather we
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
work from a set of positions that have
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
been adopted over the years through a
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
process of study and
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
consensus uh llc's are a very specific
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
part of this but the nation league has
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
done a study on campaign Finance
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
reforms which the state League uh is uh
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
supports and so it is on that basis that
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
I am speaking for our state league and
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
actually the national league would would
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
support this as well but uh I I am not
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
speaking for them
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%

I am speaking as president of that
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
organization yes in which all members
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
have a voice in developing those
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
positions and then they are formally
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
adopted by the board in order to use in
 
01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:10.599 align:start position:0%

takeback a republic the leading
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
conservative organization nationally
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
working on campaign uh political reform
 
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
in general and campaign money reform a
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
little tiny bit of background I'm former
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
state senator republican from the Upper
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
Valley area I live in Hanover in Etna I
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
am former chairman of the Hampshire GOP
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
platform committee served on two
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
separate legislatively authorized
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
campaign money commissions which have
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
wrestled with these and and many issues
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the campaign money
 
01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
associated with the campaign money
reform

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
reform
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh I have uh run for governor as a
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
republican for US Senate twice as a
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
republican so I've got quite a bit of
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
experience also senior a political
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
adviser for Gordon Humphrey when he ran
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
for governor as a republican in the
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
primary for New Hampshire so I've got a
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
lot of different types of experience
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with campaign money issues both
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
as a candidate as an adviser and as a as
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
a volunteer in organizations so again
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
there are just two points I'd like to
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
make in favor of the out to pass motion
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
here on this bill is the the general
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
value of campaign money limits and the
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh the need to close what really here is
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
a specifically identified gaping
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
loophole in the money limits we have
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so first the value
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
of limits and I know many conservatives
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
like myself uh support the citizens
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
united decision which uh forbid limits
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
in many types of expending but
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized and supported
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
direct to candidate contribution limits
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
so one one of the bedrocks of
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
conservative thinking about campaign
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
money is the 2010 citizens united
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
decision it specifically authorized
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
condoned both transparency reporting so
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
that people know where the money is
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
coming from and direct to candidate uh
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
contribution limits so this bill is very
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with with the conservative
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
Bedrock of of thinking about campaign
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
money uh the value of limits uh I go
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
back to the framers of our constitution
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
they were keenly deeply concerned about
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
two things one of which was the prospect
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
of tyranny when you concentrate power as
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
large sums of money spent on individual
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
candidates tends to do uh it tends to
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
increase risk of tyranny concentration
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
of power abuse of power and secondly
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
risks of corruption the founders framer
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
of our framers of our US Constitution
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
thought very very carefully about
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
dispersing power when you allow when you
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
allow large sums of money I.E through
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
this LLC loophole uh concentrated uh
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
sources of money to flow to a specific
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
candidate you increase the risk of
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
corruption and you uh increase the risk
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
of undue influence uh our government is
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
structured specifically structured to
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
keep influence broad because we have a
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
government uh thought by by one of our
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
framers Madison to be accountable solely
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
to the citizens the people of the
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
country in this case the constituents of
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
a person in New Hampshire who might be a
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
candidate for for New Hampshire office
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
so by having limits we disperse
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
influence and we reduce risk of
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
corruption we reduce risk of
 
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
concentration of power and and and the
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
risk of tyranny secondly just it it's
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
fairly obvious this this bill doesn't
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
seek to correct every single means by
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
which uh campaign money can be
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
concentrated into into one hand and
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
thereby increase influence on a
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
particular candidate but this is a known
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
identified loophole it can be closed
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
simply it's a simple short Bill uh
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
therefore I uh urge a to pass thank you
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%

01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair first of all I'd like to
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
welcome my old friend Senator Rubin back
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
legislature we miss him around here I
 
01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.189 align:start position:0%
legislature we miss him around here I
think

01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
lots of times I would I would like to
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
ask you Senator what particular uh
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
abuses you see the LLC process
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
particularly um evidencing in in this
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
area I I'm not going to ask you about
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
how your
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
organization uh what your organization's
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking process is thank you
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah both organizations take back our
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
Republic again the leading conservative
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
organization focused on campaign reform
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
political reform and American promise
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
another National Organization I whose
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
board I sit see the value as is evident
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
in Hampshire's campaign law in
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
dispersing power in in making sure that
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh individual members of our legislature
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
our governor our members of our
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
executive Council are accountable to all
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
their constituents on a broad basis
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
again that the the theory here and I'm
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
not going to identify any specific
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
instance of corruption I don't know of
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
any specific in in in in instance I'm
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a very strong supporter myself of
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
Republicans I give money to Republicans
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
I strongly support our governor however
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
there is a risk when you allow a single
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
individual to concentrate large sums of
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
money in the form of a contribution to a
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
particular candidate and that
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
candidate comes into office that
 
01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.790 align:start position:0%
candidate comes into office that
particular

01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
voice that donor voice is Amplified and
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
the risk of that is that the broad range
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
of citizens constituents that that that
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
candidate that member of the legislature
 
01:45:59.310 --> 01:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
Governor executive Council represents
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
might be uh might be silent suppressed
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
less listened to so what we're doing is
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating risk this is
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
completely consistent with campaign
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
Finance law in New Hampshire very
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with citizens united which
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
sees value in dispersing power this is
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
completely consistent with our framers
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
and founders structuring of the
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution to make sure that we don't
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
have concentrated power and that we make
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
sure that government is accountable
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
solely to to the people in this case to
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
constituents so this is deeply
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with fundamental conservative
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
values the structure of our government
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
at the state and federal level I don't
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
know if that answers your question or
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
not thank you it does thank
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
you however I will Senator Rubin with
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
your permission ask and follow up
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative Cody having reminded me
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
committee members do not have the
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
advantage of the the signup sheet which
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
I have which has individuals signed up
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
as representing an organization but
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
speaking as a member of the public so
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Rubin if you could clarify you
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
signed up as representing American
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
promise um but are identified as a
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
member of the public so in what capacity
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
are you appearing here this morning
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
like the like the last question right
 
01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
both American promise and uh and
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
takeback our Republic have not examined
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but both
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
organizations uh support limits to
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
individual contributions to candidate
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
and this loophole in our state law
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
allows essentially unlimited
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
contributions controlled by and sourced
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
from a single individual so so the
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
loophole in our state law is uh totally
 
01:47:53.229 --> 01:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with the primary mission of
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
two organizations that I that I work
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
with so just for my further
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
clarification um is it fair to say that
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
you're a volunteer member of those
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
organizations then which is why you're
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
not appearing as a lobbyist in both case
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not paid not paid anything to do
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
you representative representative Sweeny
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
you uh Senator Rubin for taking my
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
question um so just off of off of Madam
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
chair's question uh so you are here
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
today representing multiple
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
entities correct followup representative
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
s would you say those multiple entities
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
have their own political economy in in
 
01:48:38.239 --> 01:48:39.870 align:start position:0%
have their own political economy in in
their

01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
operations you mean are they dependent
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
on sources of money that flow to
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
them uh
 
01:48:52.589 --> 01:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
I I can say an answer to that you know
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
reflecting on the on the last question
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%

105 and depending on when I speak you

will have heard or are yet to hear uh in
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
great detail the current legal abuses of
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
money in politics that tilt political
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
influence heavily in favor of the
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
wealthy under current law one person
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
owning multiple llc's May leverage his
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
or her campaign
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
contributions by the number of llc's
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
that one person owns like Jerry
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
mandering political power shifts away
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
from segments of the
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
population because state legislatures or
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
in this case gubernatorial veto have
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
allowed for unfair advantage to
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
perpetuate it's akin to the early
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
discussion in America's history about
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
the right to vote that only wealthy land
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
owners be given the
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
franchise the Brennan senate for justice
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
confirms that over the decades quote the
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court as well as lower courts
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
have repeatedly and consistently upheld
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws requiring
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
disclosures of who is spending money in
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
politics end quote in the citizens
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
united ruling
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
and otherwise Goliath ruling against
 
01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
David the majority concluded
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
transparency is key to democracy quoting
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
quote transparency enables the
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
electorate to make informed decisions
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
and give proper weight to different
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
speakers and messages end quote in the
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
case of the LLC Le blue pole the public
 
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
is not being informed as to who is
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
influencing our elections instead only
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
being informed as to the entity making
 
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
being informed as to the entity making
those

01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
contributions thus doubly offensive to
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
democracy one individual making multiple
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
campaign contribution through ownership
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
of multiple
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
llc's and then LLC members making
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
anonymously HB 105 is before you today
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
because Governor sununu vetoed the
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
previous version in referring to the
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
Minority Report on SB
 
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
156 whose language is identical to this
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill I respectfully disagree with this
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion that elimination of the LLC
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
loophole would prove harmful to the PRI
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
privacy of LLC members I remind all who
 
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
serve in the legislature that you are
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
required to disclose all donations over
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
$25 including the names
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
addresses and
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
occupations of those donors contrasted
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
with current law allowing hundreds or
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to be contributed
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
to campaigns without attribution to
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
laws there is no justification for the
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
elevation of political influence by
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
those wealthy enough to knowingly
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
disadvantage the rest of us in the

01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
however every justification for
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
supporting uh for support of filling in
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%

of the committee I'm David scanland
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state here not to
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
take a position uh on House Bill 105 but
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
to point out that both this bill and the
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
one prior probably should have been uh
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
sent out for a fiscal note um I can tell
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
you that some programming changes would
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
be required to our online campaign
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
Finance system to accommodate the
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
changes in both bills um I would also
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
point out that uh the Attorney General's
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
office would probably see increased uh
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement expenses in terms of uh what
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be required of them to look into
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh members of llc's to make sure that
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%

01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
in any contributions that the LLC makes
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%

previously done can we look at those um
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
or or did we neglect to do it last time
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
too uh representative L I would have to
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
go back and look uh to see if they were
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
done last time and also see if the if
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bills are identical or if there are
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
know at least settle differences between
 
01:56:38.239 --> 01:56:39.790 align:start position:0%
know at least settle differences between
the

01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
two and may I have a followup
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
please go ahead sure my understanding
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
deput scandin is and I haven't seen it
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
but I had understood that there was a
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill pending that might require
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure of LLC members is that
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
correct do you know uh I don't know I'd
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to look it but I'm not aware of
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
that this session but it's not to say it
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist yes somebody asked me to
 
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor it and I don't know what
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
happened so maybe they decided not to to
 
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
go forward thank you probably have gone
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
to Commerce if it made it through the
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment process
 
01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll check it out thank you all
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
questions all right not seeing any I'm
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
GNA close um the hearing this morning on
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
HB 105 and that brings us to our next
 
01:57:39.069 --> 01:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
noticed hearing um which would be hp91
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
but that is not noticed till 1:00 so we
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
have an unexpected long lunch break um I
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
will in the in the interest of sort of
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
going forward here I have extreme
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
interest in getting our first bill exact
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
today and it seems to me that 127 would
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
be a perfect Bill to do it um so uh
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps at the end of the day if if
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
members could take a look at that bill
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
and the testimony we received this
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
morning which was to itl it uh perhaps
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
we can address it thank you and we're on
 
01:58:25.069 --> 01:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%

political

03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
political
 
03:27:53.229 --> 03:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
committees um and I have asked
 
03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny to introduce the
 
03:28:02.429 --> 03:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
swe thank you m chair members of this
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee I am not a sponsor on this
 
03:28:10.349 --> 03:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
legislation but I am introducing it this
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill as you
 
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
says increases the dollar threshold for
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
reporting by phot committees currently
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law is individual
 
03:28:23.469 --> 03:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
gives $25 or more to a political
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
organization or a candidate in the
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
stampare their name and address is
 
03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
publicized on the campaign Finance
 
03:28:33.630 --> 03:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
reports uh this bill would increase that
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
threshold to
 
03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
$100 uh committee research indicated
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the last time that the dollar
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
amount was changed was
 
03:28:44.110 --> 03:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
1982 um so roughly this is really just
 
03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
keeping up with inflation and the
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
changes cost of what $25 was in 1982
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
would be around $100 today um and I
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
would just like to the members of the
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee keep in mind that currently
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
for federal campaign Finance laws uh
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
individual donors are not reported uh
 
03:29:04.030 --> 03:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
itemized receipts unless they donate
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
more than $200 towards any particular
 
03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:10.359 align:start position:0%

03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:21.640 align:start position:0%

representative re thank you madam
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um for the record my name is
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 17 the
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
towns of newfields and New Market um
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is a housekeeping measure um
 
03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
and it actually pass the house if my
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
memory serves it was one of mine that
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
was on consent last year and
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was one of the very many
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
casualties of the Senate inaction due to
 
03:44:24.070 --> 03:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
covid so here it is again um for some
 
03:44:28.149 --> 03:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
historical context um n in 1907 then
 
03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
president Teddy Roosevelt signed into
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
law the Tillman act which remains in
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
effect today this bans all corporate
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
donations to um political campaigns on
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
the Federal level around that same time
 
03:44:44.189 --> 03:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also as you know State
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
races are separate from federal uh New
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had also banned uh corporate
 
03:44:50.670 --> 03:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
donations to political campaigns in the
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and that law
 
03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
stood until the New Hampshire Supreme
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
Court case in 1999 Kennedy V
 
03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
Gardner and the uh Supreme Court struck
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
down the law because it had been overly
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
Broad and most of my hopefully very
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
brief testim testimony will be quoting
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
that case report that Kennedy V Gardner
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
case so just so you understand why they
 
03:45:19.030 --> 03:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
Struck it down it the language was Broad
 
03:45:22.269 --> 03:45:22.279 align:start position:0%
and banned all types of contributions
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
from corporations but there are
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
essentially two ways of Corporation can
 
03:45:28.910 --> 03:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh can contribute one through their
 
03:45:30.910 --> 03:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
General funds this is the and just to
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
quote the case uh report generally
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
corporate political contributions come
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
from two different sources one is the
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
corporation's operating or treasury
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
accounts money in that type of account
 
03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
is derived from corporate business
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
activities such as the sale of goods and
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
services or the sale of corporate stock
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
it is generally accepted that a
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
corporation's ability to amass such
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
funds reflects its business Acumen but
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
not popular support or even the support
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
of shareholders for its political views
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
and they actually cite yet another case
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh which I won't go go to the metal
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
level of citing yet another case um the
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
other potential Source the the court
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
report uh
 
03:46:12.189 --> 03:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
continues of corporate political
 
03:46:14.830 --> 03:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
contributions is quote segregated
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
account typically segregated accounts
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
are funded by contributions solicited
 
03:46:20.429 --> 03:46:20.439 align:start position:0%
from corporate officers directors
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
employees and shareholders these
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
accounts also represent corporate money
 
03:46:26.189 --> 03:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
but money that does reflect some degree
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
of popular support for the corporation's
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
political goals and ideas so in other
 
03:46:34.149 --> 03:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
words um the court case in 1999 the
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was saying um while we
 
03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
support the idea that Corporation can
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
give donations through a segregated fund
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
where the Monies to that fund come
 
03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
specifically from donations for
 
03:46:50.349 --> 03:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
political purposes something we know now
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
as a pack um the idea that we had had
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
longstanding and long-standing law that
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
in general corporations shouldn't donate
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
from their general fund they supported
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
the problem was the language was overly
 
03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
broad weirdly when New Hampshire uh put
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
a ban on unions uh making political
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
contributions they did make that
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
distinction they said that from the
 
03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
general fund which is what do Do's
 
03:47:19.469 --> 03:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
paying members pay unions cannot make
 
03:47:21.149 --> 03:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
any contributions but if they have a
 
03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
separate fund known as a pack whereby
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
members donate specifically for that
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
political purpose then that is okay so
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
in 1999 the Supreme Court actually when
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
they struck this down they said and this
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
is again in the report there is of
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
course a simple solution to this simple
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
problem the general court can easily and
 
03:47:43.870 --> 03:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
effectively amend the statute to reflect
 
03:47:47.110 --> 03:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
its actual constitutional intent so the
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
court made it really clear that they
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
were only striking down the idea of it
 
03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
of its inability a corporation's
 
03:47:56.670 --> 03:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
inability to donate from it a segregated
 
03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
fund but that if we simply got more
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
specific in the law and made a
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
distinction between segregated funds and
 
03:48:06.189 --> 03:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
general funds then in fact that
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
longstanding law and in fact the the law
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the land on the Federal level would
 
03:48:13.469 --> 03:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
be completely constitutional
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the legislature simply
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
removed the entire segment referring to
 
03:48:20.550 --> 03:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
corporations and what that did is that
 
03:48:23.309 --> 03:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
while that distinction is still in place
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
for unions um and other organizations I
 
03:48:30.070 --> 03:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
presume uh where by a an organization
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
can donate from a segregated fund but
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
not from the general fund They removed
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
it completely for corporations meaning
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
any kind of donation from a corporation
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire hampire is
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay so all this does is it uses that
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
same language to make that distinction
 
03:48:50.189 --> 03:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
um per the Court's suggestion so that
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
from segregated funds uh corporate
 
03:48:55.149 --> 03:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
donations are fine as long as it's that
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
separated fund what we know is a pack
 
03:49:00.510 --> 03:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
and then General funds that come from as
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the Supreme Court said business
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
Acumen from selling goods and services
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
where customers are not necessarily
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
supporting necessarily the political uh
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
goals of corporation that those
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
donations would be illegal um as had
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
been the law of the land for about a 100
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
years prior and is still the law of the
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
land on the federal level and with that
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll take
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Reed
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
room representative Hayward thank you
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
mad chair thank you representative for
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
question you have spelled out in this uh
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
two types of
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
organizations but by only spelling out
 
03:49:51.550 --> 03:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
specifically two types of
 
03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
exclude other types of organizations
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
which are not a business or not a
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
union thank you so much for the question
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
my goal in this was not to create new
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
law my goal was simply to clarify the
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
law that had been existing up until
 
03:50:17.030 --> 03:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
1999 and uh and do as the Supreme Court
 
03:50:18.750 --> 03:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
had suggested to to keep with the
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
original intent but keep the language
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
itself specific enough as to be
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional so I did not create any
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
new organization categories that don't
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
already exist in
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
03:50:36.510 --> 03:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
members further questions from committee
 
03:50:43.469 --> 03:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
electronically I'm not seeing any
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative Reed I do have a question
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
was this your bill HB 1643 last year
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
does that ring a bell uh I would not be
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
surprised I don't have the number in my
 
03:50:58.149 --> 03:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
head as to which bill it was last year
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
but that that may that sounds like it
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
could be correct I just wanted to see if
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
I might refresh your recollection
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
because I thought you said that this
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously last year I believe
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
the bill was HB
 
03:51:13.469 --> 03:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
1643 and the committee vote was 13-7
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
does that sound right uh that may very
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
well be the case Madam chair I don't
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
believe I said it passed unanimously I
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
thought it might have been the one one
 
03:51:24.269 --> 03:51:24.279 align:start position:0%
of my bills there were a few I think
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
five or six that were on consent and I
 
03:51:28.229 --> 03:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
thought it might have been one of those
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
but if I trust the the chair's
 
03:51:33.790 --> 03:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
recollection on the issue thank you any
 
03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:36.590 align:start position:0%
recollection on the issue thank you any
further

03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%

thank you for uh this opportunity to
 
03:52:14.429 --> 03:52:14.439 align:start position:0%
speak in support of HB 465 I'll try to
 
03:52:18.750 --> 03:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
be very brief the citizens united
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
decision although it acknowledged that
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
corporations are not really people uh
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
nevertheless awarded to corporations uh
 
03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
the right to spend as much money as they
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
cared to uh on political campaigns in
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
other words they could have as much free
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
speech as they chose to buy
 
03:52:44.189 --> 03:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh but a corporation per se cannot speak
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have vocal cords it doesn't
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
have breath it doesn't have hands to
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
type a memo so who then speaks for the
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
corporation you hear the voice of a
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
corporation who is
 
03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:00.389 align:start position:0%
corporation who is
speaking

03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
03:53:00.399 --> 03:53:02.149 align:start position:0%
speaking
shareholders

03:53:02.149 --> 03:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
shareholders
 
03:53:04.469 --> 03:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
no it is
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
the small cluster of men and occasional
 
03:53:08.399 --> 03:53:09.469 align:start position:0%
the small cluster of men and occasional
women

03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
women
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
boardroom and the Executive Suite who
 
03:53:16.510 --> 03:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
make those decisions for the
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
corporation but they don't have to spend
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
their own money because they have the
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
keys to the treasure chest the
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
corporations general fund General
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
treasury whatever it is
 
03:53:30.159 --> 03:53:32.670 align:start position:0%
treasury whatever it is
called

03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
called
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh we can in fact create and this is the
 
03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
desire of HP 465 a separate fund to
 
03:53:48.030 --> 03:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
which the corporation or the individual
 
03:53:48.040 --> 03:53:49.590 align:start position:0%
which the corporation or the individual
owners

03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
owners
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
employees friends can
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
contribute and from which then uh
 
03:54:01.389 --> 03:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
political activity can emerge
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
supporting candidates or political
 
03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
issues uh that is the intent as I
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand it anyway of HP
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
465 it would give a lot of
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
people uh who currently have basically
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
no say in what the corporation
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
supports some
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
voice and that in in its entirety is I
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
think something that we need to support
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to have in
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
place again thank thank you for your
 
03:54:43.990 --> 03:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
Mr are there any members of the
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee here at room who have
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Bagshaw representative
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
Barry uh yes thank you for your
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I have a quick question for
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
you uh you made a point in your hearing
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
that these corporations are that the
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
leadership of these corporations are
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
effectively speaking for let's call
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
their employees or their shareholders
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to to make it
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
basically that the select few you say
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
men and occasionally few women are
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
making decisions for the whole body so
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
unions operate very similar to this uh
 
03:55:20.429 --> 03:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
should this bill not be amended to
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
include a ban on unions as well of
 
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
course in fact I would say that it
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.550 --> 03:55:35.560 align:start position:0%

03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc executive director for open
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
democracy action and I am a registered
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist of a nonpartisan nonprofit and
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
I'm um C zooming in here today from my
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
home in
 
03:56:29.590 --> 03:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
Franklin um we are very concerned at
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
open democracy about the transparency of
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
campaign funds um as representative Reed
 
03:56:42.030 --> 03:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
told you the court case struck this
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
piece of the law down in
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
1999 but the court also told us how to
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
fix it and this uh Bill House Bill
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
465 is basically the the court cas's
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation on how to fix it um to
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative Barry's question labor
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
unions are already prohibited in the
 
03:57:07.710 --> 03:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
statute as well as limited liability
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
Partnerships are prohibited
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
contributions so this also adds
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
corporate corporate treasury um to this
 
03:57:19.790 --> 03:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
so this is a good idea because one it
 
03:57:22.110 --> 03:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
was the new H it was the
 
03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
law um and two we have these
 
03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on labor unions and on um
 
03:57:30.120 --> 03:57:31.349 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on labor unions and on um
corporate

03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
corporate
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
partnership uh or organizations
 
03:57:33.479 --> 03:57:34.710 align:start position:0%
partnership uh or organizations
registered

03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
registered
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
as as
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
Partnerships uh in the written testimony
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
I submitted yesterday um you will see
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
from an nhpr story of 28 campaign
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
contributions that over half of the
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
donations that are um were raised in the
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
2018 election of state senators um
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
accounted for by registered lobbyists
 
03:58:04.110 --> 03:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
these were corporate entities that were
 
03:58:07.309 --> 03:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
um lobbying on behalf of these laws um
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I did speak to to some of those and
 
03:58:11.469 --> 03:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
they said oh we would love this
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
corporate ban um this this ban exists in
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
24 States I want to give um this
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee an example of where we see New
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire exploiting this corporate
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
loophole um the New Hampshire Democratic
 
03:58:31.389 --> 03:58:31.399 align:start position:0%
party takes money from Colorado
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
corporations Colorado has a ban on their
 
03:58:35.080 --> 03:58:36.229 align:start position:0%
corporations Colorado has a ban on their
um

03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
contributions and then they the Colorado
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
corporations donate to the New Hampshire
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
Democratic party and the New Hampshire
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
Democratic party sends that corporate
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
money back um to Colorado I think they
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
do probably take a percentage of it um
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
but I think it's really important that
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
we do not allow that kind of money
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
laundering and we close this important
 
03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
loophole um it's really important that
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
everyday citizens feel like they can
 
03:59:06.670 --> 03:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
participate in our political and
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
campaign system and know that the rules
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
are rigged and this is a first step in
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
fixing our campaign Finance system so I
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote a to pass on House Bill
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
465 and fix this important loophole and
 
03:59:23.550 --> 03:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%

Anita Burrows and I represent Bartlett
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
Jackson and Harts location um this bill
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
um came before the municipal committee
 
04:01:29.070 --> 04:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh last year um my my my recollection is
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
it went through it passed 17 to3 and was
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
one of the bills way laid um because of
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
the covid crisis um the purpose of this
 
04:01:41.070 --> 04:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
bill um is to better clarify what we
 
04:01:43.630 --> 04:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
have a murky line that exists between
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
personal and political campaign
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures and I'm not going to read
 
04:01:49.750 --> 04:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I think and I think we
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
have seen some abuse in the past of um
 
04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
of from both sides of the party of
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
people using campaign expenditures for
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
personal items such as for flowers for
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
birthdays funerals and office gifts auto
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
repairs um com Chamber of Commerce
 
04:02:08.710 --> 04:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
memberships dry Clan
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
gas unrelated to a campaign and uh there
 
04:02:14.269 --> 04:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
was a contribution to the governor's
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
inauguration and I think that the reason
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
that this is troublesome is that um I'm
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
sure many of us have contributions in
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
our own campaigns of 10 to $2 or more
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
and these are these are this is money
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
from hardworking people who have who
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
specifically are donating money for the
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of a candidate getting elected
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
they did not intend that money to be
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
used utilized for personal expenses and
 
04:02:43.510 --> 04:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
I I think the root cause of this problem
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
is the fact that um New Hampshire uh
 
04:02:48.510 --> 04:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
state legislators are pay so paid so
 
04:02:52.110 --> 04:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
little but the answer is not to abuse
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
campaign um expenditures in my opinion
 
04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a different issue uh I have an
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
exp I live two hours away 4H hour round
 
04:03:02.670 --> 04:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
trip I knew when I signed up that I
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
would have Hotel expenses um my husband
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
and I agreed that that was something we
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
would incur and um I do not expect my
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
constituents to pay for that hotel room
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
um after an election so um um the real
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
law as it is written now is does not it
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
does not define uh what what a personal
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
expense is um and federal law states
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
that uses the
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
um uses oh what is it uses the
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
irrespective test which is is a good
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
test which says a personal use is any
 
04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
use of funds in a in the campaign
 
04:03:43.710 --> 04:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
account of a campaign to fill a
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
commitment um that would exist
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
irrespective of a candidate's campaign
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
or responsibilities as an office holder
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
but our state law does not delineate
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
what a personal uh what a personal
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
expense is now I know that there was um
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the last time around in Municipal
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
there was some concern about what some
 
04:04:05.550 --> 04:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
people categorize as the laundry list of
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
things that that this law would cover um
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
I if the committee would be more
 
04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable in categorizing those
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
expenses um in a certain way I would be
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that um um because I
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
think it's just important that we just
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
basically set a limit on what the
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures can and cannot be used for
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
um this particular law was based on a
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
law set in Utah um which they also
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
delineate the um the authorized and
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited use of campaign funds um
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
other states have chosen to to do
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
individual things like um Louisiana um
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
says that you cannot repay personal
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
contributions or loans um Hawaii says
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
that um you can't donate excessive funds
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
um for charitable or scholarship P
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
purposes before an election date um I
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
think it's just you know however this is
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
done I just think it's important that we
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
make clear to legislators what what they
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
can and can't do for with this money so
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess I will stop there and I will
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative McDonald
 
04:05:17.309 --> 04:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and good
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative buros um I was
 
04:05:23.149 --> 04:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
just curious as to what prompted this is
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
did a constituent or a donor reach out
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
to you or is it something that that you
 
04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
just found troubling and you decided to
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
do this through your own perspective um
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
I actually became no it was not a
 
04:05:37.870 --> 04:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
constituent I became aware of this issue
 
04:05:39.630 --> 04:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
when I was running for office for the
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
first time in 2018 there was actually an
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
actually an article act the article
 
04:05:45.870 --> 04:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
might have come out in
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
2017 um about campaign Finance
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures and it concerned me um I
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually then went through the uh uh I I
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
did a random search of campaign
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure reports from both sides of
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
the aisle and the examples I gave um in
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
in my testimony are actual items that I
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
found list
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
so people were reporting on these things
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
um but they you know were were they were
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
reporting on them they weren't trying to
 
04:06:18.910 --> 04:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
hide them but I think I found them to be
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
Troublesome um in terms of what the
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
intended use of the contributions were
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
and um so that that was the um that was
 
04:06:31.149 --> 04:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
the origin of it thank you thank you
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%

representative beerus for the question
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
your legislation in includes a list of
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
of prohibited items but it's not limited
 
04:06:45.550 --> 04:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
to um including uh the first one is rent
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
utilities um meal expenses uh would you
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
believe that some campaigns for for
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
state senate executive Council Governor
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
that are governed by these laws uh pay
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
rent and utilities for campaign offices
 
04:07:02.189 --> 04:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
and and have meal expenses for staffers
 
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
that are on those campaigns and would
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
that all be affected by your proposed
 
04:07:06.720 --> 04:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
that all be affected by your proposed
legislation

04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:07:12.030 --> 04:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I I I think your Point's well taken
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it um I think the point the um the
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
the if the if the language isn't clear
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
it can be tightened up the purpose of
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
this that these are not personal
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
expenses that are used just for um an
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
individual um I uh it is not it is not
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
meant to um to interfere with paying
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures thank you questions from
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%

delighted to appear before your
 
04:08:48.319 --> 04:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
delighted to appear before your
committee

04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
again um and it's strongly in support of
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
this measure representative Burrows um
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a first termer did some
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
incredibly sophisticated research and
 
04:09:09.309 --> 04:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
worked very hard uh on this bill and
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
then as was the fate of so many bills
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
last term um it um it disappeared um
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
having been attacked by the virus it's
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
back now and I think quite healthy and
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
something that I believe is very much in
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
keeping with how New Hampshire goes
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
about um conducting our
 
04:09:41.710 --> 04:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
elections uh we uh require people uh to
 
04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
um list their um uh the money that comes
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
in uh and that g that gives them a lot
 
04:09:53.950 --> 04:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
of flexibility as long as they do that
 
04:09:56.309 --> 04:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's just as we're allowed to vote on so
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
many issues as long as we declare in
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
advance what the conflict is but this is
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
a way that the legislature can honor um
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
its institutional commitment to the
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and in making sure
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
that when citizens who are people make
 
04:10:21.389 --> 04:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
contributions to a political campaign
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
the money is used for that purpose I'm
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
sorry that I could not um hear which
 
04:10:31.229 --> 04:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
member of the committee asked a question
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
of Representative Burrows um at the end
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
of her testimony but in I'd like to
 
04:10:36.800 --> 04:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
of her testimony but in I'd like to
respond

04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
respond
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
a little further to that question um on
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh the first page line 20 it says no
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure or use of a contribution
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
tangible or intangible shall be made for
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
a purpose that primarily furthers a
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
personal interest of a candidate or
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
officeholder or a candidates or office
 
04:11:06.670 --> 04:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
holders family which interest is not
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
connected with the performance of an
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
activity um and then it goes on and
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's where it lists mortgage rents and
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
utilities so if the uh payment for rent
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
or utility is for the campaign then that
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
is a perfectly appropriate expenditure
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
it is not appropriate if it is being
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
used um to substitute money that had
 
04:11:35.790 --> 04:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
been contributed to the campaign for the
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
personal benefit of the candidate so I I
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
think that um a careful reading of the
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
language uh would show that uh
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Burrow's draft addresses
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
that very question and I um hope that
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
you will see this as a way to
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
better um honor our obligations to the
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state without in any
 
04:12:10.349 --> 04:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate way restricting the
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
freedom of the candidate and I urge you
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
to support um this bill and I am pleased
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%

04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
problem seeing things apparently
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
today so representative Schulz thank you
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
for joining us welcome thank you madam
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the election law
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
committee it's an honor to be here with
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
you today to introduce HB
 
04:14:12.319 --> 04:14:14.149 align:start position:0%
you today to introduce HB
489

04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
489
 
04:14:17.309 --> 04:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
um just want to outline at the
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
outset what the real purpose of this uh
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
or the intention behind this bill is
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
because just seeing the $10,000 limit
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
isn't uh enough
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
information um under current law if one
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
is say a governor of a state and decides
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
to say run for US senate or congress
 
04:14:45.550 --> 04:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
there is a law forbidding a transfer of
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
that money from a state campaign to a
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
new federal pack uh Campaign Committee
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
to then use for the election to federal
 
04:14:57.560 --> 04:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
to then use for the election to federal
office

04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately there is no limit on a
 
04:15:03.920 --> 04:15:04.910 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately there is no limit on a
war

04:15:04.910 --> 04:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
war
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
chest uh from State funds to the state
 
04:15:13.389 --> 04:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
party apparatus and it's a backdoor way
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
that gets around the intention of the
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
federal law to allow an existing War
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
chest at the state level to be used to
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
State parties for running for federal
 
04:15:30.189 --> 04:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
office um I have a a problem with that
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the intention of this bill is
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we should be Dr
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
with our laws to not allow State funds
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
to be used by the party to allow then
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
promotion of a candidate to a federal
 
04:15:48.159 --> 04:15:49.210 align:start position:0%
promotion of a candidate to a federal
office

04:15:49.210 --> 04:15:49.220 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:15:49.220 --> 04:15:50.309 align:start position:0%
office
[Music]

04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
um uh that's the essence of the bill um
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
being able to transfer this money I
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
think gives an undue advantage in
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
federal elections I'm also not naive to
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
the composition of this committee
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps if this sitting Governor were
 
04:16:11.710 --> 04:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
say a former Governor Shaheen or former
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassen who then perhaps were
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
running for US Senate maybe the chances
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
for this would be better um so I'm not
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
naive but I do think that um it
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed regardless of party
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to take a hefty War chest and
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
use it for your purposes of running just
 
04:16:37.389 --> 04:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
under the moniker
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the nhdp or
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
nhgop um so there's the reason for the
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill it does allow some transfer it
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't forbid it uh it just limits it
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a fair
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
approach and I think it is a reasonable
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
solution that brings our state laws um
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
into alignment with the purpose of what
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
the federal law says one can do with the
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
state War chess for federal office
 
04:17:15.389 --> 04:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
directly uh that's the bill I couldn't
 
04:17:18.189 --> 04:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
make it any more complicated than
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
Schultz I I don't know what the
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
prospects are but you shouldn't be so
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
dismal the election law just had a
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote on something so yay great
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
happen this this turn questions for
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schulz from committee
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
online representative Schultz can I just
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
ask a question so does this presume that
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
a party segregates the funds that it
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
takes in that's a great question I'm
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually happen to be the former um
 
04:18:02.109 --> 04:18:02.119 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
Democratic party myself uh as far as I
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
know there there are no efforts
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
to um there may be separate accounts
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
that the parties may use for various
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
purposes but I am not aware of any
 
04:18:20.760 --> 04:18:22.269 align:start position:0%
purposes but I am not aware of any
specific

04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
divisions set aside to specify for
 
04:18:28.030 --> 04:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
federal elections on that on that level
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
so that's that is a good question and a
 
04:18:30.159 --> 04:18:31.790 align:start position:0%
so that's that is a good question and a
good

04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
this would prohibit the transfer even if
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
the candidate from whom the war chest is
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
being used from transferring the money
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
even if they had no intention nor ever
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
correct and I believe that is also the
 
04:18:58.159 --> 04:18:59.309 align:start position:0%
correct and I believe that is also the
federal

04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:19:02.429 --> 04:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
law that and I'll double check but I'm
 
04:19:05.469 --> 04:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that that is also a federal
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
law um um if one is closing an account
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
because they're not pursuing
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
reelection okay thank you any followup
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
questions or further questions from Comm
 
04:19:19.630 --> 04:19:19.640 align:start position:0%

04:19:19.640 --> 04:19:21.830 align:start position:0%

hearing at 2 o'clock is HB 468 relative
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
to the definition of a political
 
04:27:34.750 --> 04:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization the prime sponsor
 
04:27:37.469 --> 04:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
on this bill is representative Lane of
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
our own committee representative Lane
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
welcome thank
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
you um for the record I am
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative Connie Lane and I
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
represent the voters of marac 12 which
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
is war two in
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
conquer um HB 468 is a campaign finance
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill that lowers the current threshold
 
04:28:04.389 --> 04:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
for filing a disclosure from
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to2
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
$500 and clarifies what type of
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
communication qualifies for disclosure
 
04:28:14.189 --> 04:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
those of us who've been on the committee
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
it looks very
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
familiar I'll go through that in a
 
04:28:19.710 --> 04:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
minute the goal is to make the
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures by political uh committees
 
04:28:25.469 --> 04:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
more transparent um whether they
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
advocate for an an issue or for a
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
candidate uh it is virtually identical
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
to SB 106 which was passed unanimously
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
by the Senate
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and then passed this committee
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
unanimously it passed by Voice vote in
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
the Full House that year uh but then was
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
vetoed by governor cunu and was not
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
overridden the bill also passed um last
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
year uh in this committee and uh passed
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
the house by roll call vote
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when it went over to the
 
04:29:01.710 --> 04:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
Senate it got caught up in all the covid
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
stuff and it was tabled so being
 
04:29:04.960 --> 04:29:06.389 align:start position:0%
stuff and it was tabled so being
persistent

04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
persistent
 
04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh we filed it once again hoping that
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
this time uh we'll get it passed and uh
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
the governor will agree with us that it
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
is important for transparency in
 
04:29:15.359 --> 04:29:16.469 align:start position:0%
is important for transparency in
campaign

04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
finance and uh with that um I'll take
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
any questions but I know that there'll
 
04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
be some speakers who can probably answer
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
them a little bit better than I and um
 
04:29:27.000 --> 04:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
them a little bit better than I and um
that's

04:29:27.990 --> 04:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%

04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
American promise on Whose board I sit
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and take back our Republic which is the
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
nation's leading conservative campaign
 
04:30:22.199 --> 04:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
nation's leading conservative campaign
reform

04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
reform
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
organization and I urge this committee
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
to uh pass this bill with an aut toass
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation but I have a minor
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion as to uh adjusting the
 
04:30:36.269 --> 04:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
language in the last sentence uh before
 
04:30:38.910 --> 04:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
I get to that uh reasons for supporting
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
this this basically would help close a
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
loophole another loophole in the
 
04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
transparency of our state laws with
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
respect to campaign financing it's a
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
good thing a very good principle
 
04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
according to most conservatives that
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
voters know where the money comes from
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
it reduces uh perception of corruption
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
reduces potential corruption and uh more
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
information is generally better in
 
04:31:07.229 --> 04:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
government than less information
 
04:31:09.870 --> 04:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
and there is a loophole here and it it
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
can be used to game methods by which
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
money is inserted into campaigns and so
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a law where you can
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
game the system by taking a dollar and
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
moving it from place a or route conduit
 
04:31:25.830 --> 04:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
a to conduit B in order to alter
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
reporting and information to uh to to
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the public that that type of loophole
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
that that can be gamed should be closed
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh in order to make things simpler and
 
04:31:34.880 --> 04:31:36.910 align:start position:0%
uh in order to make things simpler and
clearer

04:31:36.910 --> 04:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh as to the last sentence there I'll
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
just read it it it says in this
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph expenditures do not include
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
expense expenses for candidate forums
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to spending
 
04:31:51.469 --> 04:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
for advertisements marketing or event
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
expenses I I see that sentence as a
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
former legislator as being a place where
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
there'd be ambiguity unclarity and again
 
04:32:00.910 --> 04:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
the potential for
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
gaming for reporting so again I hope
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to uh
 
04:32:09.510 --> 04:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh suggest this bill as ought to pass
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time members of
 
04:32:12.429 --> 04:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
the committee and Madam
 
04:32:16.429 --> 04:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%

Rubin from committee

04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay Olivia zinc has signed up to speak
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um chairwoman Griffin and
 
04:33:14.910 --> 04:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Olivia zinc and I'm the
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy and
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit in conquered and I
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
am here to speak on behalf of of
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
supporting aop pass on this important
 
04:33:32.590 --> 04:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure bill um it's really important
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
that voters know who's making political
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
speech and that everyone who is spending
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
money to influence New Hampshire's laws
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh vote New Hampshire's elections
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
register and
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
Report um this bill creates transparency
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
when it comes to independent
 
04:33:53.070 --> 04:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures and electioneering
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
communication um I and EC's most people
 
04:33:58.750 --> 04:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
think of those those as pack spending
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
but independent expenditures are
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
political campaign contributions that
 
04:34:08.109 --> 04:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
expressly advocate for the defeat of a
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
candidate um or a clearly identified
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
candidate and this bill strikes the
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
words functionally equivalent to express
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
advocacy which are are words that are in
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
the federal um campaign rules and really
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
makes it a very important clarification
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
that if you name a candidate and you are
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
mailing to people in that District
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of an election that you
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
must register and and report this does
 
04:34:39.551 --> 04:34:39.561 align:start position:0%
not stop anyone from making political
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
contributions or or making political
 
04:34:45.629 --> 04:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
speech it just requires them to register
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
and Report with the Secretary of State
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
just like any other packs
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
and um groups do we have collected mail
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
over the years and seen groups on the
 
04:35:00.189 --> 04:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
left and on the right who have um use
 
04:35:00.199 --> 04:35:01.349 align:start position:0%
left and on the right who have um use
this

04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
loophole to um not register and report
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's important that voters have
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
that transparency for an electoral
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
process to be open and fair it must um
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
be known and and we need to know who is
 
04:35:21.789 --> 04:35:21.799 align:start position:0%
uh trying to influence our
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
elections with that I'm happy to take
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
any questions about the background on
 
04:35:30.029 --> 04:35:30.039 align:start position:0%
this bill um I have been working on
 
04:35:30.039 --> 04:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
this bill um I have been working on
disclosure

04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
legislation I think since 2012 here in
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
New New Hampshire um and so happy to to
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anyone is
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about disclosure
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
rules questions from committee members
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
online Miss zinc I'm I'm going to ask a
 
04:35:55.230 --> 04:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
question because I know you're very
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
familiar with this legislation we heard
 
04:35:59.551 --> 04:35:59.561 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills this morning talking
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
about campaign expenditures where the
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
argument has been these limits were set
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
a long time time ago we need to get with
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
the times for cost so they're proposing
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
increasing of limits or amounts this
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
actually proposes decrease by a large
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
amount by half 5,000 to
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
2500 the amount that would trigger this
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
requirement to register um could you
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
explain to me what the logic would be in
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing the
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
amount um so original proposed by
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley was the $5,000 amount in
 
04:36:42.789 --> 04:36:42.799 align:start position:0%
his um legislation on
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
20224 when um Senate Bill 106 was being
 
04:36:50.910 --> 04:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
negotiated there was a committee
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
Amendment um by the senate election law
 
04:36:55.629 --> 04:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
committee which I believe was a 5-0
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee that they thought that in
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing that threshold um to
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
$2,500 I think in if I was spending so
 
04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
this this would require me if I
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
said Barbara Griffin loves to ride
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
horses and I sent out this beautiful
 
04:37:15.629 --> 04:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
piece of mail right before the election
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
that you're such a great person because
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
you love to ride horses to go toown
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
voters as a you know I wouldn't use
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
those magic words vote for or vote
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
against but if you're spending money
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
with a clearly named candidate within
 
04:37:34.349 --> 04:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
that narrow period of time um because
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
it's in that narrow period of 60 days
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the election they decrease that
 
04:37:41.470 --> 04:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
threshold because
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
$2,500 can go a long way in a small race
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I get that in the gorial race
 
04:37:52.590 --> 04:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
spending $2,500 on digital ads might not
 
04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
have an A A same effect as it would on a
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
house race but I think that's the
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
committee's prerogative if the committee
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
does not want to strike that language
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's it is your bill in your in your
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
hands and if you want to keep the $5,000
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
threshold but then um close the
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
loophole to ensure that anyone spending

Madame mayor
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
so if I read this correctly then if the
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
distribution is made outside of 60 days
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
the five the $2,500 amount doesn't apply
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
then correct if you if you if you spent
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
money right now
 
04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
um with a clearly identified candidate
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%

Moore
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%

04:39:55.470 --> 04:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
welcome okay okay I don't know what
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
happened there we're all working through
 
04:39:59.230 --> 04:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
some new technology uh for the record my
 
04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
name is Greg Moore and I am the state
 
04:40:03.310 --> 04:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I'm here today to
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to House Bill
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
468 uh the there are four reasons
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally why we oppose this
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
legislation the first of which is the
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
obvious uh constitutional defect that
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
would likely mean that this legislation
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
were to pass would not be enforced by
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice uh I earlier
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
today I sent to the members of the
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee a uh letter from then attorney
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
general McDonald to then Senate
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
President Donna suusi relative to
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
another section of of RSA
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
664 and however the the con
 
04:40:43.070 --> 04:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues that were raised
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
in that letter apply just as equally to
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation I'd encourage
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
you to read uh particularly page two uh
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
as the department of Department of
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
Justice rights the uh the uh any as it
 
04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
relates to first amend First Amendment
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
protections and and I do appreciate by
 
04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
the way the members of the committee
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
texting me to let me know that I'm that
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
that I was lost for a second thank you
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
guys uh and and ladies uh I want to I I
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
want to point out that uh that in the
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
letter the Department of Justice clearly
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
writes that uh anything that that
 
04:41:19.230 --> 04:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
requires disclosure needs to be in their
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
words well tailored and uh the
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
definition of entities or organizations
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
as they state in a letter to uh to sen
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
former Senate President Susi are not
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
well tailored meaning that they're over
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
Brad and uh and fundamentally they they
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
identify that as one and then they also
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
view uh these these broad definitions as
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
not not in Conformity of the due process
 
04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
clause of the Constitution uh so I think
 
04:41:48.430 --> 04:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
we could all agree that and I'd
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to read the letter
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
that I sent to the committee uh I think
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that that passing laws
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
that won't be enforced really is of no
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
value and so what I I would strongly
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to reach out to
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice and ask if
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
they similarly would not intend to
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
enforce this legislation due to
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional defects so that would be
 
04:42:09.788 --> 04:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
the first issue that I I think is most
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
critical and obviously represents a huge
 
04:42:14.590 --> 04:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
component as as to whether or not this
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill makes any sense
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever secondar secondarily uh there
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
were two rulings by the uh Department of
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
Justice in April of 2019 relative to
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
complaints filed uh against plan Planned
 
04:42:29.788 --> 04:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
Parenthood that really clarified a lot
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the rules regarding potential
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
electioneering Communications and one of
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
the things we saw in the 2020 cycle was
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
a near absolute uh absolute um use of of
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh moving towards Express advocacy by by
 
04:42:48.030 --> 04:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
a number of groups as a result of the
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
clarifications from from those election
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
election law complaints that came out in
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
April of 2019 so uh in in the second
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
instance I would say that as a result of
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
that I I think that this legislation is
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
probably a solution in SE of a problem
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
given the fact that I think that now
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
that we have that guidance from the
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I think you'll
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
see organizations use express advocacy
 
04:43:13.628 --> 04:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
uh the third third issue and this is
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
real a real problem is that it makes an
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
assumption this bill makes an assumption
 
04:43:19.150 --> 04:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
that any
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
Communications within 60 days of a
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
primary or 60 days or a general are
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
designed to be an electioneer in
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
Communications however we know that
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the case we know that there
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
are things that happen at the state
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
level of government within 60 days of a
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
primary or 60 days of a General those
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
things include veto override votes those
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
things include uh nominations and
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
contracts that come before the executive
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
Council those things include back in
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
2018 a special session relative to the
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
Wayfair decision these are all important
 
04:43:53.430 --> 04:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
issues that that organizations and and
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
entities might want to opine on relative
 
04:43:58.990 --> 04:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
to the importance uh to themselves their
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
and their community so the broad
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
assumption that any any activity that
 
04:44:06.030 --> 04:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
mentions the name of a candidate within
 
04:44:07.868 --> 04:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
60 days of a primary or 60 days of a
 
04:44:10.390 --> 04:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
general is automatically an election
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
year in communication is an overb
 
04:44:15.550 --> 04:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
assumption and then the fourth big issue
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
is is what this would impact outside of
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the public realm so for example if
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
Market Basket were opening a new store
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
and they had a ribbon cutting that
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
happened to include the governor state
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislators and they put that photo on
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
their flyer then they likely would have
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
to register or they would have to
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
register were this bill to become law
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
and be enforced they would have to
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
register as a political advocacy
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
organization because they would have
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
used the likeness of of a candidate for
 
04:44:45.868 --> 04:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
office and spent money behind that so I
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone has any intention
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
of including including something like
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
that in this in this type of uh law and
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly uh as the Attorney General
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
points out in in in that letter uh the
 
04:45:00.190 --> 04:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
average person wouldn't understand that
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
and that's where the violation of the
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
due process clause comes into place and
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
then just two other things just to
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the uh things that
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
were said earlier I would say that uh
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that this has no no
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
this has an impact on independent
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures in in fact this has no
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
impact on independent expenditures uh
 
04:45:20.830 --> 04:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
groups doing independent expenditures OB
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
already have to already have to uh file
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
receipts and expenditures if you want to
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
see an example that just check Americans
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity in the in the in the
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system you will see
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
numerous independent expenditures
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
included in in there so those are
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
already covered and then and then uh the
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
last point is is that is that this
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
legislation uh was was told that was
 
04:45:48.030 --> 04:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to find a way to become make more
 
04:45:50.350 --> 04:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
transparent election and Communications
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
and as I said given the fact that there
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
are other things that take place within
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
state government over the Arc of over
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
the Arc of the 60 days before a primary
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
and 60 days before a general that is an
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that is is too broad and I
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
would encourage of the committee for all
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
those reasons all these reasons to find
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill an expedient to legislate and
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions questions from committee
 
04:46:19.830 --> 04:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
online Mr Moore I I have a question in
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
the past in this
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
discussion we have heard the issue of
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
Publications being made by Town
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
officials in regards to elections or say
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters who reports to
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
put out
 
04:46:45.310 --> 04:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
informational um information certainly
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
usually within 60 days of an election um
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
do you think that the definition that's
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
being used here
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
66423 would Encompass those I don't
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
think I've heard anybody talk about
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
those kind of things uh certainly the
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
the the the way this this uh bill is
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
drafted it is is uh intentionally
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
designed to catch a very very wide net U
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
which which is what leads to the
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional defect of not being well
 
04:47:16.990 --> 04:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
tailored and and fundamentally uh a
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
voter guide or something like that if
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
you spent $2,500 to mail out a voter
 
04:47:23.470 --> 04:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
guide across across the state or across
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
the district or in districts various
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
districts across the state and that
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
included so much as one instance of the
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
use of the name of a candidate then that
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
organization would then therefore
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
automatically have to file as a
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
political advocacy
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
organization thank you for the
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any thank you
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%

see that come in but I have not had a
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
chance to read it so thank you um signed
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
up to talk this afternoon was Mr Hannon
 
04:48:12.030 --> 04:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
he was not there but he is here now and
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
us uh hello thank you for for listening
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
to me today my name is Joe Hannah I'm
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
the vice president for gun owners of New
 
04:48:24.670 --> 04:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh having some technical
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
difficulties here I've been dropped a
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
few times so um I did hear uh the
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
previous uh uh person's testimony and
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
that does save a lot of time for us cuz
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
he repeated pretty much almost
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
everything I wanted to say uh I do think
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's um it's very difficult to have
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
blackout periods for uh educating the
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
public on issues that are important to
 
04:48:47.230 --> 04:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
different organizations that may or may
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
not be political advocacy organizations
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
just because it's a primary season uh or
 
04:48:54.990 --> 04:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
general election season uh like uh the
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimon testifier said you
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
know there are issues that come up
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
within those periods that have nothing
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
to do with those general elections and
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
um the the bar is is lowering the bar is
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
only hurting some of these smaller
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and organizations that are
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily political advoc advocacy
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
groups that would fall into that
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
category so I I strongly urge you to to
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
itl HB 468 thank
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%

04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hannon from anybody in committee members
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
electronically I'm not seeing any thank
 
04:49:32.470 --> 04:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr Hannon for joining us is there
 
04:49:34.350 --> 04:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else in attendance at the
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
meeting this afternoon who would like to
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
speak I see Senator Rubin has added his
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
hands to come back and with the ease of
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
the electronics welcome
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you for having me back and uh
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
forgive me for neglecting to add this
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
little bit to the
 
04:49:57.150 --> 04:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and a little tiny bit of
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
rebuttal here uh this bill is not a
 
04:50:01.470 --> 04:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
blackout it doesn't doesn't prevent
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
anyone from communicating if you're
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to spend more than $2,500 in that
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
60-day window it just increases
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
transparency voters can know what's
 
04:50:09.360 --> 04:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
transparency voters can know what's
going

04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
on uh but what I wanted to add because I
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
categorized this bill as closing uh some
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the dark money loophole and this is
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
National Data we I don't have good data
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire but in the 2020
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
elections um this this dark money
 
04:50:30.670 --> 04:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
question has become very partisan with
 
04:50:33.070 --> 04:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
conservatives opposing increased
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
transparency and and people on the left
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
and Democrats supporting it and that may
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
be historical artifact of the fact that
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans used to be better at getting
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
harnessing and using this money in 2020
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
dark money nationally uh Republicans
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
were outspent two to one by democrats in
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
the could you define dark money for us
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
as you proceed please money that is
 
04:51:02.110 --> 04:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
spent to influence the outcome of
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
Elections or policy matter Ms or
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
resolutions isn't that any political
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
spending money that is uh spent but the
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
source of the money is not disclosed so
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
you see the money happening the voters
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
can see there there is money being spent
 
04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
to influence your thinking about a
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
particular candidate or
 
04:51:22.590 --> 04:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
measure uh but you don't know where the
 
04:51:24.430 --> 04:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
money is coming from that's that's dark
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
money in general so I just I want to
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
point out because this issue this matter
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
has become Wicked partisan that the the
 
04:51:35.190 --> 04:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans have got gotten really badly
 
04:51:37.948 --> 04:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
behind the curve since 2018 it began in
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
2018 Republicans used to be ahead we're
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
behind now in the Biden uh Trump
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
election that just happened in November
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
dark money for Biden six to one greater
 
04:51:51.868 --> 04:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
than dark money for Trump so so in
 
04:51:54.110 --> 04:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
general Democrats and the left have
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot better at this technique
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
than people on the right so I don't want
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
the issue to be pardon partisan but but
 
04:52:05.788 --> 04:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
in the past I have a theory that people
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
on the right have supported restricted
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
transparency as a result of Republicans
 
04:52:14.548 --> 04:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
potentially being better at harnessing
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
harvesting and using dark money that's
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
no longer the case this this matter
 
04:52:21.230 --> 04:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
should not be partisan at all I'll I'll
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
conclude there thank you Mr
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
hin thank you for humoring my questions
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
during your testimony does anybody have
 
04:52:32.430 --> 04:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Senator Rubin
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing anybody thanks for

04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%

24th and 25th I can't remember exactly
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%

04:53:58.350 --> 04:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
committee would have the first week in
 
04:53:58.360 --> 04:53:59.628 align:start position:0%
committee would have the first week in
March

04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
March
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
off um but maybe I'll have some
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
discussions with representative Cody
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
about the schedule because we still have
 
04:54:12.510 --> 04:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
quite a few bills to exec and if I look
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
at them organizationally we have a full
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
day if not more I think of testimony on
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
bills related to absentee
 
04:54:24.510 --> 04:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
ballots um and then another full day of
 
04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
testimony on bills related
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
to uh forms and registration and same
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
day voting
 
04:54:36.990 --> 04:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
so I we need to try and get all of that
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
worked in for testimony and voting in
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
time for crossover so um more I should
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
be able to have a better idea of letting
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know more of what I'm hoping to
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
schedule to be in March next week so put
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
