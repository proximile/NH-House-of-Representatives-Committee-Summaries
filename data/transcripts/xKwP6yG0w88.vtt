00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
good morning um the time being 10:03 on
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
the 24th um I would like to um bring
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee to order um
 
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh I've been around here for a number of
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
years and the task that we that this
 
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is facing
 
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
is incredibly difficult and I'm not
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
really sure there is a workable answer
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
these bills don't belong here they
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
belong a few hundred miles south of here
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
and Washington because this is a problem
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
that is a national problem affecting
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
every state it is not only affecting New
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and only because the US
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Congress has not been willing to step up
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
to the plate um we in this state are
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
doing what has happened in a number of
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
other states and we're trying to do the
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
best that we
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
can um a number of us have worked on
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
this listening to people in the public
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
listening to information that we we
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
received and I can tell you uh
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
definitely that the people who worked on
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that you now see before
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
you no one is completely happy and
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
therefore I think think we might have
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
done a pretty decent
 
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.070 align:start position:0%
done a pretty decent
job

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
um what we tried to do is pay attention
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
to what was happening in other
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
states be as close as we possibly could
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
to that to make it a little easier when
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
the time comes for the US Congress to
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
decide what to do but we had to honor
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
some differences which makes sense in a
 
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.309 align:start position:0%
some differences which makes sense in a
small

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
state um you have before for you that i'
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
I've distributed here in the room uh
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
draft amendments dated the 2 uh the the
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
22nd of the month and I must say that I
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
violated one of my basic rules I wrote
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
that it was a draft I put the date but I
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
did not put any names on there um and um
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry about that but this is
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
these are proposed amendments that the
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
chairman of the full
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh chairman Lynn and the chair
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee me um uh would like to
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
jointly introduce to the full committee
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
if in fact the subcommittee agrees um I
 
00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
also want to add because all of this is
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
a moving Target there is there are some
 
00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:24.790 align:start position:0%
a moving Target there is there are some
additional

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
changes um that um chairman Lynn is
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to bring to our attention um that
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
aren't in these amendments uh but at
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
least you can begin with some written
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
copy that might keep everybody on the
 
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
copy that might keep everybody on the
same

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.710 align:start position:0%
same
page

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
um and I am indebted to all of you who
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
have let us know what you consider
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
important or what changes you would make
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
and also to um uh representative f one
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the uh co-sponsors of the bill and to
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
um former uh representative Kirk for um
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
using a lot of their time to help us get
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
as close to yes as we could get so with
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
that I would like to um present to you
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the these two amendments that are
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
headed um draft
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the date of
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
10:22 and they they're both separate and
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
nonetheless relate to each other and
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
which is why each of the bills was sent
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
here um so with that
 
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.030 align:start position:0%
here um so with that
introduction

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
um I think um I think the next thing I
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
would do um um to share the wealth here
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
is to ask um chairman Lynn if he would
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
begin with the house bill House Bill
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
314 um and then do that first and then
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
we can go on to um uh the Senate bill
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
and uh repres uh chairman Lynn if you
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
would perhaps you could highlight some
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the key um differences
 
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
of the key um differences
yes

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
AB thank you so
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess the the um the first thing
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would say and I and I'll go over um
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
the um house bill um 314 the proposed
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes first the the thing I would say
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
at the outset though is one of the
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
things that we were concerned about
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
because these two these two bills do
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
have some some overlap as I think
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware and we wanted to make
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we we were we weren't
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
having anybody subject to both bills we
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
weren't in other words somebody that's
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
going to be regulated we didn't want to
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
have them kind of subject to both bills
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
so the only thing I would say I'll I'll
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
talk about 255 later but the one thing
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
that I would say is the the The Entity
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to talk about now that
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
will be covered by um uh 314 House Bill
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
314 are by language that's been added to
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
255 which I'll talk about later are
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
specifically excluded from
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
255 so um that's uh and and it's a
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial a pretty significant
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
exclusion which I'll talk about um but
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
anyway so let me let me turn to 314
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
as you may
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
recall by way of
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
background the original
 
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.310 align:start position:0%
background the original
bill

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
um purported to
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
establish um a an expectation of
 
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
establish um a an expectation of
privacy

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
um that appli to that applied to certain
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
information and then it all and it and
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
then dealt went on to say that the that
 
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
then dealt went on to say that the that
governmental

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
governmental
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
entities um can only obtain private
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
information from what are referred to as
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
third-party providers in certain ways
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then there was a um there was a
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
provision that
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
um purported to that
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh at least arguably would have allowed
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
causes of private causes of action
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
against both the government and private
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
private entities and that was the
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
subject of some of some uh some concern
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
I I I had proposed an amendment that
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
change that but what we came up with in
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
three in the in the amendment to
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
314 that you have before you is a
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
that basically applies only to the
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
covered entities and let me talk about
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
initially what the covered entities are
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
because this I think this is
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
particularly important um you'll see in
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
par in um what has been designated as
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
proposed RSA
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
57i um uh in in Roman numeral 2 it
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
describes what the covered entities are
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it just and it refers to them as
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
third-party providers of information and
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
services and it basically goes on to say
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
that it means the
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
following the uh the follow people who
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
provide or individuals who provide the
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
following kinds of services um cellular

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
pretty good pretty good list of of uh of
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
of entities um but it's it's nowhere
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
near as large as the entities that were
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
that uh would be covered by
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
255 um then uh in uh section i1 Roman
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 um there is a definition of
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
what available to the public means uh
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
because information as you'll as I go
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
through this you'll see information that
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
is made available to the public uh that
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
that is available to the public is
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
basically excluded from this in other
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
words it's if the if information is
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
available to the public in accordance
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
with that with the definition here then
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's not considered to be personal
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
information um so subsection then we go
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
on to subsection I2 of the bill that is
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
really the heart of the bill and
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
essentially it says uh I'll just read it
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
an individual shall have a reasonable
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in personal
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
information as that's defined um in the
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
in the definition section including
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
content and usage given to or um or held
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
by a third-party provider of information
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
and services and not available to the
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
public third part party providers of
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
information and services shall not
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
disclose personal information of an
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
individual to anyone
 
00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:07.670 align:start position:0%
individual to anyone
unless

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um one of two one of three conditions
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
exist first such individual has given
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
explicit consent for the disclosure to
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
one or more of of the information to one
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
or more others secondly an emergency
 
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
exists where there is a danger uh an
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
imminent danger of of death or serious
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
bodily in a serious physical injury to
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
or substantial loss or destruction of
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
privacy of property if the information
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
is not disclosed or third the
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
information is disclosed in accordance
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
with the provisions of uh sections I3
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
which I'll get to in a moment in
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
section I uh I2 Roman numeral 2 we've
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
set out what specific requirements of
 
00:16:58.829 --> 00:16:58.839 align:start position:0%
what needs to be met uh for consent um
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
and it provides that um as you'll see
 
00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
that it is an
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
optin requirement of consent now that's
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
different notice that that's different
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
from what is in 255 which again we'll
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
talk about after but this is an
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
optin consent provision and it requires
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
that if a if a provider of information
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
is going to request consent from an
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
individual um the um the request for
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
consent has to be sent has to be
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
communicated in a simple clear and
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
unambiguous form and must State the
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
purpose for which the consent is sought
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
the consent communication has to be
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
separate this is a big I think a a big
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
point the consent communication has to
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
be separate from any other communication
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
that the provider sends so it can't be
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
we're 35 pages of gobble deuk and one of
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
them says uh you know I cons uh by by
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
responding to this I consent it can't be
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
that and then the last the last thing
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
and this is I think probably the heart
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
of it the communication must be
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
structured so that the individual is
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
required to respond by performing an
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
affirmative act to opt in to consent so
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
um uh so then I
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
um in there's I want to make sure that
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
right last minute change is on is on
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
that okay it's on this file okay all
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
right so I'm gonna talk about I'm G talk
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
about this and then okay all right yeah
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's a good point so uh this is
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
255 this is this
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
is so um
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
is so um
then

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
all right so so then in I3 let me turn
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
then to to section I3 which provides
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is the
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
one this amendment is different from
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
earlier versions of the bill in that
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
I3 it now
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
describes when a provide a covered
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
provider can give information to when
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
the request for the information comes
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
from from a government entity but bear
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
in mind this is different than the
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
earlier versions which were aimed at the
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
government entity the in other words the
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
the the the way the earlier version was
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
drafted is it said the government entity
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
can only get information in certain
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances this has changed so it
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to the government entity
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
it applies to the private provider but
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
what it say says is if you're a private
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
provider that's covered by the Act and
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
the person that's requesting information
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
from you is a government entity you can
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
only give it to the government entity if
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
if the if it meets the requirements of
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
section three so um the first one is uh
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
when when requested to do so by a
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
government uh investigative regulatory
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
furnishes to the provider uh the uh
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
provides the gives the provider uh the
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
basis of of of the governmental entity's
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
Authority uh to make such a demand or
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
second a court has issued an order that
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
such notice not be given so in other
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
words the default position is if the if
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
you're a provider and the government
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
says give me certain information and
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that that it's within one of of
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the five Provisions that allows the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
government to get the information the
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
provider the provider can comply the
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
provider must comply um but the com the
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
provider has to give notice to the
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
individual that it pertains in other
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
words you know Mr Smith uh you should
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
know that the uh the the government has
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
asked for certain information to be
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
turned over to you um to uh to them uh
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
relating to you and so we've done that
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
um that has to be done contemporaneously
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
unless one of the situations um is uh
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
that that is described in that section
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh would would prohibit it so for
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
example if it were a grand jury request
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
the the the the the prosecutor
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
presumably would say or may say don't
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
disclose this information because it's
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
covered by Grand Jury secrecy if if that
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
applied and grand jury secrecy not
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily apply in all
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance ances but it might very
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
well apply um importantly subsection I4
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
of this uh provides that no third-party
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
provider of or of information and
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
services may require a waiver from the
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter as a
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
condition for any individual to do
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
business with it so there it's got to be
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's got to be a real waiver uh
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
not not that if you w if unless you wave
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
this when not doing business with you
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
and then section five is the remedies uh
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
section and one of the big things as as
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
many of you may know one of the big
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
things for me was uh my concern with
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
with both 255 and 314 was the prospect
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
of a private right of action um you'll
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
see in I5 that we have eliminated the
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
private right of action the Attorney
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
General is allowed to enforce
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
um uh the statute and to invoke the
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
provisions of the consumer protection
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
act which provide for uh in the um in
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
um in the case of actions brought by the
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the the the Attorney
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
General may may seek um civil penalties
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
or actual uh or up to $1,000 in actual
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry actual damages or penalties
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
up to ,000
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
um for for each violation of the chapter
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's um
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
314 and I should say
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
I've yeah Le I'm was going to talk about
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
the changes that
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
I've the ones that are in here yeah so
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know what the one the the proposed
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
distributed I'm sorry sure just stop for
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
um uh as I said at the beginning
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's completely happy which is why I
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
think these might be good um uh the
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
private right of action has always been
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
something that I thought made a lot of
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
sense because um we are talking about
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
the individuals who choose to live in
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
this state and should have the rights
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to them under the state
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
constitution however um in trying
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
to to do the best that we possibly could
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
do in a world with disperate
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
views we let that go
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
um in what we're proposing to the
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee now in addition um because
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
um chairman Lynn
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
um uh has in fact now is approaching his
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh one fourth
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
year end of his second term in the
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
legisl lure he still by and large keeps
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
close to his heart and his brain his
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that were developed
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
when he served in another branch of
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
government and because of that he read
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
this and then said okay but if we're
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the consumer protection
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
act where do we say that and the
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
question is was a legitimate question so
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
after these drafts were
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
prepared um then chairman Lynn wants to
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
present to us some additional
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
changes and so those don't appear in the
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
draft that you have seen they do appear
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
in another draft that there might not be
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
any need
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
to to distribute to you but which um the
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
Chairman's going to explain now is that
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's the right background so
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
that the the the subsequent draft that
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
that uh uh representative Smith just
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
referred to what what it changes from
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
the one I just went
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
is I just want to make sure I'm right on
 
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.470 align:start position:0%
is I just want to make sure I'm right on
this

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh ABCD yeah ABCD yes so what it changes
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
is if you go to the one the one I just
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
went over that I just went over and you
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
go to section um 507
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
I um
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
3 Roman numeral 2 so that's where the
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
the changes start on the one I'm about
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about now so what I was think
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
when when I finished the drafting of the
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
one we just talked about I I really sort
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
of said well wait a minute you know
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't we that that as I just explained
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
said you have to provide the inform the
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
the the provider who is who gets a
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
request from the government to provide
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
information has to give contemporaneous
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
notice and as I was thinking about that
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
about 4 o'clock in the morning one
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
morning over the weekend as I was
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
obsessing about these uh amendments um
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that I was that um what
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
I forgotten is well what I what I
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
thought about was well wait a minute why
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
should it be only
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously particularly if you're
 
00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:37.389 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously particularly if you're
talking

00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
about a request in the form either of of
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
a of a request from a government entity
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
or of a subpoena from a government
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
entity why shouldn't the um why
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the government entity be
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
required not to demand production of the
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
information for a reasonable time so
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
that if the if the individual who is the
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
subject of that request has thinks that
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
he or she has a basis to object the
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
individual has time to go to court to
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
make the objection so in in subsection
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
in the new amendment that I'm going to
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
talk about now in subsection I3 Roman
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 it says and I'm when a
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
government entity seeks the disclosure
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
of information from a provider of
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
information and services pursuant
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
to uh sections 3 one A or B and that's
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
one a is the request and 1B is when it's
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
made by a subpoena the request or demand
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
for such information shall not require
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
production of the information sooner
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
than 10 days from the date the request
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
or demand is made
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
within so that's that is that that is a
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
change in that it's a that is now a
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
restriction on the government it says to
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
a government agency or even a grand jury
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever it says to whoever from the
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
government is asking for information if
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
you issue a subpoena for example you
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
can't demand production in less than 10
 
00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:24.039 align:start position:0%
days um and it goes on to say within
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
five days of receiving such request or
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
demand the provider shall notify the
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
individual to whom the information
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
pertains that the request or demand has
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
been made so that such individual has an
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pursue judicial remedies
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
to prevent compliance with the request
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
or demand if there are valid grounds to
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
do so however there's then a provisor
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
provided however that no such notice
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
shall be given if in the first instance
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
the government entity seeking the
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
information demands that such notice not
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
be provided and furnishes the provider
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
with the the basis of its authority to
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
make such demand or two a court has
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
issued an order that such notice not be
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
given so that if they you know if the if
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh if there are legitimate reasons
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
for example the grand jury subpoena that
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
might be that might be one uh under
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances for the government
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
to say no we want
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
no no Bank of America we're issuing you
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
this subpoena but we we don't want you
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
to disclose to Bob Linn the the person
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
who whose records they're asking for
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
that that that the grand jury has made
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
that request they can say we have the
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and and the bank is
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
required not to give me notice or if a
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
court has issued an order saying don't
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
give any notice so then Ro Roman numeral
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
3 of that section deals with the other
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
three the other three circumstances in
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
which the government May request U
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
information and that's in the case of a
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
search warrant or an emergency and so
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
what it what it says in those
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances if it's a search warrant
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
or if it's if it's one of the emergency
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
situations then in that circumstance the
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
the provider has to give contemporaneous
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
notice not advanced notice but
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous notice that the that the
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
search War has been executed or that
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
such an or that they're giving over the
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
information pursuant to an
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
emergency and again that section has the
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
Proviso that if the that if the if the
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
government entity has the authority to
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
to demand that um the search warrant not
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
be disclosed or if a court has issued an
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
order um demand uh requiring that the
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
search W not be disclosed or that the
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
emergency not be disclosed it's kind of
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
probably would be difficult to imagine
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency but maybe that could happen
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
um anyway and in those circumstances
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
then no disclosure um is made um so I
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
think I I guess what I'm saying is I
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
think the the latest amendment is is
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
just a little more complete it it sort
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
of it it sort of
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
um deals with what happens um when when
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
one of these requests by the government
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
is made
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
what does the pro what what uh what are
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
the constraints on the the government in
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
making the request and what does the
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
provider who gets the request have to do
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
Visa the individual that's the subject
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
request now you can take a deep
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
breath could I have that yes of course
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee um what I'm
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
slight

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
slight
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment as
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
um further explained by chairman Lynn I
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
am Crossing
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
off in this very official way um the
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
cover page because the cover page makes
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
it seem as if this is the bill that had
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
been presented to us with all the
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
numbers on it and I don't want people to
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
be confused but if you
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
could so and this will now can now go to
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
the the first page is just crossed off
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
with all the numbers and codes and
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
whatever but um the rest is here and
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
somebody could just
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
come okay let me know if that's not
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
enough yeah okay um thank you
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk um so this amendment
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
then includes all of the
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
changes um that were in the first one we
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
presented to you plus the addition one
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
consumers and now I would like to ask um
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
members um if they
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
have any comments or
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
questions or if they would like to hear
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
Andrew there we go thank you madam chair
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
yeah my only thing on these amendments
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
is I believe no matter what our opinion
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
is here and now they should be both
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
taken to the full
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee because it just should be
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
voted on by everyone oh um of course the
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
the process as always is that the
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would make a recommendation
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
to the full committee on November and if
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
we can do that today then we as a
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will not be meeting again
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
if we can't do that we would meet again
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee we have to prepare a
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee um
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
on November 8th the chair uh chairman
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
Lynn has called for the full committee
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
to come together for a work session and
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
where it is appropriate for an executive
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
session to vote on all of the retained
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
bills um and if we can get through that
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
process on the 8th so be it if for
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
example the full committee suggests
 
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
other amendments or other changes that
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
would have to be considered those would
 
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.190 align:start position:0%
would have to be considered those would
be

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
um prepared and then we would come
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
together again on the 15th to um to take
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
our final votes um on all the bills that
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
had been retained by this committee
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
those bills would then go to the Full
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
House and uh they would be voted on on
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
the 3 on or the fourth or if it goes on
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
forever and ever on the 11th um
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so you're absolutely right and
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately New Hampshire being I
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
believe the only state in the United
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
States that does this um no bill ends up
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
without having been voted on by the full
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
house so are you okay with that
 
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.550 align:start position:0%
house so are you okay with that
representative

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Andress okay
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
meanwhile this doesn't have to be cast
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
in stone yet um
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
and the the Suns in my eyes but I can
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
imagine I know who would like to ask a
 
00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.910 align:start position:0%
imagine I know who would like to ask a
question

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
representor am I getting a reputation
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
um just a specific thanks for sharing
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
this language because I was I was trying
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
to put the pieces together of what you
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
were saying which sounded sounded very
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable so am I reading that this is
 
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.069 align:start position:0%
reasonable so am I reading that this is
there's

00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
a 10day waiting period before you give
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
it out but five days after the demand is
 
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.829 align:start position:0%
it out but five days after the demand is
made

00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
before within that period you have to
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
give the notice to the per to the person
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
who's the recipient so so is it the
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
intent that there be 10 days for that
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
person to to object or because it seems
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
like in this instance maybe they only
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
get the five days no that's right my
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
intent was to give only five days
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
because I think that this this is my my
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
intent was this is some particularly if
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's you know if it's a if it's a
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
request for a government agency I can
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
just from my own prior experience um
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
there can often be the government's in a
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
hurry and and and often for good reason
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the government's in a hurry and so um I
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I thought that 10 days to
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
comply in other words 10 days to demand
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
compliance was a
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
was probably you shouldn't go beyond
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
that and therefore in order to give the
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
person at least five days to object um
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I that's why it's
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
worded the way it is so that the the
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
let's say you're the let's say this is a
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena to a bank so the you know the
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
bank gets a subpoena it says provide
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
direct provide the information on Lynn's
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
bank records uh and it has to say if you
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
know if if today is the 24th it can't do
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
it for 10 days but now I'm the bank I've
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
got to give within five days I've got to
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
give notice to Lynn that by you know by
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
the way we've got a subpoena to saying
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
to turn over your records and we're
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
going to do it on on day 10 um unless
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
somebody tells us not basically unless
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
somebody tells us not to and then what I
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
can do is you know I can go get my
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer and say wait a minute they
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena me they there's no basis for
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
this I want you to move to quash The
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
subpoena and and the my lawyer
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
presumably or me would have 5 days to do
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah thanks that's how I read it I
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
just wasn't sure if that was how what I
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
was correct in whether that was the
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
intent so that thank you no that is the
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
intent yes any other questions from us
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
um would the members of the
 
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.069 align:start position:0%
um would the members of the
subcommittee

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
um be interested in hearing any
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
reactions from others in the room or
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
would you prefer at this point
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
to focus within the subcommittee on our
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
discussions let me reward that does
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
anyone have any objection if there is
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
someone in the room who would like to
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
add a comment or ask a
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
question all right is there anyone in
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
the room who would like to add a comment
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
or ask a
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
question and I begin by reminding you
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
that um we do not not live in a perfect
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
world and no one is claiming that this
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
is perfect um uh and so I want you to to
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind um uh go ahead I know
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
I should remember your name but I've
 
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.230 align:start position:0%
just forgotten it I'm
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
just forgotten it I'm
[Music]

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm Matt Schwarz from Consumer
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
Reports thank you so I mean I'll caveat
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
all of this that I just saw these
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendments this morning so so I might be
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
misconstruing things but I have some
 
00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:31.950 align:start position:0%
misconstruing things but I have some
initial

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.470 align:start position:0%
initial
thoughts

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
um you know on
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
255 I think that since the last time
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
we've met the exemptions kind of make it
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
wait a minute we're only we've only done
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
we've only presented HB 314 right now so
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
we haven't done anything with 255 we'll
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
get to that once we finish um 314 sure
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
because they are two separate bills
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
although related to each other and for
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
those of you who might have been late
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
and not heard the interest the
 
00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
introduction if you are covered in one
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills you are not covered in
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
the other in order to make clear the you
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
know the differences in in how we were
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
pursuing this so now that you know we're
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
focusing first on the house bill do you
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
have any comments on the house bill and
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
if so great and if not you can come back
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
when we get to the Senate bill yeah okay
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
it might be better to talk about them
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
together when we discussed them both
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
because yeah they're very intermingled
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
and and how they they deal with things
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll let you talk about 255 I
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
have thoughts on 314 but they make more
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
sense in in light of what happened with
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
255 okay so you don't want so you'll do
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
that when we get to the Senate bill yeah
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
now yeah have you had a chance to look
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't want to shut
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
off any debate um you
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to do the best that we
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
can so if anybody has anything please
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
let us know all right I don't see anyone
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
else what about anyone else on the
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee do you have any
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions um about um what the we've
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
attempted to do here with these two
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
bills and in order
 
00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:45.349 align:start position:0%
bills and in order
to

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
um try to
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
um actually play the role of Solomon
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
without a baby being present um and uh
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
thank goodness
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh but trying to again reinforce that
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
this doesn't belong here at all it
 
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
belongs it belongs in Congress but we
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
are going to fulfill Our obligation to
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state by doing this
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
anything else no I I guess you know I
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
just want to I would make a comment I
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
really want to um I mean I I given where
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
we started out on these bills
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the really wide disparity of
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
views um I I I just want to express my
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
thanks to the to uh the chair and to
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
representative uh Kirk former
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk and representative
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
Earth um I really think that we you know
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
this was a this was a significant
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
compromise all around people coming
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
together and I
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
think you know at the LA at the risk of
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
s ort of my tooting the Horn of the four
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
of us I think we did a pretty fair job
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
of of compromising and coming to a point
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
where at least the four of us can agree
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
now you know the the the rest of of this
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you may have different
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
views and maybe the whole committee will
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
think we're all wet but I hope they
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
don't um and so I um you know I feel
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
like I'm I'm I'm happy at the progress
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
we've made and I thank you madam chair
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I thank you um I I because they are
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
separate bills unless you have an
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
objection at this point I would like to
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for um its
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation to the full committee
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the house bill
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
314 um are you do you feel at this point
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
ready to make a recommendation to the
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
full committee that will review do this
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
on the 8th of
 
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.470 align:start position:0%
on the 8th of
November

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
um so if one of you would like
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
to uh make a motion I would be so
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
inclined to accept
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
that so is it appropriate for me to make
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
the motion or should somebody else well
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
I think representative tur might be
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
willing to yeah I'd like I'd like to
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
make the moot motion to um accept I
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
guess the amendment um as as distributed
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the revised Amendment as distributed
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
Rec in the last draft okay and is there
 
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
Rec in the last draft okay and is there
a

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
second okay so moved by tur and seconded
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
by Andress um and
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
discussion if not not um I think we
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
could probably just do this by a show of
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
hands rather than a roll call so if you
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
are in favor of the motion to
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
present the
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
version with the scratch door first page
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
hand okay so that is unanimous so 314
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
will go
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
on to the um to the full committee and
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
what will be before us that day is a
 
00:49:29.799 --> 00:49:31.109 align:start position:0%
what will be before us that day is a
newly

00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
newly
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
drafted version of this um with the
 
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.430 align:start position:0%
drafted version of this um with the
proper

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
proper
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
headlines okay now let's go let's
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
go from here to the Senate
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to open up discussion
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
um on Senate Bill
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
255 um
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledging I think very very
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
significantly the differences between
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
the two bills and who they apply to
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that we hope in each case
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
we are honoring the rights to privacy of
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state in the way
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
not the most
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
ideal so let's see representative Lynn
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
why would you like
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
to this is a
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
different kettle of fish or balll of wax
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
or something would you like to present
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate the changes that we're
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
proposing in the Senate Bill yes thank
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um so um let me uh go
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
through it
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
um sort of line by line if you will with
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
that the changes are reflected in
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
bold um so I think the
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
first the first change that you will uh
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
see is in
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
section five I want make sure I'm right
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
on that that I haven't missed something
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
um yes in in section 507
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
H2 um you'll see that um we've changed
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
the threshold applicability that would
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
be on page four line 23 of the draft
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have before well it's
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
actually line 24 of the draft amendment
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
that you have before
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
you and and so it says
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
um that um during uh that this that this
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
bill is applicable to uh to persons that
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
conduct business in this state or
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
persons that produce products or
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
services that are targeted to residents
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
of this state that during a one-year
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
period um a controlled or processed the
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
personal data of not less than 35,000
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's reduced from 100,000 to
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
35,000 unique consumers and and we've
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
added the word unique because what we
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
want to that that is designed to
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
prevent it's designed to make it clear
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
that if if you know if if I'm if I'm the
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
consumer of some business and I and I'm
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
the one that makes that deals with the
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
business 35,000 times in a year that
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the business qualifies
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's got to be 35,000 different
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
individuals um that that in order to in
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
order to qualify um and so that so it's
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
reduced from 100,000 to 30 to 35,000 and
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
then as the second trigger uh it would
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
be or or controlled or processed the
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
personal data of not less than
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
10,000 unique consumers uh and derive
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
not more than 25% of gross revenue from
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
the sale of personal debt um so that
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's a that's uh a significant change
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um then you will see the next um the
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
next change and this is this is the
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
change that accomplishes what I talked
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
about four that is removing from this
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
bill the entities that are covered by
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
314 so it adds um an exclusion in RSA
 
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.069 align:start position:0%
314 so it adds um an exclusion in RSA
507

00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
507
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
H3 one it adds a new section Roman
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
numeral 1
 
00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
G um and that's on page five line four
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the draft that you have in front of
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
you and that's for indiv and you'll see
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
definition uh is virtually the same
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
almost word for word as in uh three um
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
as uh as a definition in 314 individuals
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
organizations or legal entities which
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
collect personal information about an
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
individual in connection with providing
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
the following kinds of uh Services
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
cellular and landline telephone electric
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
water or other utilities internet
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
service providers cable television
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
streaming services social media Services
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
email service providers Banks and
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
financial institutions insurance
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
companies and credit card companies um
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
so those people are
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
excluded from
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
255 because they are covered by
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
um page six line 21 right then this is
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh in you'll see that in this
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
section uh uh H3 Roman numeral 2 there
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
are listed a bunch of of uh of uh
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
organizations that are that are not
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
covered uh or types of information that
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
are not covered and what we've done is
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
in response to a request by uh
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
um someone repres who
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
represents um someone that provides that
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that sells uh chemicals that could
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
be precursors for control substances
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
they asked that we add an exemption
 
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:44.839 align:start position:0%
because they are required by federal law
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
to provide certain information so that Q
 
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
the new proposed subsection Q of that
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
says personal information maintained or
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
used for purposes of compliance I with
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
the regulation of listed chemicals under
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
the federal control Substances Act so
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's I mean that it seems like that
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
made that made perfect sense to add that
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the next change is in subsection uh
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
H4 and it's in Roman numeral 2
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
um you may
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
um you may recall that in the original
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
Bill there is a
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
um requirement that the um controller of
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
information have establish a um a
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
procedure for
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
um uh exemptions uh for a procedure for
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
for uh somebody to say I don't want my
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
personal information given out um under
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
the original bill that was decide that
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
was established by the controller
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the information we've changed this to
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
say it's the secretary of state that
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
will describe this procedure and as
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see in other sections that I'm
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to get to the idea of
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is so that the secretary of state
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
will will establish one
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
procedure for people to be able to opt
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
out this is in this in this bill it is
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
an opt out rather than an opin provision
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
but this says the secretary of state
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
will establish one procedure that all
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
covered companies are to comply with so
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
we don't we change that what would would
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
have been allowed under the original 255
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
that basically said look company a can
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
have this procedure for opt out Company
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
B can have this company C can have this
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
we basically said the secretary of state
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
will establish a procedure that all
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
companies that are subject to this must
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
comply with and that seemed to me again
 
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of the areas of
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
compromise I you know the perfect world
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
I might have said n maybe something else
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
but I I I can I understand the argument
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side and I think this makes
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh perfect sense in in that Spirit um if
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
if I could interrupt at this point for
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
just a moment you will see as you
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
continue to read this section that the
 
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.710 align:start position:0%
continue to read this section that the
word

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.230 align:start position:0%
word
controller

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
controller
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
appears and and it should you do not
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
think that that should be taken out um
 
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
think that that should be taken out um
and

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
substituted uh with Secretary of State
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
it is the controller who's going to have
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
to apply
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
this but the standard will have been
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
established by the Secretary of State
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
very very good point that's exactly
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
right um and you'll see then that that
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
that the reference to the Secretary of
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
State also appears
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
in uh RSA 507 H Roman numeral 6 I'm
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
sorry H colon 6 at in Roman numeral
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
3 uh which reads A a controller shall
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
provide consumers with a reasonably
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
accessible clear and meaningful privacy
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
notice meeting standards established by
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
State and then goes on to goes on for
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
further requirements and then in
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
subsection that same uh subsection Roman
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
numeral 5A says a controller sh shall
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
establish and shall describe in a
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
privacy notice consistent with the
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Secretary of State
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
one or more secure and reliable means
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
for consumers to submit a request to
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
exercise their U consumer rights
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:05.950 align:start position:0%
um all right
uh

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
next haven't missed anything um page
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
16 20 yeah okay so right so I
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the so this um now we get to the
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement section and you may recall
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill there was a
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
requirement um that the
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh that the Attorney General give uh
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
someone who was was ENT a covered entity
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
that was alleged to have violated the
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill the Attorney General was required
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
to give that entity the option to cure
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
which was a subject of some some debate
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh in the committee so what this what
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
this does is to change that and actually
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
there I had proposed an earlier
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that was we we had discussed
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
but never had it hadn't come up for a
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
vote but it basically says that during
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
year after this bill becomes takes
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
effect as law during that first year yes
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
the the Attorney General must give the
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
U The Entity that is alleged to have
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
violated the uh statute an opportunity
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
to to cure but after that first year
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the Attorney General does
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
not have to give it but has the option
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
to give it so that's uh that's
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of consistent with that
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
earlier amendment that I had talked
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
about and it in subsection three of of
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
h11 it then it it the the the original
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh version is change so that it says in
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that is after January
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
1st of 2026
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
after the Bill's in been in effect for a
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
year it then describes when the Attorney
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
General is going to exercise has the
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
discretion to to allow cure it describes
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
the factors that the Attorney General
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
should consider in deciding weather to
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
allow an opportunity for cure um and
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
then the last change and this is in
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
subsection Roman numeral four of Section
 
01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
subsection Roman numeral four of Section
8

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
8
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
h11 um it it says uh nothing in this
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be construed as providing
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
the basis for or be subject to a private
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
right of action for violations under
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
this chapter and the words or any other
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
law has been added which is which is
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
what a um a number of the other states I
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
believe Connecticut and the other states
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
also have added this and the purpose of
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
that is just to ensure that somebody's
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we don't you know clever lawyers
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't say well yes we can't there's no
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
private right of action under this but
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh we're bringing our action under the
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know the consumer protection act or
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're bringing our action under
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
something else um and therefore it's
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
okay this is designed to capture that
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's no basically make it clear
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's no private right of action
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
period full stop um so that's
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
um that's that's really it um and as I I
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
say I think the L the most significant
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
change is the change that cuts out from
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill the entities that are covered
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
by 314 that's and I you know I think
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
we'd have to concede that that's a
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
pretty significant a number of people of
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
entities that cut out um but um it's the
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
kind of entities that it seems to me
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's a particular interest in
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
preserving in
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
protecting the privacy of information
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
that those entities hold about
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
individuals um and and
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
therefore um they should be subject to
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
the more onerous requirements of
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
314 um and you know in in particular the
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
requirement of an optin for that kind of
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
information as opposed to an opt out so
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
with that I'll shut
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
up thank you so that you can see this is
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
the much longer bill but um the changes
 
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
the much longer bill but um the changes
are

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably a little
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
more easy to understand um anybody on
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
the committee have any questions
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
point is there anyone in the audience
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
who would like to make constructive
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
comments to help
 
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
us find our
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
way yes Mr Schwarz this time I
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:59.670 align:start position:0%
way yes Mr Schwarz this time I
remember

01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to speak
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
match words from consumer reports for
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
the record and thank you for your
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
continued work on this legislation and
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that a lot of these
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
discussions are being held in public
 
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity to comment and that
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't go unnotice and it's
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
appreciated so again I'll start with the
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
caveat that I've just seen the
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we're talking about this
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
morning and so I could be totally
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting things
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
but I think the simplest way to sum up
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
my thoughts about both of them both of
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
these bills that we were talking about
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
is that they do pretty different things
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that they are
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily have appropriate substitutes
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
for each other um you know we came into
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
these discussions on S SP 255 thinking
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we wanted some you know narrow but
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
substantial tweaks um that could make
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
that Bill had a more actionable and
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
workable for consumers um one of those
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
things was lowering the threshold so
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
that the bill would actually cover
 
01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:04.839 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire that had
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
collected substantial amounts of
 
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.789 align:start position:0%
collected substantial amounts of
information

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
about uh consumers um and we're happy to
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
see that that amendment was included um
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
but I think in section 507 H2 the new
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
exemptions kind of you know we we talked
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
about this they are
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
now kind of um completely eliminating
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
from coverage the businesses that we
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
think that this legislation is intended
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
to cover so um the bill now exempts
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
businesses that collect personal
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
information in connection with providing
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
a cellular service so that's Verizon
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
your phone
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
company um information in connection
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
with providing electric water other
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
utilities internet service providers
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
again that's companies like Verizon and
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
Comcast cable TV streaming services that
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
collect a lot of information about us
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
like Netflix and Hulu and then I think
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
probably most notably of all for us is
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
the social media companies would now be
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
exempt as we know those are the
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
companies that collect the most you know
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
can I can I no I'm sure yeah I'm sure go
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
ahead so assuming that your firm with
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
wanting optin protections for those
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
types of businesses which is now
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
contemplated in HB
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
314 I don't NE necessarily see the logic
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
of continuing to move s SP
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
255 or you know to put it another way
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
excluding from 314 the Protections in
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
255 that are very detailed and and would
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
create a lot of protections for
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
consumers so um you know that includes
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
stuff like providing a right to access
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
correct and delete those are kind of the
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
Baseline consumer rights that are in 255
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't be in
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
314 um and there's other aspects of 255
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
that aren't reflected in 314 as well you
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
know doing risk assessments for high
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
risk Pro uh processing of data having an
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
appeals process if you're um optin is
 
01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
rejected or you feel like the company
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
isn't honoring your requests um and so
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
now we kind of have 314 without that
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and we have 255 and it's kind of
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
unclear who 255 would apply to now um I
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
think there's likely a pretty small
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
Universe of companies that aren't
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
covered by those exemptions and but
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
nevertheless would be collecting that
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
amount of information and now you're
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
putting on those companies which are
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
like companies that are likely to still
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
be in 255 are probably going to be
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
mediumsized businesses they kind of now
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
have all of these owners requirements
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of people when they
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
were drafting this bill were thinking
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
would apply to the biggest companies
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and so I think there might be a
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of a mismatch there um you
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
know and then in
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
314 the whole concept of the opin hinges
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
on whether the business discloses
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
information to another person um just
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
from a drafting perspective I I didn't
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
see that disclose was a defined term um
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
and so that if you want to continue with
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
3114 might be something to look at
 
01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be a heavily
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
debated area what does disclose mean
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
does that mean to sell does that mean to
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
share um that's a term that would
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
typically be uh defined and and same
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
thing with with the recipient a person
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh isn't defined term in the bill either
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
um another thing on 314 I would just say
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
that I think it might be a little
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
confusing for just the average Joe
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
reading this you know the the framework
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
of that bill says that the still social
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
media companies and all the companies
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
that we Exempted from 255 are third
 
01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.669 align:start position:0%
that we Exempted from 255 are third
party

01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
collectors that doesn't necessarily jive
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
with the fact that those are companies
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
that are directly collecting information
 
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.270 align:start position:0%
that are directly collecting information
from

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
consumers um so I think that just might
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
be another kind of confusing drafting
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
aspect of the bill um yeah I you know I
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of jumbled thoughts but I'll
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'll probably stop there and um I guess
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of left with the
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
impression that uh more work would be
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
needed to to make either of these
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
workable that you left with the
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
impression that what that I think more
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
work it would be necessary to make
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
either of these workable now that we've
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
kind of um Exempted a large segment from
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
one and added it to another Well th
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for um for your
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
comments I understand that you haven't
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
had time to
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
um look at at this proposal um um and
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
Ponder how how to make it better and I'm
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to that and I also
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
understand that you have a very
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
important focus in terms of the consumer
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
um and and respect that very much um I I
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
do have a question that I'd like to ask
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
you you know we in um in Hampshire think
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
about what happens when you build a wall
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
what you're Walling in and what you're
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
Walling out um and
 
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.990 align:start position:0%
Walling out um and
uh

01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh what we try to do in this draft
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
and uh perhaps we
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
completely failed I always willing to
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that is
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out who we were Walling in and
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
who we were Walling out we did not want
 
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.830 align:start position:0%
who we were Walling out we did not want
to

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.910 align:start position:0%
to
have

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.709 align:start position:0%
have
[Music]

01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
um uh companies in the private sector um
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
be confused
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
about um what they were supposed to do
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
we were trying to make it as simple as
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
possible we recognized the
 
01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.470 align:start position:0%
possible we recognized the
differences

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
amongst uh the private entities who
 
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.510 align:start position:0%
amongst uh the private entities who
would

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
have reason to have access to
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
information and hope that we divided
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
them in a way that made
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
sense um
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just sitting here thinking of my
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful father-in-law who said um he
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
didn't make the capitalist system but he
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
does try to live by the rules and the
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
irony of course is it's very hard to do
 
01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.709 align:start position:0%
irony of course is it's very hard to do
that

01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
um I do want to point out to you and
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
this follows up on something that
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew uh said earlier
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
this small group will go to our full
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee we will then go to the Full
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
House and if in the fullness of time the
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill passes the bill would then go to
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate and open again to
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
improvements fine-tuning that might give
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
you some time Mr Schwarz to figure out
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
the wording that you think would be best
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
and and that's because we do operate a
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
pretty open system here um longer speech
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
than I plan to give but I did want to
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
for being very honest and saying you
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to really go through it
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
but these are questions that you have
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
and you're not sure about the answers
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I respect that very much does anyone
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
have any questions or comments for Mr
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
Schwarz yes representative Lyn yeah no I
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
share what the chair has said and I you
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
know I understand that we're kind of
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
catching you without having had a little
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
chance to sort of look at this carefully
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
and and you know you may if you may have
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
further comments or thoughts as this
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
goes on the one thing I guess I would
 
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
goes on the one thing I guess I would
say

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
is I you know I your the concerns that
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
you express about things
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
that companies that would now be
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
excluded from 2 55 the the the the
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
things that a company that is subject to
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
255 needs to do and your concern that
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
we've now taken a number of those
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
companies out of it um I mean that's all
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
think provides the answer to your
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
concerns is what we've said in
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
314 is those companies can't disclose
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
they they're in other words all of the
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the the things that you want
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
protection for in
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
255 I think 314 essentially says no
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's no if you've got private
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
information fine um but you you can't do
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
anything with it so to speak unless
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's been an affirmative consent um
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah so in terms of the opt-in
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
versus opt out I think that's true and
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
you yeah plenty of people would make the
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
argument that that opt-in is stronger
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
than an opt out I guess what my point
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
also is though is that 255 does a lot
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
more than just determine the optin
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
versus opt out question like I said it
 
01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
gives all of these other Baseline rights
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
the right to access correct delete your
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
information and now we're carving all of
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
those companies out from having to
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
provide even though those Baseline
 
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
rights so I think that is a a starter
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
problem another problem is that you know
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
bills like 255 we have issues with them
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
but they also have thought about these
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
issues very thoroughly and so you know
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
in three was it 18
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
34 uh 314 yeah in
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
314 yes you make an op in for uh for
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
consent but then there's nothing about
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
what a receiving entity is restricted
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
from doing if they if the comp if the
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
consumer opted in so like a bill like
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
255 addresses that by saying that a
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
controller has to make you know
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
contractual agreements with their third
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
parties and processors that prevents
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
those entities from doing certain things
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
when they've received information and
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
that type of kind of Downstream uh data
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
transfer uh ecosystem is not kind of
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
contemplated in in 314 at all kind of
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
just says like yeah you can opt in to
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
consent and then it doesn't put any
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what a recipient of of
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
that information would do so that's
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
just um me pointing out that there's
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a larger kind of legal landscape
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that has been left out if once you take
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
those entities out of a bill like
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
255 oh yes no no no you raised you those
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
are very good points that you just
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
raised let me let me just ask you this
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
um this would be a subject for for the
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
committee obviously to have a further
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
discussion but
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
what one of the thing one of the big
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
things that we were concerned about is
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
in drafting the the the two bills and
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
the the two amendments the way we did is
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
to not have a
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
company that be subject to both U
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
because they you know that could create
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
confusion but as I hear what you're
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
saying would it correct your
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
problem if we
 
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.149 align:start position:0%
problem if we
said

01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:18:10.159 --> 01:18:13.229 align:start position:0%
said
um

01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in 255 If instead of
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
removing from 255 all the companies that
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
are cover CED by
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
314 we left them in
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
255 but simply
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
255 is intended to
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
exempt any companies covered by
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
314 from complying with
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
314 yeah yeah I I think that makes a lot
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
of sense um so then they have to comply
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
with they have to comply with both with
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
both but they're dealing with separate
 
01:18:59.950 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
issues I mean one's about what you do
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
with the consumer's data and the other
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
one's about if you can give information
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
to the government so I always kind of
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
viewed these bills of having separate
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
aims and so to take one tranch of
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
companies out of one and put it in the
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
other I think that then you're not
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
neglecting the other issue okay so I
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
think they can and they can comply with
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
both I
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.470 align:start position:0%
both I
think

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
so that would be the only wording that
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
would change in 255 is to have it comply
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
with 314 is that is that what you were
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
saying yeah I mean basically it would in
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
other words I think what it would do is
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
take the the let me
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
find let me find the language that I'm
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
um page five page five uh five at the
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
um well you know what you might have to
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
in what I have in mind you because of
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
the language I have in mind you might
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
have to it might not fit in in G but but
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
in other words it would be language that
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
would say something
 
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.390 align:start position:0%
would say something
like

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
chapter shall prevent uh nothing in this
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
chapter shall
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
excuse a company subject to
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
314 from complying
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
314 um from from from complying with 314
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
and and and it might also have some
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
language saying that um something like
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know if um companies that are
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
314 are are required to comply
 
01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.390 align:start position:0%
314 are are required to comply
with

01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
whichever what with whichever uh uh
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
chapter either the one covered by 255 or
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
the one covered by 314 which affords the
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
greater privacy protection to
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
individuals so I think that you know
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
again I I'd have to think about the
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
language a little bit but it would
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
essentially it would say that companies
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
can be subject to both 255 and 314 but
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
if they're within the orbit of 314 then
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with its greater
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions some companies won't be
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
within the orbit of 314 and so they'
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
only be subject to 255 but some would be
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
both and of course you understand we
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
won't be using 314 or 255 but we would
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
be using because those bills would cease
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
to exist what we we would be using are
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah and I think there I mean I'm
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
happy to look through it but I think
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
there might actually already be language
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
in 255 that kind of reserves a
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
business's like ability to respond to a
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
a legal request or something so it might
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
there might already be something in
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
there that accomplishes a purpose but I
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
look thank you anything else yes
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative ch
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh just adding on I I I think that was a
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
great discussion around around how these
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
two interact in ways I I'm wondering
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
also um since the 255 has the sort of
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
universal opt in or opt out sort of
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
concept built into it whether we should
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
also consider how that would interact
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
with the opt in provision of the other
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
bill um so that if you opted if you
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
universally opted say in uh you know
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
across the board would would you still
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
be afforded the right to be notified and
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
opt out it's just just the thought that
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
builds if we if we go down that route
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
but um but I like the ability to
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
universally opt out to be applied
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
because it takes the burden off people
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
to constantly you know make decisions
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
stand

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
stand
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
comments any other
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
yes you have to press get the red light
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
on there you go great thank you um my
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
name is David Miller I'm a resident of
 
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
straford County and uh today I'd like to
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
speak both as a resident but also um on
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of an organization called restore
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
the fourth um it's a nonprofit uh
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization um for restoring
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the strength of the Fourth Amendment uh
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of protecting uh private
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
citizens data from government intrusion
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
and three now that 314 is in scope here
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
I think Matt was presenting Mr Schwarz
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
was presenting on uh the rights of
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
consumers from the private sector and uh
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
I do want to thank the committee for uh
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
strengthening um what I think uh Federal
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Ron widen has been trying to do
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
for a while is preventing the flow of
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
information from the private sector to
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government um restore the
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
fourth is I don't want to be picky
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely but are you here um as a
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
lobbyist oh uh would that sorry if that
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
would classify me as a lobbyist I will
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
leave out that angle and just present on
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
my own behalf um I I think that um
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
unless you are registered as a lobbyist
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
oh I see um
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh you might want to speak to yourself
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
and you can certainly acknowledge that
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
there are groups out there that are
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
concerned with this issue oh okay but
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
just you know because these records um
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
are kept you don't want to misstate who
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
you're representing here officially sure
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm sorry for for my La
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
familiarity I just want to you out of
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
trouble I yeah I've uh um not a member
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
but I have corresponded uh with them
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
about their thoughts on some of these
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
bills and let me represent myself then
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
resident of the state thank you so much
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
for informing me um all right so uh
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
representing myself as a um resident of
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
straford County um I uh have um of
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
course had limited time like everyone
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
here to uh review these bills and I
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank very much the subcommittee for
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that that uh might make
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
things a bit difficult for us uh but um
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
I just want to provide a little bit of
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
context for why it would be so important
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the um rights uh not just
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
of opt out but of amendment um uh corre
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
so correction of inaccurate records um
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
deletion uh and not just opt out from
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
transfer but also deletion uh and the
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
other enumerated uh rights in 255 are so
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
important to um apply to all companies I
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
understand that the wording that
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has suggested could
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
end up being a little bit more
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
complicated because um adding a single
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
section not fully exempting those other
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
entities that have opt-in requirements
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
might sort of conflict with the wording
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
in 255 regarding opt out requirements so
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
just to sort of provide additional
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
motivation for why it's so important to
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
add this additional wording and I I
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
agree that uh representative L suggested
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
wording is excellent and would probably
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
address most of the concerns here um
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
data Protection Law uh in Europe at
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
least dates back from about 1970 in the
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
German state of Hessa in 77 nationally
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
in Germany doesn't seem to have affected
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
their economy adversely um and uh
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
already in the 90s was passed on the
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
European level and the main intent there
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
um was to prevent ultimately um
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
government and private sector abuses of
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
um personal data by regulating the
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
entire Downstream data
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
flow to describe this more
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
fully um of course we cannot uh regulate
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
who we transfer data to out of state
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
because of the dormant Commerce Clause
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
um and we cannot regulate um what
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
foreign jurisdictions uh New Hampshire
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
operating company transfers data to
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
because that's a exclusively under
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
Federal Authority um and uh typically
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
the downstream transfer of data um in
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
Europe is regulated by having a list of
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdictions where the data
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
protection laws are considered adequate
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
to similarly protect the information so
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a contractual Clause that
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
says you need to have strong protections
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
if it's in a country where the legal
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
system wouldn't actually enforce that
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
contract obviously it doesn't protect
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
European residents data in New Hampshire
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
we can't do all that and so it becomes
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
important to have a consistent mechanism
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
of restrictions on the downstream
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
transfer of data so if you have
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
different regulations as would be
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
proposed in the current written text
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
presented to us this morning three for
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
certain sets of companies versus
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
others you draw a graph basically some
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
arrows between the different companies
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
and what data is transferred and there
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
end up being holes where certain
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
categories of data can be transferred
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions and it becomes
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
possible to use the loopholes that
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
result uh to to end up with data
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
reassembled out of jurisdiction in a way
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
that is adversely actionable by
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
companies or government against citizens
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
so in order to make those data flows
 
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
regulatable by the state of New
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is necessary to cover as
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
many of those entities as possible with
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
that basic list of Rights first of all
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
the obligation that contractual
 
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
commitments have to be made for
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
Downstream flows which is covered by 255
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
and not by 314 and also that it every
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
stage of those flows New Hampshire
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
consumers which there a lot more
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
companies covered now with a 35,000 uh
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh um uh threshold so I thank the
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
committee for adding that as well um you
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
have to uh make sure that all those
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
companies also allow an individual to
 
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
correct their data If it's incorrect or
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
to delete it um and all the other
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
so-called data subject access request
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
rights um so I would support uh 255 if
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
this um am if the suggested Amendment
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
were introduced one more thing
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
quickly um on a technical level um and
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
on privacy level I'm very concerned
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
about one of the three insertions of
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned of the Secretary of State I
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that the Secretary of
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
State should set
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines um on the uh procedures and
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
user flows uh however I am concerned
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
that is a secretary of state defining a
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
single type of mechanism uh to
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
technically strained for all the
 
01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
different companies uh to allow the opt
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
out and the reason for that is this in
 
01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.229 align:start position:0%
out and the reason for that is this in
European

01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
European
 
01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:30.870 align:start position:0%
European
legislation

01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh you a company is not allowed to ask
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
for additional proof of uh for example
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
an identity document or the identity of
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
the individual or let's say their New
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license um in order
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
to show that they are the person who is
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
making the request whatever is the
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
normal mechanism for logging into to
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
authenticate to the service is has to be
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
adequate because otherwise you're
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
passing a privacy bill that encourages
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
additional collection of
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
information by those people who care the
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
most about their privacy and clearly
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
that will discourage them from pursuing
 
01:31:04.239 --> 01:31:05.229 align:start position:0%
that will discourage them from pursuing
their

01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
rights so that restriction is not
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
present in either of these bills and
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
asking the Secretary of State to specify
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
a user flow technically that every
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
company has to follow means that it
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
would be the same procedure for a
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
company that already knows that that
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
knows the user by their email or another
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
company that got the data from a third
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
party and has to verify that the
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
individual has a certain ID and that
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
would not be appropriate thank
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
much it's clear that you're quite
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about what's happening all
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
area um any other thank you any any
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Miller not thank you
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
with again for being
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
else okay so now we have
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
um we have the Senate
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill and um what differs for our
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee action now is that in the
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
house bill we had this version that we
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
could vote on right now there seems to
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion I think there is a suggestion
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
um of ways that we could improve the
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill and on
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
my right sitting here I see um the
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
former Supreme Court Justice are working
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
hard on his
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
opinion um to give us language I don't
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
want to rush you
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
do you think you have language now that
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
you would be comfortable asking us to
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
include in our proposed amendment or do
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
you need more time you know what I I
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
think let let me let me this is a really
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
rough draft but and so I I think it I
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
probably would not be appropriate for us
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
to vote on this language because there
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
might be you know I as I think about it
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
more I might have some some other but I
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
think what I what what I think would
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
make sense and I ask anybody in the
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
audience if they have a you know a
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
different view to to uh if they think
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's something missing from this but
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
suppose the language in
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
255 said something like
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
this companies that are covered by
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
255 and also by
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
314 shall comply with both statutes with
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
the exception that to the extent there
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
is a there is a conflict between these
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
two statutes companies that are subject
 
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.430 align:start position:0%
two statutes companies that are subject
to

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
314 must comply with the statute that
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
protection so that that I think would
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
say for examp that would say that
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
companies that are subject to 314 that
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
that which is the opin um
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
they they have to comply with the 2 all
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
the 255 things about correcting your
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
information getting your information you
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
know knowing having your information
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
deleted they have to do all that um but
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
they also if they're whereas 255 has an
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
opt out Pro provision whereas 314 it's
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
opt in if you're one of the companies
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
one of the more limited companies that's
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
subject to 314 you have to comply with
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
its greater privacy protection which
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be the opt in as opposed to the
 
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
opt out I think
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that would would
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
um would would do it um and I'm I'm just
 
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh this is my it's okay of
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
course this is my suggestion um we can't
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the amendment it makes no sense the
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
amendment for us to use 255 and 314 what
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment would have to do would
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
have to be drafted um in such a way as
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
to refer to the RSA
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
sections um because the independent
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
existence of the two bills
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
disappears um and so that requires you
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
know some
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
careful uh review to make make sure that
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
we have the right sections in there so
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
this is my
 
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.030 align:start position:0%
this is my
proposal

01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to agree of course
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
um my proposal would be that we asked
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn to
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
draft to come up with the language that
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to be
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
added to uh
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
255

01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
255
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
um he uh he's free to share it with all
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
of us but we can't discuss
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
it in private so you know that's all
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
what that would mean then is for the
 
01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
today um and I of course would be very
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
um we leave today's discussion of 255
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
saying that um we are comfortable with
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
the draft Amendment with certain
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
additions and that would just be our
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
report for this meeting and that we come
 
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.310 align:start position:0%
report for this meeting and that we come
together

01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.750 align:start position:0%
together
at

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
930 which is always very good for
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Divine she likes
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
nothing more than 9:30 in the morning
 
01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.030 align:start position:0%
nothing more than 9:30 in the morning
um

01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
um uh well I mean to be here um and that
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
or even at a quarter of 10 on the
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
morning of the
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
8th and we having seen the language
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
before would be ready as a subcommittee
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
to vote on it and assuming that we can
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
accept that Lang language then we would
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
be free on the 8th to present to the
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
full committee the amendment that we
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
agree on other than that we would have
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
to have another meeting and all while I
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
love your company and I'm sure you love
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
mine I don't think any of us need extra
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
meetings um does that does that meet our
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
requirements so
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
we can work on that language we would
 
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
then get it to OS what we would have
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
then to vote on on uh a quarter of 10
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
even on on the eth would be the final
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
language you will have seen it before
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
but we would not have discussed
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
it um and then the full Committee in its
 
01:38:42.679 --> 01:38:45.229 align:start position:0%
it um and then the full Committee in its
work

01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
session could review that does that does
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
that meet everyone repres I can't see
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
you does that is that okay with
 
01:38:52.679 --> 01:38:54.350 align:start position:0%
you does that is that okay with
you

01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay that being the
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
case we are ready to send to
 
01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.070 align:start position:0%
case we are ready to send to
OSS

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
OSS
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
314 as amended in the way that we've
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
agreed to to get a final Amendment and
 
01:39:13.159 --> 01:39:14.589 align:start position:0%
agreed to to get a final Amendment and
then

01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
um we will work on this change which we
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
would then send to OS for them to have a
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
final Amendment and those amendments
 
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.589 align:start position:0%
final Amendment and those amendments
would

01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:39:26.599 --> 01:39:29.109 align:start position:0%
would
be

01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
um in the com in the subcommittee's name
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
or however ol will you never can tell
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
what they'll say but um I mean you know
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
who knows
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
um uh whichever name is appropriate and
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
we would then come together on the 8th
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee for a few minutes to
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
approve the final language and and then
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
be able to go to the full committee to
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
present it does that cross all the te's
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
eyes everybody okay with that okay Mr
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
Miller you have something you want to
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
add could you please come here because
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
there are people who are watching this
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
breath thank you and um I think some of
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
my prior points Also may not have made
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
clear but I'm relatively happy with the
 
01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
clear but I'm relatively happy with the
outcome

01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
um the reason that I was mentioning the
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
history in Europe was not just for
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
trivia um but because uh the of the
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
importance of uh each node in the graph
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
of a data flow having in flowchart so to
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
speak uh having these similar
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
protections and uh we do have a mix
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
under the proposal of optins and opt
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
outs and that is almost fine because uh
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
optins are generally considered to be
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
stronger than opt outs but there
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
is one thing
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
missing in the way optin is
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
defined in 314 compared to other similar
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
legislation so in adpa the federal
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that didn't get past
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
Pelosi um excuse me oh there's a federal
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill called the American data protection
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
Privacy Act uh that has not yet been
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
passed corre correct there was a lot of
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support but it didn't get
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
past um the the chairwoman okay so in
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that bill uh similar to what uh we're
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
trying to you're trying to do here um
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
with this combination of of the two um
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
portions of of the RSA statute um there
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
are a certain set of stronger
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to these uh
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
large social media companies Etc and
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's a different set of requirements
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
for the smaller
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.709 align:start position:0%
for the smaller
ones

01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
ones
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
but there's also a data minimization
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
requirement and what that means
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
is it's a mechanism to prevent what's
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
called consent fatigue consent fatigue
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
is when every few minutes you get a
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
popup that says hey you want to let us
 
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
do this thing with your data and then
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
when you don't click it a few minutes
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
later you get another one and ultimately
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to enforce your rights if
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
you think you can't use a service unless
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh every few minutes you're willing to
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
SW something away that's bothering you
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
right so data minimization is a fairly
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
basic part of data Protection Law for
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
the last 50 years and this is the
 
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.550 align:start position:0%
the last 50 years and this is the
requirement

01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
that it is actually a data controller's
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
burden to make sure that they're not
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
asking for more than they need to
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide the service and that is missing
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
here from both 314 and
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
255 and by leaving that out we create a
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
government the government creates an
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
incentive in the private
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
sector for companies to try to use
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
consent fatigue to obtain consent for
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
excessive collection processing and
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
transfer of information and that is a
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
concern that I have with the current
 
01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
concern that I have with the current
proposed

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
setup thank you could you tell me in the
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
um to try to fill the void by lack of
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
action in the federal level is that data
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
minimization um uh in each of the State
 
01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.430 align:start position:0%
minimization um uh in each of the State
uh

01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
laws uh data minimization has
 
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
been successfully lobbied out of the
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
majority actually that's not what I
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
asked I asked is it in the state law it
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
is in California yes in California and
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh the subsequent bills have been
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
crafted to not include it um it is under
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
consideration in uh the Massachusetts
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
and Main legislatures at present which
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
has a potential to influence uh Regional
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
compliance great thank you that is very
 
01:44:00.679 --> 01:44:01.870 align:start position:0%
compliance great thank you that is very
helpful

01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
information appreciate that anybody yes
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah just just one
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
question on that point and I think goes
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
back to the point I was interested in
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
earlier with the concept in 255 of
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
universal opt-in or Universal opt out
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
does that mitigate the consent f
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
question without the concept of
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
minimization um not unless there's a uh
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
clear legislative uh imperative to uh a
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
clear imperative in the legislation that
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
companies cannot employ consent fatigue
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
to attempt uh to gain consent and uh
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me that that are you
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
referring to particular wording that you
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
requirement my understanding in 255 was
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the way it's worded it would allow
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
there to be technology used that would
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
allow you to sort of universally opt in
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
or universally opt out whatever be your
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
preference for
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
um for data sharing in in in general and
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know whether essentially it
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be something you would set say in
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
a browser my understanding that you that
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
would be then applied across the board
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
and and hope I'm understanding that
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
correctly so because I I agree with the
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
concept of consent fatigue being you
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
know a difficulty both for privacy and
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
for just the logistics of of people's
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
lives uh that's an excellent point so
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
with regard to that particular portion
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
of 255 my concern here is that the
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't correspond to that
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to the protection in 314
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
if wording were to be added in 255 that
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
would ensure that those requirements
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
applied also to the opin provision of
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
314 that might depending on the wording
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
address this concern but one additional
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
thing that I'd like to to mention is I
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
think you know on all sides of this
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
issue everyone agrees that legislation
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
and Technology move at different the
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
legislative process and Technology move
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
at different Paces right and uh sure
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
when we talk about browsers um there is
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
a thing called do not track that
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
resulted from years of negotiations by
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
people setting web standards in a lot of
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
different countries Milla Foundation was
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
a big actor but it was their own kind of
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
private sector standards legislative
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
process and the fact is that people
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
access the internet from a lot of
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
different Services there is no such flag
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
on all mobile os's there's no such flag
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
on Internet of Things there's no such
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
flag on your refrigerator that people
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
can hack to get your email so um and we
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
have no idea what what signals will be
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
available to be sent from various
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
devices and programs a year from now so
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
um relying on that may not
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you very much
 
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you very much
anything

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
else if not um then
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
um we'll end this
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um meeting we will meet
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
again at um and it will be posted at at
 
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.669 align:start position:0%
again at um and it will be posted at at
um

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
9:45 on
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
the morning of November 8th at which
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
time um we will vote on um our proposed
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
255 and does that I think does that
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
complete our business does anybody have
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
anything else that they'd
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
like no then
 
01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
um we we
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
are finished we're
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
you
