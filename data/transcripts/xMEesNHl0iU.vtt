00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
during this term
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
it would be for the for the the next
 
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
it would be for the for the the next
term

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
so no somebody would have to file a file
 
00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
so no somebody would have to file a file
in

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%

okay all right so and any discussion on
 
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
okay all right so and any discussion on
that

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative donald trump it was
 
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:24.950 align:start position:0%
representative donald trump it was
cottonville

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
cottonville
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
i do have madam chair two brief updates
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so knowing that
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately covett had sort of
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
stopped any of the discussions that we
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
had talked about
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
post um the hearing of connecting with
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
different organizations that could
 
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
different organizations that could
participate

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
in looking at how to better
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
assess finding um over the summer
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
over the year summer i did have an
 
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
over the year summer i did have an
opportunity

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
to reach out to two local
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game lieutenants one that lives
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
in brentonia in my district
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
and is the the coordinator for
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
district two and then the coordinator
 
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
district two and then the coordinator
for

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
my region district three um and i talked
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
with both of them
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
from sort of an on the ground point of
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
view that they felt that this was
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile um and they both said the
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
same thing which was
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
you know have you reached out to colonel
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
jordan and they said
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that was the ultimate goal if cova
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
didn't exist that we would have had a
 
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.350 align:start position:0%
didn't exist that we would have had a
meeting

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
with colonel jordan and and paul
 
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
with colonel jordan and and paul
sanderson

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
sanderson
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about how the state agency
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
could give us insight into
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
moving these five increases along
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
so that's one bit of anecdotal evidence
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the on the ground fish and game
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
wardens felt that this was
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
worthy um the second one was i did have
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
a brief conversation
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
and a variety of topics with the new
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
head of society for protection of new
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire for us jack savage
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
and told him of this bill and he said
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
he thought that spinif would support
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
anything that helps
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
fish and game better manage and protect
 
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.069 align:start position:0%
fish and game better manage and protect
our

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
wildlife and our our natural
 
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.590 align:start position:0%
wildlife and our our natural
surroundings

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
surroundings
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
so it did a little work but we couldn't
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
do much else
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
i also had a meeting with the new
 
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
i also had a meeting with the new
director

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
for fish and game as well as
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner eric stoll
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
and paul sanderson on a totally
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
different matter but
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
this bill came up and they are also
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking forward to
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
working with representative egan on
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
future legislation so that
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
it can the mechanism for
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
um for managing this bill
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
could be worked on in a better way
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
to actually be of an advantage to new
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
so i do see a hand
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
so i think what i'm any any other
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
so i think what i'm going to do so that
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go from hearing to
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
executive session i think i'm going to
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
1585 open the hearing on hb 1433
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll do an executive session for
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
both of those bills at at the end of
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
this hearing so um representative
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
shewett i see is
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the attendees and so i would ask
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative stewart if you wanted to
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
just give us a brief
 
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.150 align:start position:0%
just give us a brief
um

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
review of the bill since it was your
 
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
review of the bill since it was your
bill

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair uh yes it was
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
my bill
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm still thinking that
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
we should try and do something on this
 
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.470 align:start position:0%
we should try and do something on this
um

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
it deals with the idea was to deal with
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
the population of ticks
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
in the state um and i had
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
talked to different people from
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
different state agencies
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
this bill had a different thrust than
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
most of the bills dealing with ticks
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
most of them had to do with dealing with
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
the diseases
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
that ticks cause my idea was to try and
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
control the proliferation
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
of ticks as a preventative measure
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i had spoken with the various people
 
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.069 align:start position:0%
and i had spoken with the various people
named

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
named
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill to serve on the commission
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
to try and come up with ways that we
 
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
to try and come up with ways that we
could

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
control the population of ticks
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
and still not adversely affect
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
pollinators for example bees and so
 
00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
pollinators for example bees and so
forth

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
other insects that are useful
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
um i do recall i believe it was at your
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
executive session that representative
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
eisner i think had
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
a large report that had been put out by
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services and i didn't
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
get the chance to ask because you were
 
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
get the chance to ask because you were
executing

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
executing
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
but i was curious it seemed to me that
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
from what i learned about that report it
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
dealt most
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
mostly with treatment of diseases
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
and the effects of the diseases that
 
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.069 align:start position:0%
and the effects of the diseases that
ticks

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
ticks
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
cause and i don't know if she recalls
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
that report if that's the case
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
or if it did actually deal with methods
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
to control the tick
 
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
to control the tick
population

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
may i respond what oh
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
um representative schuett yes
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
this lengthy report not only addresses
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
the diseases
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
but it also recommends methods of trying
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
to control the diseases
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%

okay all right so um um
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think we can move into executive
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
session for both of these bills
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is no future
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed at this time
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
a whole new bill and you can um
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be there is a
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
september filing period
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
which might even be open now but um
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's been advised to just wait until the
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
november filing period so
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
um you have a couple months to to think
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i think the november filing period
 
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.350 align:start position:0%
and i think the november filing period
starts

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
starts
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um right after the general election
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
november 8th
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
around in there yeah okay representative
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
well i guess i just want to say that the
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
september uh period
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
ends tomorrow but you can uh
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
submit the lsr merely as a as a
 
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.950 align:start position:0%
submit the lsr merely as a as a
placeholder

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
placeholder
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
and then work on the legislation in the
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
november filing period
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think they though they
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
will look for some
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
um information along with that filing as
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
they do ask for complete information i
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if it has to be complete
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
complete but um so it can't just be a
 
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
complete but um so it can't just be a
title

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
title
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
supposedly one other thing um
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
while i'm speaking um just a reminder
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
each one of these
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh recommendations for the two bills
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
each one has to have a statement that
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
goes with it
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
um that will be printed in the house
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
calendar so the the
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
person who made the motion uh should
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
write up a
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
a statement explaining the committee's
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
rationale for their recommendation
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
and they should send that to the madam
 
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
and they should send that to the madam
chairman

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative egan would you please
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
write up a little statement about
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the recommendation for your bill
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
and uh representative eisner if you
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
could write write up a little
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
um statement uh for
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
1433 and where do we forward that to man
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
of chair
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
to me okay yeah and i'll i'll get it
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
today or
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
um joel is there i mean
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
i think you want it fairly quickly but
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be today does it
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
no i mean it it the the deadline is
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
isn't for a while
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
for committees to report but it would be
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
a good idea to do as
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
soon as possible or you know a
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable length of time so
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
right but but don't stress out about it
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful day go outside do it
 
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.250 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
[Laughter]

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
i think that pretty much concludes the
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
business for fish and game
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
