00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you would all please um rise to join
 
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the public hearing for
 
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 59 and welcome representative
 
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you madam chair and
 
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
members of Criminal Justice and Public
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
Safety representative Dennis Manion
 
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
rocking M25
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
Salem this bill here before you is uh
 
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill that was filed last
 
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
year by chairman Roy um he
 
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
had he had it in two parts so he had one
 
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill with this bill and the bill that's
 
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
going to follow this so I separated them
 
00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
into two separate bills what this bill
 
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
essentially does is
 
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
ADD language in the RSA under first
 
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
degree assault and second degree assault
 
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
adding a subsection talking about
 
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
causing serious knowingly causing
 
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury to a uh Public
 
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
Safety official that would include law
 
00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 align:start position:0%
enforcement paid firefighters on call
 
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
Firefighters EMS Personnel uh in raising
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
the penalty in the situation which a
 
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault to a class A
 
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and then in the
 
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
section that applies to second degree of
 
00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
salt it would be knowingly or recklessly
 
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
causing bodily inur injury or
 
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
unprivileged physical contact to the
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
same people law enforcement officer paid
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
firefighter volunteer on call
 
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
firefighter or EMS people um
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
so obviously in today's culture there's
 
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of anti- police
 
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh rhetoric going on and this is a way
 
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
for us to protect our Public Safety
 
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
people not just law enforcement but EMS
 
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 align:start position:0%
and Fighters as well from assault while
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're uh in the course of their their
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
Duty um the bottom section of this bill
 
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
talks about extended term of
 
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
imprisonment we added that this year
 
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
because it will remove a similar section
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
in that part of the statute uh so there
 
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
are certain crimes that you can petition
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
for extended terms of imprisonment this
 
00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
is one of them for an enhanced penalty I
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
think it's cleaner being in the sections
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
of first degree and second degree
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
assault because uh it clearly defines
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the penalty should be in it um and
 
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
for the extended term of imprisonment
 
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
some things you need to do before that
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
applies you need to obviously notify the
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
defendant beforehand that you intend to
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
cleaner thank
 
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Manion
 
00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.830 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Manion
representative

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
pette I just have a question um does
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
this Encompass both M Municipal and
 
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
private as far as
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
EMS I believe it would so if you're if
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
you're private EMS and I don't know
 
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
there are some private EMS that also
 
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
work for municipal agencies um so I
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
would imagine it would apply to
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
lels thank you for taking my question um
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
would public servants such as
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves be included in
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
that not as I read it
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
no okay do you think they
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
should follow up I'm sorry um in a if
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
you want to file a separate bill on that
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
but I think this
 
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
specifically uh encompasses our Public
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
Safety people who deal with this on a
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
daily basis thank
 
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Newman yeah I just
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
have a question to follow on on your
 
00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 align:start position:0%
question um about the the other the paid
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
private um emss and stuff like that and
 
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
whenever you have a list you're apt to
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
leave somebody out and I'm wondering if
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
a more inclusive phrase might be
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to say like in first
 
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
responders for instance list them and so
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
you'd get the the people that are in the
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
list and put some more inclusive term in
 
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.590 align:start position:0%
list and put some more inclusive term in
there

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
that may maybe more broadly defines what
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
those people do so that if you missed
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
one you just don't have a list you have
 
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
also an inclusive phrase I don't know
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
what that would be but maybe First
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
Responders would be it or or or just
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
make the definition be positions like so
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
that you're not Li it to just that list
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
so so there is a list actually in the
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
statute uh but this language was taken
 
00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 align:start position:0%
from the existing statute under RSA 6516
 
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
extended term of imprisonment and it's
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
subsection G that says almost the same
 
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
exact language and that that list that's
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the in current statute is the list
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we used to create uh this bill okay
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question um
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
how does the bill uh address situations
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I know this comes up frequently not
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
just for EMS Personnel but for police
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
and firefighters as well but encounters
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
with people who e are either having a a
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis or who are under
 
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
the influence of a drug that
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically Alters their behavior like
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
PCP or something like that
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
so in the situation where it's mental
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
health uh this this
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
knowingly is a high standard a coupable
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
state of mind to uh reach um so if
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
someone were to be charged with that
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
obviously that would be taken into
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
consideration during trial um as far as
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
somebody on under the influence of
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol or drugs that's not considered
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
the defense in New Hampshire for any
 
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
Newman thank
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
you and just to comment on that these
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
penalties are not mandatory minimum so
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
therefore I think in the mental case
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
issue the the judge would have
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
discretion not to assign a felony and
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
and take the proper action in sentencing
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that that's how I
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
yes present appr you good any question
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about jumping up in that
 
00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.830 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about jumping up in that
seat

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay everyone set see representative n
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm concerned a
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
little bit so I I understand that
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
knowingly would be um you know that
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
would speak to the intent but recklessly
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
to me is a little more concerning um as
 
00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
to me is a little more concerning um as
far

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
as you know I I don't know if you could
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
comment on you know what what would be
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
an example of recklessly um and also you
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
I think that you would have to have some
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
type of standard where first of all they
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
know that it is a law enforcement
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
officer an EMS or or something like that
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
I think if they're not in uniform or not
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
on duty at that time um but this still
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
includes people who are not um on duty
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
at that time or in uniform but it but
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
the person would need to know that they
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
are um that that is the profession that
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
they do um but then also to the idea of
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
of recklessly and kind of how that might
 
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
of recklessly and kind of how that might
play

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
out as far as identification
 
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
you would have to know that it was a law
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer or another Public
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
Safety official uh for this to apply but
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
recklessly is a coupable state of mind
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
just below knowingly so it's purposely
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
knowingly recklessly negligently so you
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
would still have to have a significant
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
state of mind that you're you know what
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
you're doing is is is reckless or
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
knowingly and
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
um again being under the influence of
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
drugs or alcohol is not considered the
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
defense for a crime and in the case of
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
somebody with a m health problem that's
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to be taken into consideration as
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Newman mentioned um it's
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
not a mandatory minimum so that's
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that would wash out in trial
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I assume at that point there would
 
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
be more concerned with getting that
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
person assistance than putting them in
 
00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
person assistance than putting them in
jail

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
thanks I don't see any further questions
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manion thank
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
EMS some say I took Jesus off the cross
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
but that's not true but I've been in it
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
a long time over 40 years um and yeah
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
I've been hit a bunch of
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
times and we always take into the
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
into account were they in a medical
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
emergency or were they pissed off
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
because I ruined their house
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative you're on
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
TV you were angry or they were
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%

their
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
high or some other thing like that we
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
got in the middle of a domestic
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
recklessly they're mad they throw a
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
bottle and it hits me in the face yep
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
that's reckless and they meant to do it
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
they meant to throw
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
it their aim was not as good as it
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
should have been but it got me right and
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
I have one of my colleagues who will
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
tell you her story of a deliberate
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
action and and they been plenty of
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
actions and when we point it out to the
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
police they go yeah we're not going to
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
do anything because nothing will happen
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
with it so why bother so that's what
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
for right to give a consequence that if
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
you hit police Fire
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
EMS touch them without
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
permission knowingly recklessly or all
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the things there should be a consequence
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're just open
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
game and it happens big city small Town
 
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
game and it happens big city small Town
medium

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
medium
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
Town it happens everywhere so I believe
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
this is very important to put some teeth
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
behind hey don't hit
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
me right and some people have been beat
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
up pretty bad if you remember in in the
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
Elliott some guy has a brain injury and
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
can't work again because he got beat up
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
so bad so it happens and there needs to
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
be a consequence to protect the people
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
who are coming to help and I would
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%

you for taking my question um I have two
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
questions the first is um what you were
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
just saying about the um incidences kind
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
of being dismissed um and them saying
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
like it's not going to go anywhere could
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
you talk more to that like are they
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
saying like regular assault charges
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
are just not going to fly as well
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
because of your uniform essentially the
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
uniform and that it was a misdemeanor
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and way the baill
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
was they would be out before I completed
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
saying oh and can I do a followup
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
followup representative Mar um
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
Representative no the uh uh other
 
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
question was I can't recall uh where the
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
legis ation went last year do you know
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
didn't go anywhere it didn't come out of
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
this committee or or this body uh I
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
believe it was in the other side of the
 
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
wall that okay didn't like it or
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
something okay that's what I was all I
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
know is there's still no teeth in me
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting hit okay thank
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
lels thanks for taking my question um so
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
I would assume the current state of the
 
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
law it would be an assault charge is
 
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
law it would be an assault charge is
that

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
correct yep uh and I'm not sure exactly
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
how that gets charged but it's usually
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
kind of um under a misdemeanor or a
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
whatever followup followup do you feel
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
that because of your uniform and because
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
of your
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
status that you are more vulnerable
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
and more of a
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
Target in the general public yep sure
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
sure am I mean uniforms look
 
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
sure am I mean uniforms look
similar

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
um been called a cop and I have to go
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
hey no EMS if you had a gun pulled on me
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
and you know had to prove that hey this
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
is a medical bag not a gun so please
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't shoot
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
me right so and that happen happens more
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
often than you
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative n thank
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thanks for taking my
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
question I think um I I I first of all I
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
I agree that if we put you in a
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
situation where you are you know going
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
into a situation that's going to be um
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
tense and and things like this might
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
happen you know we're sending you into
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
that situation could you give me an
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
example of what that looks like for
 
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519 align:start position:0%
someone who is not in uniform and not at
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
that time on the
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
clock not in uniform and if I'm not
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
working this law doesn't apply to me it
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
may apply apply to police officers
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
unless I stop and render help right so
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm stopping to help somebody I don't
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
just walk up and start touching them and
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
and doing I identify myself I am an EMT
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here to help you can I help you
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
because I need their permission to touch
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
them right unless they're unconscious
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
and then implied consent comes in and I
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
don't need it right so I never touch
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
anybody without me asking that
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
identifying myself first
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
right and before I touch them I'm an
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
EMT I can help you would you like me to
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
help you most of the time they say
 
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.949 align:start position:0%
help you most of the time they say
yes

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
right yeah I think that would be so so
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
if I identify
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
myself and and they know I'm an
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
EMT and now they choose to punch me in
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
the face
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
because they don't like what I'm wearing
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
know then yeah this supplies right
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
because they know who I am and what what
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm doing for
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
them okay so where it where it talks
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
about I'm sorry followup I'm sorry it's
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
it it's okay
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative it's a follow up trying
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
to remind myself yes follow up please um
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
okay so where it talks about um acting
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
in in the line of duty or um commits an
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
act against a law enforcement officer
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not the officer is on duty
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
where the purpose was to harm the
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
officer because of uh his or her pre um
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
present or previous employment as a law
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
officer that would be so that's a law
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
officer that's not an EMT so that
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to me that applies to
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
police officers or a law enforcement
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
officer or however you look okay because
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's in there because bad guys
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
remember who put them in jail and may
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
actually come looking for them it has
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
happened in the past so I'm pretty sure
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
that's why that's in there so if the
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
officer walking down the street with his
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
family going to dinner and the bad guy's
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
walking this way and says oh I know you
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
and punches them then that this should
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
be definitely in place thank
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you I'd appreciate if you
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
could comment on a on a couple of things
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
um one is uh what is the necessity uh
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
first of all to arrest somebody without
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
a warrant and the other is how do you
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
define let's just do one at a time so we
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
can make sure we get them all answer for
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
you okay so the necessity without a
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
warrant should be asked to the police
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
office but I know that in certain
 
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.150 align:start position:0%
office but I know that in certain
um

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
incidents especially if they didn't
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
witness it they need to get a warrant so
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
unless this is written in the law
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
that they take my word and see my bloody
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
nose and three other people said that
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
guy just hit the EMT they don't need to
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
go get a warrant they can arrest them
 
00:17:38.919 --> 00:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
go get a warrant they can arrest them
right

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
there I believe that's how it goes I'm
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
sure the guys in uniform behind me can
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
clarify that so would it would it be
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
helpful to the to the committee if we
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
invited representative Manion to sit at
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
the same time with representative PR so
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
we can get our questions answered you
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
guys all okay with that okay represent
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
you so I'm going to guess that 92 and a
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
half% of the time any of these offenses
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
are going to incur occur in front of a
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
police officer but that being said we're
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to make arrests without a
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
warrant on any
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
felony with probable cause so that's
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
already the
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
law and I can also answer quickly the
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
question that uh representative uh lels
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
had brought up about the current state
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
career I had a judge who told us do not
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
bring any assault against police officer
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
charges we would just charge him a
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
simple assault or under the regular
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
statute because he will not entertain
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
them because that's our job to be
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
assaulted so that's why this is needed
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
snap followup followup representative
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
Muse so if I understand you correctly if
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
the penalty was not a felony you would
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
not be able to make a warrantless arrest
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes and one more
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
followup M um
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
unless unless we witnessed it thank you
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm curious about uh I I
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
understand uh you know the reason why
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
why knowingly or recklessly causing
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
bodily injury is in a bill like this um
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think we all can have a pretty good
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
idea what that what that would be what
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm having what I'm struggling with a
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
little bit is uh unprivileged physical
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
contact because the way the bill is is
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually written it seems like you know
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
on the one one hand you'll get charged
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
if you bash somebody in the in the nose
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
and break their nose and they get a
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
bloody nose and you injure somebody on
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
the other hand unprivileged physical
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
contact could be anything from
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
inadvertently brushing against somebody
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
a push some you know um and uh it just
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
seems I'm just curious why it why it's
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
in there at the same level as what seems
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
like a pretty serious assault yes so
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's in the second degree assault
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
level so the penalty is less that's to
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
be felony um the goal there was just to
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
prevent assaulting police officers um I
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
understand the concern there where
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking with the general
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
public any kind of unprivileged physical
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
contact the definition would mean any
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
kind of touching whatsoever um so it's
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
possible we can clarify that section of
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
it or remove it but the goal is to
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
prevent any assaults so you I mean you
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
could push an officer punch him and not
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
cause bodily injury should that be I
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
mean should that be okay should that be
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
a violation or misdemeanor that's why we
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
you so if this helps anybody um
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying this would also be a question
 
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.549 align:start position:0%
clarifying this would also be a question
so

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I I serve on a board for the for the
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
county level for for juveniles that
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
found themselves to be arrested and
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
there had been a situation where
 
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
there had been a situation where
um

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
somebody it was a domestic violent
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
situation but it actually involved
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
teenagers okay and when the officers
 
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.549 align:start position:0%
teenagers okay and when the officers
came

00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
the the the one youth was very concerned
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
because she felt as if she was getting
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
in trouble when she was the one that
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
called for
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
help and where the confusion was is she
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
she wasn't being in trouble but the
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
officers were trying to remove her from
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
the situation but she was very very
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
erratic she was just the situation was
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
bad and unfortunately for her and for
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
the officer she bit him and she did draw
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
blood was pretty
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
bad but they didn't BR the charges that
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
she had was because it continued after
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
they stopped it right like like you're
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
biting us right so there was a my
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
understanding was that was a pretty
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
clear line of the officers actually
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
trying to help her with the distress
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
that she clearly had and then there's
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
also this line of okay now you're just
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're just angry and taking it out on
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
us so in that
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
situation how is that handled or like
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
what is the the professional line where
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
an officer is clearly able to see this
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
person is under
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
distress they're not necessarily mad at
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
me they're just mad at the situation and
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
I happen to be in the way is there a
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
line there or is it
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
a matter of opinion where
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
professionalism comes into
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
play yeah so that's going to depend on a
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
lot of things the officers involved um
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak for all of them
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's also going to depend situation to
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
situation so I mean a situation like
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
that you obviously you're there
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
initially um
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
to either arrest her Tak her custody get
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
her help whatever your cause is but
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
there does reach a point where you can
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
sense that she's now turning on you
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
because you've got your hands on her and
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's not about the situation that
 
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
brought you there so that would be
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
probably where the line is where you you
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
give them a warning and a second warning
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they're still coming after you at
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that point where you would draw that
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
line and in that case if she's a
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile this doesn't change the
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
juvenile laws so she would still be
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
charged or not charged based on that but
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change anything else other
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
than the penalty for this offense so
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you thank you for that
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
explanation I think that might be
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
helpful to people that have some
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
questions oh who else anybody else good
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
represent what you
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
name so yeah please follow a pink card
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
you can go testify sure so I'll add a
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
little bit more because I know like in
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
the police
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
World um I actually have a ball spot on
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
the top of my head thanks for sharing
 
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
the top of my head thanks for sharing
and

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and and it came from a little old lady
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
who was in a nursing home trashed the
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
whole day room
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to get her out and
 
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
she needed shoes on so as I bent over to
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
help her with her shoes she grabbed on
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
and ripped it
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
out the thought of charging her never
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
even came across my mind because she was
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
obviously in a crisis and and was
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
just going with it so uh we take that
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
into account you know we're not here to
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
try and get everybody arrested arrested
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
that touches us is for the ones that do
 
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.630 align:start position:0%
that touches us is for the ones that do
it

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
deliberately knowingly or or whatever so
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so in that case if it was a
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
16-year-old male football player who was
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
6 foot2 and 280 PBS you might not give
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
him as much leeway as you would say you
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
know a 14-year-old 90 PB person who's
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
flailing and stuff like that a bite
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's different it's no matter who it's
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
coming from but uh yeah so it depends on
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
all those factors okay thank you all
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
right oh represent so close so close
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen representative n one more
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
question I promise sure um I do a lot of
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
work in um trauma informed care and
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and I think that a lot
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
of the situations that we're describing
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
it reminds me very much of you know to
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
to a um an extreme degree uh but
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
situations that might arise because of
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
someone's trauma do you guys go through
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
training trauma informed training as
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
police officers and
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
EMS yeah we do quite a bit yeah either
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
from the academy or from uh private
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
agencies that would come in and do
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
training yes we do okay thank you y
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative pette just so you know I
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
generally would would call any

Representatives first um but we've had
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
PE people that obviously are trying to
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
testify and they might be able to clear
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
up some of the questions that were asked
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%

suicide through support education and
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
advocacy on behalf of Nami New Hampshire
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
I am here today to speak in opposition
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 59 but not you know
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
completely in opposition to it just to
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
you know ask the committee to kind of
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
look at it slow it down and and see you
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
know how The Advocates can work with the
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
First Responders to get some language
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
that will work for everybody Nami New
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire firmly believes in and
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
supports the critical services that
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
First Responders provide for the safety
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
and well-being of our
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
communities oftentimes individuals in
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis find themselves
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
interacting with First Responders on
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
some of the worst days of their
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
lives we find that First Responders are
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
an important element of the Mental
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
Health crisis response and their safety
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
and well-being must be crucially
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
protected however we have significant
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
concerns that house bill 59 as
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
introduced will significantly and
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
punitively impact individuals with
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
mental health Crisis and Believe that
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
people in crisis deserve treatment in
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
support not to be arrested jailed or
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
facing disproportionate
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
penalties as you've heard under the
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
current law police cannot arrest a
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
person for a misdemeanor offense unless
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's committed in front of the officer
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
or if there's certain conditions that
 
00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:02.430 align:start position:0%
or if there's certain conditions that
are

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
met Senate Bill 59 would instead provide
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
that warrantless
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
arrests um for any individual accused of
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
assault of a first responder by raising
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
it to a felony level and that's what
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
makes it um makes them able to arrest
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
without the warrant is because um it
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
raises um simple assault to a uh felony
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
level in this uh bill
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier folks with mental
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
illness often interact with First
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
Responders on the worst days of their
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
lives and as such their actions may be
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
Reckless or unpredictable and may result
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
in bodily injury or more importantly the
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
unprivileged contact that you heard
 
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.070 align:start position:0%
unprivileged contact that you heard
about

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
um therefore we expect this bill would
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
cause more individuals with a mental
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
illness to often face the higher
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
penalties established in the bill bill
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
due to their frequent interactions with
 
00:29:00.919 --> 00:29:02.070 align:start position:0%
due to their frequent interactions with
First

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
First
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
Responders this bill would also make
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
obtaining release on bail more difficult
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
resulting in more folks with active
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
mental illness residing in jails around
 
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.190 align:start position:0%
mental illness residing in jails around
the

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
state while the K committee May
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
determine that there is a need to
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
provide increased protections for First
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
Responders there must also be a balance
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
of protecting the rights and the
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
freedoms of individuals with mental
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
illness and just by way of background
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
from 2021 to 2023 Nami New Hampshire was
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
involved in a stakeholder group
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
discussing a similar issue that's the
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
subject matter of this bill when it came
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
to health care
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
workers as a part of that effort in 2021
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
there was a committee to study workplace
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
safety and health care
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
settings um during the two years that it
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
met the legislative committee worked
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders including Nami New
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to come to a resolution that
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
prioritize the safety of healthcare
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
workers while also addressing the
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
concerns of mental health and the
 
00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:05.190 align:start position:0%
concerns of mental health and the
Disability

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
Disability
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates this resulted in language that
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
passed in Senate Bill 58 from
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
2023 and as we can learn from that
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
process changes in the law that may
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect the rights of
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
an already vulnerable population should
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
use time and careful consideration to
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that an axe isn't being used
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
when a scalpel could do
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
it is Paramount that people in
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis continue to have the
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
due process protections afforded to them
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
under the law and if house bill of 59
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
passes as is we expect that more people
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
in a mental health crisis would face
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
higher level charges and language in
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
county jails which would only serve to
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
exacerbate their crisis for those
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
reasons Nami New Hampshire is in
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as I said as it
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
is drafted and while I was back there
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not I am an attorney but I've never
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
on criminal law but while I was back
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
there I did look up the definition of
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
recklessly which is consciously
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
disregarding a substantial risk of harm
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
to others and when someone's in a
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis they may know that
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
flailing their arms around and touching
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
somebody is they're they're knowingly
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
doing that um they're knowingly flailing
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
their arms and I would you know as I
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
said I don't do criminal law but I would
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
be seriously you know concerned about
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh the standard that's in here um
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
you know if it was purposefully um that
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
might be different but we're really
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
concerned about the standard that's in
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
here because someone's just flailing
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
their arms around in a psychiatric
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
crisis and happens to hit but not injure
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
a first responder they could end up with
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
a felony on the record which would
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
seriously impact their ability to get
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
employment and to get housing and so we
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
just urge the committee just to slow
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
this down a little bit and allow The
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
Advocates to maybe work with the first
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
responder of community to come with a
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
come come to a resolution that everybody
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
can live with thank
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you Miss Stevens um have you
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
have you reached out to the sponsor of
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
the bill to to have a conversation with
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
them about the concerns or the changes
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see in there I
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
didn't reach out to the sponsor my first
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
um effort was to reach out to um the the
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
person who represents the police Chiefs
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
and was not able to connect with with
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
her in the time frame of when this bill
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
was being heard and could you share
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the so you had said um not
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
to take an axe when maybe a scalpel
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
would do so
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
it it seems from from the language in
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
the bill that there that there is a
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
scalpel now that is that is used um what
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
you would like to see I guess I should
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm just looking at it now I I
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
mean I think like I said the standard
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's being um identified in the
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
bill is concerning to
 
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.269 align:start position:0%
bill is concerning to
us

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
um bless
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
you I've got the wrong bill in front of
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
me here it is um the recklessly um
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
standard is concerning um um this one's
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
and then the unprivileged physical
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
contact is concerning because that is
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
simply you know touching
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
somebody without any um harm whatsoever
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the concerns and
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
also raising this to the felony level is
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
concerning you know it would be I think
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
we would rather work with the First
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
Responders within the warrantless arrest
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
statute itself to try to come up with a
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
car out in the warrantless arrest
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
statute that would allow for a
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest without being a
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
felony so those are some of our concerns
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
that we would like to you know talk and
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
sheer um again in the interest of uh
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
full disclosure uh Miss Stevens has The
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
Misfortune of Being a former student of
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
H she was a a teaching assistant so um
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that if the
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
words were instead of being knowingly or
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
recklessly it was purposely that would
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
be uh uh of that would address a lot of
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the circumstances if not all the
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances yes um purposely is a much
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
higher standard to reach and somebody
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
just flailing their arms around in a um
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis um wouldn't
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily it wouldn't be the standard
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know they wouldn't reach the level
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
of purposefully but again they would
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
potentially re reach the level of
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
recklessly so that is the concern follow
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
up followup um and it's fair to say that
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
this bill also addresses another
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
category of people that uh in my
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
experience being a police commissioner
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
the police deal with in a relatively
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis are those elderly people
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
who are suffering from uh Dementia or or
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the whatever the particular
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
term is and is not fully conscious of
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on around me around them PR
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
in slip
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
um this addresses that group too and the
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
concern is the same uh that recklessly
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
is too low a standard yes and I know
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
that um my colleague um miss Karen
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg will be uh discussing um
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's as a concern but yes that is
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
is one of the one of the groups that
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
also would be um caught up in this um
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we could end up with folks with
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
dementia in the county jail um and not
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
even knowing where they're at and what
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
the what's going on which would be a
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
huge concern for for them last
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
followup um are you familiar with the
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of services that would be
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
available to a person suffering from a
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
mental illness or in from Alzheimer's or
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
dementia uh while they're being held
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
pre-trial at a at a jail it's my
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that there aren't really

you see no further questions thank you
 
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.790 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
thank

thank
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak um
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
Kathleen pockette uh from Manchester and
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is important to me and my
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
family um because my I have two
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
daughters I was an EMS myself and I have
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
two daughters uh one's an EMT one's a
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
paramedic um and my husband has been a
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
paramedic for 38 years um and all three
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
of them have had have been injured or
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
have been hurt um so I'm hoping I have
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
some personal experience which may help
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Muse's question about
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
touching and also representative n's
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
question about being in plain clothes um
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
as far as a touching um one of my
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
daughters she was actually 19 years old
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
and she was in the back of an ambulance
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
with a patient and she and so her driver
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
so she's alone and her driver was
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
driving them to the hospital and um the
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
person that was driving had no idea that
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
the pass in the back the patient had my
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
daughter by the
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
throat um she wasn't
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
injured but it was intended to cause an
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
injury it was intended to seriously
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
injure her so thankfully somebody was
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
able to stop the ambulance get out of
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
the ambulance and intervene before she
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
got an injury so I think that's why that
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
touching um is very important because
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
she wasn't hurt thank God but that
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
physical touching was intended to injure
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
her um and as far as the um out of
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
uniform um like I said my husband uh has
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
worked for 38 years in EMS and he does
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
not work in the state intentionally um
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
because he's had episodes in the past
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
where he's had patients that he's ran
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
into in the grocery store um and not
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
everybody you know loves
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
EMS because either they don't take them
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
where they want or you know like uh
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative pu said you know you're
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
you're ruining their high as as they see
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
but you know you've just saved their
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
lives um and they're not happy so he's
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
actually had several incidentes with
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
people recognizing him out of
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
uniform um so he therefore for safety
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
his own safety he chooses to work out of
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you um and thank you
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I know you
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
know one thing that I'm very familiar
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
with is I just want to talk about kind
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
of this idea of like ruining somebody's
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
high right um and kind of drill down on
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
what that looks like because I do know
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that when people are resuscitated with
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
nooon sometimes um when they uh wake up
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
from that essentially when they come
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
back um they are flailing they are they
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what's happening they're very
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
very disoriented and so I just want to
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
kind of establish what that exactly what
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
that looks like cuz I can imagine that
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
being possibly interpreted by
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
some it can be but there's sort of a
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of a timeline cuz that's
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
something that I had experienced myself
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know somebody comes out and
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're flailing and they're mad but
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
usually several moments later they
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
realize that you know they're now sober
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
and it's usually upon that that they you
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
know at times not everyone obviously not
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
every single time and not everyone but
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is the time when they realized oh
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
you know I was high and now I'm not and
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's your fault so you know that initial
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
sort of waking up there can be flailing
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
in that but then there's that moment of
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
realization that comes a little bit
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
after okay and that's only that's only
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I'm here
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
Association of counties which is the
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
trade Association for all your elected
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
and appointed officials uh the
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
association is in support of this bill
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
but we would like to make one minor
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you add correctional
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
officers to this list while correctional
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
officers are considered law enforcement
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
officers in the past if they have not
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
been specifically listed they are not
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
included um certainly the um second half
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh counties are certainly
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
set up under the magistrate program to
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
handle the uh bail via judge or
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate so that would not be an issue
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
for counties certainly we do not want
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
people languishing in the County
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility Who are in mental
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
Health crisis but uh we feel that there
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
are procedures in place to handle that
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
bail situation if someone were to come
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
in um and as far as the felony that is a
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
policy decision is not a position that
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
the association is taking at this time
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
have representative n yeah I didn't talk
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
at all yesterday so I'm just up you're
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
question what uh representative sherff
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
said about pre-trial Services really
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
kind of struck a chord with me and I was
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you might be able to speak
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
to what exactly that would look like and
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
being able to identify whether it was
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
someone who was in a mental health
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
crisis in which case we wouldn't want
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
them to to be held in that situation
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for that question that's
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
not a decision for County Corrections
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a decision for the judge
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
or the magistrate who is seeing them
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
can I follow up real quick um because my
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
intention is not to say it's what I'm
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
really trying to ask is kind of what
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
that what that looks like if someone
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
does and that's not something that you
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable speaking
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
to thank you for the question I believe
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
I can answer your question if I don't
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
get it right try again so if someone
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
comes in last year this committee did
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinary work around House Bill 318
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
and set up the uh 13 crimes that are
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
listed that include first degree in
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
assault and second degree assault for
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
someone who would not see a bail
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner they would see either a
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
judge or a magistrate we've worked very
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
closely with the courts to set up those
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
procedures so if you come in during the
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
week um normal no normal hours within 24
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
hours you have to see a judge if you are
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
coming in on the weekends you have to
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
see the magistrate because obviously the
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
judges are not in their office um and we
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
have worked out a essentially a schedule
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
with the courts for every County to have
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
a specific time where if they have
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
someone who falls under those
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to set up a call so that
 
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
they can have their review done within
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
the time period that you all laid out in
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
318 last year um Counties have set up uh
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
virtual uh hearings so that way we don't
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
have to physically bring people to the
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
courts um we can do it over Zoom or some
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
other telephonic Communications does
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%

very

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
much representative PR I I realized you
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
were telling me you could answer that
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
question but if you could maybe after
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're all done just like address that so
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
we can let the people testify thank
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Karen Rosenberg
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
I am the policy director at the
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center which is our
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
state's protection and advocacy system
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities and I'm
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition to this
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill on behalf of the disability rights
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
Center I mean first I need to say that
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
um someone said not everyone loves EMS
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
providers I love them I understand their
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
jobs are so tough and and that they go
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
into situations intending to help people
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
save people's lives and and are entering
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes situations that end up being
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
harmful to them and that is terrible so
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
in no way um I mean I I I just I can't
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
imagine what that's like for them but
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is that this
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
bill if it passes as written is going to
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
have an unintentional really negative
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
horrible consequence on people who
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
experience various kinds of disabilities
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
as you heard from Holly Stevens from
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
Nami you know there's concerns about
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
people who are facing an emotional
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral mental health crisis and are
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
just hearing voices or having a a break
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
really with reality and are very very
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
agitated but I'm also concerned about
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
people who are experiencing intellectual
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
or developmental disabilities people
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
with acquired brain injuries people like
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
my dad who suffered from Alzheimer's and
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is very emotional for me
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
because my father who was the sweetest
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
person I mean we never I I'm older right
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
my friends they did something wrong they
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
get a little whack I got a lecture okay
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
I never he never raised a hand but when
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
he was in his 80s and his mind was
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
getting erased by this terrible disease
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
he became aggressive and sometimes like
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
would you know agitated and sometimes
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
even violent he wandered a lot and even
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
though he was older um he managed to
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
elude my mother um and sometimes would
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
just disappear when she was trying to do
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
something like you know run into the
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
library to you know give her you know
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
return a book or whatever and that would
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
be it you know he also had health
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
physical health issues um he had heart
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
disease and so I can just totally
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
Envision the time where I mean there
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
were times when she would call the
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
police or someone for help and if
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
someone approached my dad even when he
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
was in a care facility when he didn't
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
expect them um and they were trying to
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
help him it might be with something that
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
had to do with taking care of like
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
wiping off his face if there was
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
something on it anything he would reach
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
out grab them he bruised my mom who
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
tried to like help him to take some
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
medications at one point but this was
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
his disease right this isn't something
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you'd want to see him hauled into
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
court or to jail about and you know and
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that oh sure he'll get before a
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
magistrate or a judge within 24 to 36
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
hours would I mean the harm that would
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
be done for him being out of his
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
environment and what and for what
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
purpose when I think about what is the
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
purpose you know there there are various
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
purposes of our criminal law right one
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
is to punish people who do objectively
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
bad things right they cause physical
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
harm they do something you know breaks
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
our our civil code um it's also a
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
deterrent right I don't think that this
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation is going to prevent
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
these kinds of unintentional acts from
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
happening and sometimes there could be
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
harm involved so what this does is it
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
takes a misdemeanor where which you know
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
someone you know which includes
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
unprivileged physical conduct without
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
harm but also it could include the kind
 
00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:51.079 align:start position:0%
of injury that my father caused when he
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
would you know try to get someone away
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
from him and cause a bruise that would
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
be bodily injury
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
and it raises that to a felony it means
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
that someone in that position it's right
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
now if that happened right now
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
today that would be a misdemeanor
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
someone could go and get an arrest
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
warrant and have my dad arrested but in
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
the meantime he would be transported to
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and needs to get his care
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
and he'd get his care and then if if an
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant issued then that happened
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
and he'd have to deal with it it's not
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
like there's no consequences possible
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
but then all these issues around
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
competency could be raised bed um you
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
know I'm using my dad as an example but
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you can see it happening with someone
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
with a developmental disability a brain
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
injury someone who doesn't have the
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
executive functioning skills intact to
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
know what's going on now I appreciate I
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
have to say it was heartwarming to hear
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative PR's testimony about the
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate loss of a hair which is
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
terrible and I'm sure that really hurt a
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
lot and it was really heartwarming to
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
hear that he had the that he was kind
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
and understood where this was coming
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
from and made a decision that this was
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
not something to be prosecuted but but
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
we would have this on our books and not
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
everyone not every person who's a first
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
responder even though I said I love
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
First Responders but I don't know that
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
100% of them are as caring and would
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
take that kind of rational just Humane
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
approach to a situation that results in
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
some pain and an injury like loss of
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
hair or something else so for those
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
reasons I think this is really
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
problematic overly broad I think it's
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
not going to prevent injuries to our
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
First Responders there may be other ways
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
to prevent injuries to First Responders
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly what some of them
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
are I think that it's just it it is a
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
problem that we ought to study and try
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
to make more resources available to
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
those folks because they are trying to
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know they they they are like our
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
Angels right um but I feel that the the
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
consequences of of this are really dire
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons we would oppose
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation this bill as as drafted
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murphy thank
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I uh empathize with
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
your situation I too had a a parent with
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's who behaved much the way you
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
you do and I also have a son with a
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury who has minimal
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
executive functioning skills uh both of
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
which would concern me in this issue as
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
a healthc care provider a former nurse I
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
too recognize that we need to be able to
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
protect those people who are trying to
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
to try to help our our patients um I'm
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
not sure but I I believe that I was on
 
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for that um prior Bill
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
about health uh which addressed pretty
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
much the same situation but with a
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
different population so we were
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
healthare providers sp58 and there was a
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
St there was a work for um Healthcare
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce Coalition that DRC played a
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
role in also that that was what I was my
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
question was were you part of that and
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
did you have suggestions as to how we
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
might make this better so that we
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
achieve the protection that we need for
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
EMS but also protect the vulnerable
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
populations that that they may be that
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
they are facing every day right so my my
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
predecessor I've been in this role this
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
is my fourth legislative session my
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
predecessor Mike Skiby who was our
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
policy director before me was involved
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
in that um directly and then I was
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
involved um more recently in um sort of
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
honing the language that resulted in s
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
sp58 which ultimately passed so I would
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to work with
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
folks on trying to address this issue um
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
it did take some time as I understand it
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
what one of the things that the um
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Workforce safety commission
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
did was they also looked to collect data
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
on on this and I think that would really
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
important to understand um you know how
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
often this happens who are the folks
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
assaulting um our First Responders and
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
um what what training is there what are
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
what are the factors leading up to this
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
I think there's information that would
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
be really helpful to gain um if there
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
was some study further study done in
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
addition to looking at what you're
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
talking about representative Murray and
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
how it is that Murphy sorry how it is
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
that we could um carve out situations
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
where um we're not you know punishing
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
people whose behavior is really directly
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
related to having a disability but not
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
um allowing folks to you know like ought
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know who who have that men Rea who
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
have that purposeful intent and you know
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
to harm someone who's there to help them
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
um that that might be something to
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
really work on but I don't know that I
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's not an answer that I can just
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
quickly come up with um there are also
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
already there's in our criminal code as
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
I understand it there is um a specific
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
provision um that protects Corrections
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
Officers from assaults against well it
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't protect them it creates an
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
additional felony when prisoners um
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
assault and harm a corrections officer
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
so that does exist already I think I
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
pulled it out it's um six it's RSA 642
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
colon 9 so um and if they if someone is
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
a prisoner and they commit an assault um
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
as defined under 631 which is the um RSA
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
you're looking at amending now um it
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be considered a class B felony and
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
then the sentence would run concurrently
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
not concurrently what is it
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
consecutively sorry um with the sentence
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the person's already serving so
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are protections there and um I
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't help myself but representative
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
L there is LEL there is a statute ready
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
that um adds it to be that creates a um
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
crime it may also be a felony hold on
 
00:55:01.559 --> 00:55:02.990 align:start position:0%
crime it may also be a felony hold on
for

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
um for assaults against someone who's
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
like in the general
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
court or elected
 
00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
official no um yeah I G to find it for
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
you because I did oh here it is 631
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
colon 4-a harmer threats to certain
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
government officials so um that that
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
does create an additional um class a
 
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.789 align:start position:0%
does create an additional um class a
felony

00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:55:27.799 --> 00:55:29.029 align:start position:0%
felony
representative

00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
Shar thank you madam Pier
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
um what language would you recommend to
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
sort this out I I I like I said I don't
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
think I can come up with that off the
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
top of my head I'd really want to think
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
about it I think it's complicated um
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
because one thing I worry about is how
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
is someone who is an um like an EMS
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to know that the person they are
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
are being FL at by has one of these
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
conditions so I I just I I don't I don't
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
know the answer right now I think we can
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
think about I think put a put some
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
brains together we can come up with
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
something well me rep followup I do
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
believe that they are very much trained
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
on that as a matter of fact um certainly
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
to recognize to recognize those and if
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
they're with a family member that would
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
certainly be a tell when they when
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
they're letting you know that but follow
 
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:26.039 align:start position:0%
up yeah I and in that pain Madam chair U
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm aware you know uh the Portsmouth
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
Police Department gets a lot of training
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh the officers get a lot of training on
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
managing those who are in Mental Health
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
crisis uh we um and we we Avail
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
ourselves of the mobile crisis units um
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
but um you know what about language that
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
carves out of this statute a certain
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
population do you think that's a good
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
way to approach this or I'm just getting
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
your general thoughts
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
I mean it might be I'm also thinking
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
about like people who are deaf and heart
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
of hearing who might respond in a way
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's unexpected I mean I mean there
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
may be other kinds of disabilities
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps there I don't want to say no I
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to work on it there may
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
be a way to do this um but I think it
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
would require some thought and I do know
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
I am aware that there's a lot of
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
training um for police officers through
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
the police academy I don't know how much
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
training there is available for EMS
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
workers or EMTs if it's as robust and if
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
there's um you know what the the bread
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
of and depth of training is in terms of
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
trauma informed approaches and um
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
deescalation and those which is really
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
important when you're approaching
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
someone as well so that would be
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
something to consider uh last for
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have uh several um
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
firemen EMT and police officers on this
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
committee that could tell us that
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
whenever we uh go into our executive
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
session um just so everybody knows we
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
are coming up to um pretty much an hour
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
we still have three more people that
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
would like to testify so if we could
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we just really kind of answer
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
our answer the questions at hand um
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative Muse did you have a
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
question I thought I saw your hand up
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
you're all set okay all right are we
 
00:58:11.039 --> 00:58:12.789 align:start position:0%
you're all set okay all right are we
representative

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I have a
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
concern about the on the last page of
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
the bill on p on page one it talks about

the extended term of imprisonment under
 
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.230 align:start position:0%
the extended term of imprisonment under
uh

uh
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
6516 G1 to read as follows and then I
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't see I'm I'm having to um that that
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
that was I'm sorry that was a different
 
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
issue can I can I correct my question
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes I'll get to that um I won't I'll
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
figure that other one out later on um
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
there is a term in on the page one line
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
14 that talks about
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
597 uh a defendant is is
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous um under RSA and that's
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
that and and it it references paragraph
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
3 A1 and I don't know if you have
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
anything in your information when you
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
studied it and for the for the sponsors
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's just that I can't find it anywhere
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
and I've searched all over the computer
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
to just find this the citation that's
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
there so we may need help with that
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
later thank you madam chair so I have
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
never practiced criminal law okay um I
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
did look at this RSA and so I will tell
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
you what my quick understanding is but I
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that you speak with someone ask
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
this question of someone who has as I
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
understand it what this would do is
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
create a presumption of dangerousness
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
which is a factor that a court would
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
look into in terms of determining
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
whether to um allow the person to be
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
discharged on personal recognizance or
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
bail as opposed to having to wait at the
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
County Corrections Facility to have
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
before they have their
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
hearing but that's but like I said
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
qualify that thank you very much
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%

background in different demographics and
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
the different types of patients you can
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
encounter on a 9911 call would be an
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
understatement uh me personally I've
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
been assaulted and uh verbally
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
physically more times than I can count
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
in this career as well as my
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
co-workers um I personally two years ago
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
was assaulted to the point where I
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
required an ER evaluation after the call
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
I was kicked in the face in the chest
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
multiple times from a patient
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
that made an a an active decision to
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
drink that
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
evening and through that drinking was
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
angry that that particular patient had
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
to go to the hospital and while taking
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
that patient out of the ambulance I was
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
in a vulnerable position doing my job in
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
front of an officer I was kicked in the
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
face in the chest it was on camera that
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
patient fa a Mis meanor charge and was
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
let off with Rehabilitation of
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
rehab that should say
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
something that people that advocate for
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
mental health patients I'm now mental
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
health patient where's my
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy at what point does my life
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
matter for somebody to protect me all
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
everyone I invite you to come work with
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
us for shift I invite you to come see
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
the discretion that we have with every
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
individual patient that struggles I
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
invite you to come see how much training
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have to decipher whether the patient
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
has has a mental health crisis whether
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
they have a brain injury whether they
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
have dementia there's a lot of signs
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
there's an abundance of training that we
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
go through we are given a role in this
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
uniform that we are allowed to make
 
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
decisions we are licensed to a level
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
of standing protocols that we're
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
allowed because we're trusted with these
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
decisions we're trusted to save your
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
loved ones lives with medication and
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
decisions critically thinking and
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
chaos so to think that we don't deal
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
with discretion and take the time to
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of if the
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
patient's having a mental health crisis
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
versus intently making a decision with
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
intent to
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
injure is slightly no offense
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
disrespectful I take this job so
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
seriously most would say I put it before
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
myself more days than not in fact I'm
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
should be at work right now I'm missing
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
pay to be here because that's how
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
important this is to me when I found out
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
that this state didn't have a felony
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
charge for somebody that could kick me
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the face in the chest and not get
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
penalized for
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
it Choice words were made let's just say
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I think uh I can't speak for the
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill but I think the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
point is uh being missed here that we're
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
not just going to charge every single
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
person that raises a hand to us this
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill was meant and created with a
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
purpose to have protection and to uphold
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
a standard that will'll not be tolerated
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
that we will be assaulted because
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
someone got angry when you were taught
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
as a child that you had big emotions
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
were you penalized and punished for
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
hitting your your classmates your
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
siblings why is it okay to hit somebody
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
in uniform that's called to help you I
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
didn't sign on for a job that the years
 
01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this I say I can't tell
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
you how many new hires and probies oh
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
violence is just part of the job why is
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
that an acceptable thing why is why am I
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay with accepting that you wouldn't
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
accept it in your
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
relationships why is it okay for me to
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
accept it in a uniform because someone
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
called 911 and I responded the amount of
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
times I've been assaulted and never once
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
sought to seek charges on that person
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
whether it was because someone told me
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't go anywhere the person
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't show up for court that it was a
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
waste of time when this happened the
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
prosecutor called me and said yeah
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
nothing's really going to happen she's
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to go to rehab she admitted that
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
she has a problem with
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
drinking okay so in the future when I
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
get in trouble I can just say I have a
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
problem with drinking that gets me out
 
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.190 align:start position:0%
problem with drinking that gets me out
of

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
time the amount of training that we go
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
through the amount of extra effort we go
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
to in each call the amount of tact that
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
we have with each patient the amount of
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
times that I have called someone sir
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
after they've called me a derogatory
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
name please understand that we love your
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
loved ones we wouldn't if we didn't do
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
this job because we don't get paid I
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many people in
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
uniform have multiple jobs because we
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't make a wage that really supports
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
cost of living in these days and that's
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
a whole different issue but I'm just
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
saying most people that wear this uni
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
form it's because they have a passion
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
for it they have a passion for taking
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
the extra last night I stayed 25 minutes
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
past my shift because an elderly woman
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
with dementia who was anxious couldn't
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
find her glasses and she was vicious
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
gosh was she vicious her issue was she
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't find her blue eyeglasses and I
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave until I found the blue
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
eyeglasses was that my job no but did it
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
settle her for the night yes
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just trying to say I had this
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
whole thing written out I was going to
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
be so tactful and professional and I
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
realized I'm just going to be myself
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
I've been shot at in this career I've
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
been held captive in
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
apartments I have been spit at kicked
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
punched more times you know the person
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's having the Mental Health crisis
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
you take the extra time to still talk
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
calmly to them the person with a
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
disability you take the time to talk
 
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.630 align:start position:0%
disability you take the time to talk
quiet

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
quiet
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
to take time with them to get down low
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
on their level the person with an
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
elderly issue that's digging their nails
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
into your arm you ask nicely ma'am can
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
you please release my arm you don't dig
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
your nails back into her arm because
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
she's hurting you did I swing back on
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
the person that hit me no because I'm a
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
professional this bill wasn't put in
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
place so that we can just carelessly
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
throw felonies at people that raise
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
their arms or their feet it's with a
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
purpose and with intent you make a
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
decision every single day of your life
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
if you chose to get up today and go
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
drink from that drinking and what occurs
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
in that drinking was your choice if you
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
chose to get up in day to do to do drugs
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's your choice I understand people
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
in mental health issues I have my own
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
now from this
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
job I understand people that have
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injuries I have the
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for them that must be
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
really difficult to live like that every
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
day people with dementia it can happen
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
at a really young age you could be 45
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
years old with early dementia you can't
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
just assume because they're young that
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
dementia I ask you to be a little more
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
informed in what we do with uniform and
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
please at any point in time if any of
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
you would like to come do the job with
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
us for a few hours feel free I would
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
gladly take you
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
around this bill was just meant to
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
protect us in the situations like mine
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
where I took a boot a work boot to the
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
face in the
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
chest and nobody was held accountable
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Barry I just one quick
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
question where were the blue
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
glasses under the computer naturally
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
AC ad right chair committee members
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I appreciate
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
that this hearing has run over time so I
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
will try to fly through this um and if
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
you all have questions I appreciate that
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
but I also respect that you all have
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
more hearings so um I believe there are
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
of course very good intentions behind
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
supporting the concept of this bill but
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
I urge that you pause and not move
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
forward at this time I asked the
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
committee to pump the brakes on going
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
down the path of adding further enhanced
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
penalties based on Career or profession
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
especially when we already have extended
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
terms of imprisonment in our laws when a
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
victim is an emergency
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
responder if those aren't being used
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's a different
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
conversation we need to acknowledge that
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
if a statute is not working creating
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
additional statute language is not
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
really solving the things that are being
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
testified to
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
today um the opportunity to coorse
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
people with the threat of very long life
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
destroying sentences creates an
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
off-putting power Dynamic that can lead
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
to abuse I think that's really important
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
when we've seen these bills in other
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
states it's important to highlight again
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ER carves out enhan
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
penalties for the exact emergency
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
responders listed listed in HB 59 but in
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
a different way if you want a special
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
place in our laws for emergency
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
responders we have that we do
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and value that they go into
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
very dangerous places and deal with very
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
intense situations on a routine
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
basis however going much further than
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
what we already have in statute and
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
adding specific careers directly into
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
the assault statute itself is all deeply
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
concerning HB 59 is changing a lot about
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
our criminal law statutes changing the
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
level of offenses changing the person's
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
rights pre-trial changing the years of
 
01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:25.870 align:start position:0%
rights pre-trial changing the years of
incarceration

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
and changing the standard and harm
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
required for these new
 
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
felonies for example second degree
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
assault a felony facing up to seven
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
years in prison would be changed to just
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
any bodily injury that would include a
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
scratch while the folks who testify
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
today I understand would not potentially
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
seek charges there the criminal legal
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
system is very complex and individual
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
situations get very heightened very
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
quickly and we do not need these really
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming types of charges lingering
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
over people's
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
heads it even has only unprivileged
 
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
heads it even has only unprivileged
physical

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
contact that's no injury required for a
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
felony assault where you could get up to
 
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.510 align:start position:0%
felony assault where you could get up to
seven

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
years something I'll discuss later is
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
the importance of when it comes to plea
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining what actually happens when
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're facing these types of really
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
intense prison sentences folks are not
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
going to trial that rarely happens
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
except for in Law and Order we're
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
talking about negotiations and the power
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
dynamics that come into
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
play currently in New Hampshire if
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
someone knowingly recklessly or
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
purposely assaults a police officer or
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
other emergency responders it is already
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
a felony that with enhanced penalties
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
may receive 10 to 30 years in prison if
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
someone commits simple assault a
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor against a police officer it
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
may be enhanced to F two to 5 years in
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
sentences even without enhancements I
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
want to flag that our assault statutes
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
are severe in and of itself for any
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
person something that I think should
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
really be considered more than maybe
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
some of my other points is that this is
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
not a deterrent and I believe that a lot
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
of times when we are passing criminal
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
laws we Aspire for them to be
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
deterrence and that in this case
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
especially does not work people who are
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
responding to emergency situations are
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
often dealing with as discussed here
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
people who are in their worst moments
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
their worst marital moment possibly
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
having a mer uh a mental health crisis
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
under the influence dealing with medical
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
issues conditions disabilities
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
PTSD there's a heightened stress anxiety
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and panic in this situation despite best
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
efforts no one is going to remember if
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
they ever knew the difference in prison
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
they may not even understand fully
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
what's happening where they are they're
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
panicking maybe not even thinking what
 
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing is assault deterrent is
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
not happening in this specific case
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
someone who's willing to knowingly and
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
truly assault an officer or an EMT is
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
not going to stop and calmly think
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
through the sentencing guidelines
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
either we do not want everyone in these
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
heightened States or under these
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances criminalized to such a
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:31.550 align:start position:0%
circumstances criminalized to such a
severe

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
degree we need to fully consider will
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
this be a tool to force plea bargaining
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
or other problematic outcomes with many
 
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.629 align:start position:0%
or other problematic outcomes with many
vulnerable

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
defendants we are talking about
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
automatic felonies for a host of wildly
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
different types of community members
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
with different reasons for their
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
actions we are also talking about a
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
situation where police or EMT are now
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
walking away with potential ually no
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
injuries or a minor scratch and the
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
other person is now facing years in
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
prisons and the dynamic that that then
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
creates I ask the committee to take time
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
to discuss whether this will be a
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
deterrent or if it may be more along the
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
lines of seeking increased retribution
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
with very long and expensive prison
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
sentences though I very much appreciate
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the good intentions here we have real
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
concerns of police overusing the charge
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
especially in cases where they fear the
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
person will claim police brutality we
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
have seen this in other states with
 
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.390 align:start position:0%
have seen this in other states with
similar

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
laws assaulting police and emergency
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
responders is of course never okay no
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
one here disagrees with that but that
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
does not mean that we need to push
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly long incredibly long prison
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
sentences where the laws are already in
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
place for both the police and
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutors to handle if someone
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
assaults one of their own if they're not
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
handling that that's a different
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
conversation f colonization in this
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
manner increases the chances that people
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
will be forced into plea bargaining with
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the threat of felony
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
charges also lastly I would just like to
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
add who gets added next to our assault
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
statutes as we have seen in many other
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
states once a criminal statutes are
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
expand expanded to include specific
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
occupations or professions the push will
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
continue to add more professions I've
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
seen bills for bouncers there there's a
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
host this is a large thing I think we
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
should pause and discuss um I don't
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
think we want to go down this path of
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
ranking different professionals to a
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
higher class directly in our criminal
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
laws in some there's good reason to
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
reconsider HB 59 mass incarceration has
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
been and continues to be fueled by ever
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
increasing long sentences longer
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentences have not been shown to be a
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
significant deterrent and people
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated will only consider to get
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
older and older in our prison system
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
with long
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
sentences if the goal is to support
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
emergency responders let's use tax
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
resources that would be wasted on
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
further prison sentences on increasing
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
emergency response times more robust
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
rural ambulance services and other much
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
needed supports in our community thank
 
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
you for your time I know it's been a
 
01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.790 align:start position:0%
you for your time I know it's been a
long

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
long

good morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Elizabeth Sergeant
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
I work for she Infinity Capital group
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
here in conquered and I'm here today
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police I'm just
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to make a couple of statements I
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
know it's been a long hearing um we are
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill um and I um just
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
want to say knowingly or recklessly
 
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
causes serious bodily injury we think
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
this is a serious bill um and I will
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
apologize to Holly she did reach out to
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
me absolutely we are monitoring every
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill in your committee so every night
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
the night before we're working through
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the next day so we are more than happy
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
to sit down with um the stakeholders in
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
this room um I've spoken to the sponsor
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work in a subcommittee um
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
to flesh out some of the issues that
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
were raised um and the only other thing
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
I did want to say we did look at Senate
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 78 we think that is a specific
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
Health Care setting so we think that is
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
not the same as this bill um and I guess
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say in representing law
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement these last few years I think
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
they do take the totality of the
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances into consideration and I
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
think they're very much aware of um the
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
um public that they are protecting and I
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
think that they um try to do their very
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
best and I uh may not be able to answer
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
any technical questions um but I be
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
happy to uh send those questions back to
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
my client I'm not sure why she pointed
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
at me thank you thank you very much Miss
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
Sergeant I don't see any questions I
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
would um just like to point out that
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
conversation uh amendments change this
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
change that if uh the sponsors are
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
interested in doing that I would
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to reach out to the the
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
people that um showed interest in
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
wanting to do that just because of the
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
large number of bills that the the
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee has that would probably be the
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
best way to make that happen so thank
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
you very much so much any questions okay
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
nobody else is there anybody else
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify on House Bill 59 that
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
is not turned in a paint card seeing
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
none I will close the public hearing um
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
I I hate to go right into the next
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
hearing guys but we are about about 20
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
minutes so we're going to go ahead and
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
do that if you just need to excuse
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
yourself I think that would be the best
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
way to go about that
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I will open the public hearing for
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 109 and invite the prime
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor to
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
introduce his
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you again Madame chair
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
members of Criminal Justice and Public
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
Safety representative Dennis Manion
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 25 I represent
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
Salem hopefully this bill is a little
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
easier um this is this is the second
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that chairman Roy filed
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
last year like I said I separated them
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
into two bills so what this bill does is
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
add to the false reports to law
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer statute two
 
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:05.639 align:start position:0%
sections one that would make it a
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if somebody
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
knowingly reports to a law enforcement
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
officer or agency that an officer um has
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
engaged in
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
misconduct if if they know that's false
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
so it's knowingly representing a false
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
statement of misconduct and the second
 
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.350 align:start position:0%
statement of misconduct and the second
part

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
is in creases it to an a Mis meanor if
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
they knowingly report uh to an agency by
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
word action false or baseless
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
information regarding allegations of
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
criminal conduct so last year this Bill
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
had class A MISD demen for both I didn't
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
think that was appropriate for the
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct part of it um but only for
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Criminal part of it and I'll explain
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
I think it seems pretty obvious but I'll
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
explain if somebody you arrest someone
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
and they want to retaliate against you
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
so they come to the station and say he
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
was rude to me he called me uh Rachel
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
slurs he swore at me he violated this
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
policy that's misconduct the penalty for
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
that could be some rep you know op
 
01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
determination from his jaob but it's not
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to be anything where he's going to
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
be uh charged criminally so that's why I
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
changed it uh the Criminal part of it
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
the class they miss me it so um this has
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
to be knowingly it's pretty high
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
standard if your intention is to go to
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
the station or report that this officer
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
did something he clearly did not do
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
solely for the purpose of uh retribution
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
against this officer or if you want to
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
accuse him of committing type type of a
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
crime and you know that it's false but
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
you're doing it for some type of
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
Retribution then the second part of this
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
would uh would be affected by it so
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
those are the two sections of the uh
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and I can take any
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
them representative Newman
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
chair could you just this is this is
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
more of a process question if you if
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
this were to become law and and uh Roman
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
number number three would would
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
happens what is the process somebody
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
comes in and and does this then what
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
what would happen how would this be what
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
would you do if that happened to you and
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
it would it involved that paragraph So
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
if somebody came in and made a um
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
a false allegation that you committed a
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
crime um and we're we're assuming at
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
this point it's on duty I've arrested
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
somebody and they've claimed that I've
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
committed the crime uh more likely than
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
that would be on body camera there's a
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
lot of cameras around today but let's
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
say it wasn't that would be investigated
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
by Internal Affairs if they don't have
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
internal affairs they have a a detective
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
or a sergeant that would investigate it
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
or possibly another agency that would
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
investigate it um and if during that
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
investigation they found out that this
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
didn't occur and that the person
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
they can prove that the person just
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
falsely made these claims at that point
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
an investigation would be done against
 
01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
the other person for making these false
 
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
PL under this statute if this would have
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
passed but the first plot of it would be
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
making you know investigating the
 
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.390 align:start position:0%
making you know investigating the
allegation

01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
allegation
 
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
allegation
first

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
followup followup
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to with throw my question
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you you good I'm good okay
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
um in this state we have an unfortunate
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh problem we read about almost every
 
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
week um there are police officers who
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
are charged with misconduct um we have a
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
lorry list uh that actually lists a
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of them so it does happen I guess
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
is I guess I I'll just ask you I mean do
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
you think that having a bill like this
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
would actually discourage people people
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
um who've experienced real misconduct
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
from reporting that
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct I don't think so like I said
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
knowingly is a high standard to reach um
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
and certainly someone's not going to be
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
charged and convicted of knowingly just
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't prove the opposite
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
so let's say that he made a claim
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
against somebody and we couldn't prove
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
the claim true doesn't mean they filed
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
it intentionally or knowingly and it was
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
a baseless claim I mean we have charges
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
or or allegations that are unfounded
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's not going to trigger an
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
automatic uh charge so we we would we
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
would have to prove that the person did
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
it it was ba it was baseless information
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
it was false and they knew that when
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
they made the
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
allegation that's a high
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Shear um you said
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
something that that kind of troubles me
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
if somebody came into the station and
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
said officer sure was rude to
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
me uh and we're about to get body cams
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth so they could go look at
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
the body Cam and see whether that was
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
true before they started a IIA
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
investigation Internal
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
Affairs I'm really troubled by the fact
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
that the the police department could
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
then turn around and charge someone with
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor just for saying he was
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
rude when you
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
know the definition of what counts as
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
rude really uh is Broad so I'm worried
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the scope of how you
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
describe what kind of reports this
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
covered so in the case of somebody
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
claiming that the officer was rude
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's all based on that person's
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
opinion so if then knowingly coming in
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
and saying the person was rude to me and
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
they found out that well we don't think
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
it rises to the to that level as far as
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
us taking action against the officer
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
discipline or whatnot that's not going
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
to trigger well you said he was rude and
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
he we don't think he was so you're going
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
to get charged that's subjective I mean
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
rudeness so I guess would more apply to
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
I mean he used a racial slur I mean
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
Roode is kind of a like I said that's
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
objective I don't think it's ever going
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
to come up um that's not what this this
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
this is for so misconduct would would
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
would I mean it's it's pretty clear
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
anything other than that would be
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
covered I mean rudess is something that
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
our our opinion of rude is is our
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
opinion of rude doesn't mean you filed
 
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.629 align:start position:0%
opinion of rude doesn't mean you filed
it

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and that you're going to get
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
charged with it because your opinion of
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
rude is that and that you know that that
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
officer uh if they determined he wasn't
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
rude doesn't mean it's going to trigger
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
trigger this so I understand what you're
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
saying but I don't think it's enough to
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
so I know the way that um a lot of times
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
police get get leads and cases uh from
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
people who you know who might call in
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
anonymously and with bone number
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
tracking systems and things like that
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit harder to do these
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
days but in in a case where somebody's
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
calling in and
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
Reporting uh some type of misconduct and
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
the department isn't able to the
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
department isn't actually able to verify
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
that or just dismisses it outright um
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
are are you concerned that that people
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
won't be reaching out to you in in cases
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
like that who really should
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
be no not at all again it's the same
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
answer I gave you last time with
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
knowingly is a high burden um
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
Anonymous uh reports are Anonymous and
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
if we can't identify the person then
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
there really no issue with it um this
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
would this is geared towards somebody
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
who is intentionally their their purpose
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
is to make a false claim a false
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
allegation against a law enforcement
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
officer in
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
retaliation and that's their purpose and
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's not someone who's making a claim
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
that turns out to be unfounded or not
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
true that's a different scenario the
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
high thank
 
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.600 align:start position:0%

01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 109 that has not
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
card if you could just make sure you uh
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
record good morning ladies and gentlemen
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh hearing me
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
for a moment I'll be uh what I hope will
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
be mercifully brief my name is Brendan
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
Davey I'm a major within New Hampshire
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
State Police I'm the commander of our
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
operations Bureau and I've been a
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement officer for uh
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
approaching 24 years years now uh I can
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
say having been a sergeant and a su uh
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
supervisor of shifts and then uh
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant as a a unit commander and a
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
field area Captain prior to my my
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
current role that um at the same time
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
that we do and we should take very
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
seriously every allegation and
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
misconduct um leveled against any sworn
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
peace officer in the state of New
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that it is um and can be a
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern that some of those
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
allegations are uh
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
significant and at the same time
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
materially false I would only submit uh
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
for the sake of the sponsor of the bill
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
um and for your consideration as well
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
that misconduct within the state of New
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in terms of uh law enforcement
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
10519 uh and that statute specifically
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
sites I want to say six or seven
 
01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.149 align:start position:0%
sites I want to say six or seven
particular

01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
offenses um with specificity that count
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
as misconduct and perhaps uh if this
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
statute were to point specifically to
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
that one and say it's it's not a matter
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
of rudeness it's not a matter of I felt
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
that he was
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed um or or she you know I
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
didn't like the way that she handled me
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
on this car stop which are matters of
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
professionalism and should still be
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
investigated and should still be dealt
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
with because we do need to be
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
professional whereas what we're talking
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
about is a violation of a law um that
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
would certainly help to clarify things
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
and take a lot of that subjectivity out
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
of it so that that's all I have for you
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time thank you very
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
much major I
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't representative Shear um I don't
 
01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
know if you're familiar the statute
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
unsworn falsification statute yes sir um
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
how does this overlap with
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
that um in that many of the allegations
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
that are are leveled in the cases that
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
would I think fall into consideration
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
were this statute to be uh to be enacted
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh the statements are not sworn at the
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
time that they're given and so unsworn
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
falsification wouldn't be invoked
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily um follow up followup I'm
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I maybe I'm I'm confus the the
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
statute I'm referring to I don't have
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
the number in front of me but there's a
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
says put unsworn falsification that is
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
the statement isn't sworn to when it's
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
given but it's a falsification there's
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
already a statute that deals with that
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
this uh this overlaps that substantially
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what the need for this
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
is um in in given the unsworn
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
falsification stat yes sir uh fair
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
question and i' I'd actually lead that
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the sponsor or
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
sir that would probably be something we
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be able to discuss at the
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
executive session if we wanted to it it
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
could also be noted that some
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
allegations are are uh so significant as
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
to constitute allegations of criminal
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
conduct on the part of law enforcement
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a statute that covers that
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
as well false reports of to law
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement thank thank you very much
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.310 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:32:29.709 --> 01:32:29.719 align:start position:0%
right is there anybody else here wishing
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
to testify on House Bill 109 that is not
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%

have scheduled for 12:00 if there is
 
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
anybody here today that wishes to

02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair and the committee
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here to just introduce Bill 146 as
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is unable to make it
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand it it is a bill
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
designed to keep video
 
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
evidence longer for
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
violations where it is not kept very
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
long for just a violation
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
that's all I know and no I am not taking
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative proof
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you madam chair members of
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Dennis
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
Manion Rock 25
 
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
Salem uh I oppose this uh
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill um for the simple reason that this
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
is already being done so
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
violations where there are charges
 
02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
clearly being uh made are already kept
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
for a minimum of three years um anything
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
that has a court case
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
pending um we're required to keep the
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
keep these uh body cameras for a minimum
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
of three
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
years um what we do is in the system I
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
work with axon and I work with watch God
 
02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
in the past we set up retention rules in
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
advance so for an arrest we would have
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
minimum of years for a call for service
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
we're allowed no sooner than 30 days no
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
later than 180 days we usually set those
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
for 180 so there's certain uh time
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
frames that we have preset in the system
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
so anytime there's a there's an arrest
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
or a charge it's automatically preserved
 
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
for three years um at a
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
minimum so the retention rule we have a
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
separate one for traffic warnings and
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
traffic citation so if you're get if
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're issued a traffic citation in New
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire technically that's no
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
different than an arrest you can be
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
arrested for a violation no Hampshire
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
but in Li of that they issue a what's
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
called a padded summons and you have a
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
an option of ping by mail or a
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
requesting a court date so in either
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
event though once that video comes in
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is tagged as uh arrest and that's
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
saved for a minimum of three years so
 
02:04:11.709 --> 02:04:11.719 align:start position:0%
there's really no need for this the
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
other part of this is the request of the
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
camera recording within five
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
days this should be handled as Discovery
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
Quest and and taken care of through that
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
process uh we shouldn't be setting a
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
different day for 91a requests a
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
different day for body camera request
 
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
for violations and then a different day
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
for Discovery this is strictly
 
02:04:34.990 --> 02:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
evidentiary for the persons who use in
 
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
court it's it should go through this
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
discovery process uh and the last part
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
of it really raises my eyebrows of
 
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
violation being dismissed if that's not
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
received within five days sounds a
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
little bit like somebody may have had a
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
run in and and looking to get their
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
charges dropped so I don't I don't
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose of that but for
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um I oppose this
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative I don't see any questions
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
looks like you got off scotf free look
 
02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.589 --> 02:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
and injuri good afternoon my name is
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
Stephen ERS I'm an assistant County
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney at the marac county attorney's
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
office I've been a prosecutor for over
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
20 years I also uh oppose House Bill 146
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly understand that RSA 105 D2
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
which is the body warn camera statute
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
has a couple of shortcomings and some
 
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in it especially when it comes
 
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
to providing Discovery in in criminal
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
cases those issues are hopefully being
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
addressed by another Senate Bill there
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
was a bill last year that went to a
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
study committee at the uh law
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement accreditation commission at
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
police St and training who wrote a
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
report making some recommendations as a
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
result of those recommendations there's
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
a Senate Bill pending that would look at
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
all cases not just violation level cases
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
and not just cases under RSA 265 which
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
is the motor vehicle code so this bill
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
itself only applies to violations under
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
265 meaning if you got a speeding ticket
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
you'd be entitled to receive the body
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
warant camera within 5 days but if for
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
example you got charged with Class B
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor driving well intoxicated you
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
would then go back to the normal sort of
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
Discovery rules which wouldn't have that
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
time frame associated with it so it
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a ton of sense to me
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
personally that you get it within 5 days
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
for a speeding ticket but a more serious
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
crime you wouldn't necessarily get it
 
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
within 5 days I think this also raises
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
questions about multiple
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
charges uh you can certainly have a case
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
that perhaps started as a a speeding
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
ticket or something under 265 which
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
would be a violation and turned into
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
something else for example if the police
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
officer ended up finding drugs in the
 
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh it could be a much larger
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
stop and then I Echo the the sentiments
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
about the the penalty provision that
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
failure of law enforcement to disclose
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
the recording as required by this
 
02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
subsection results in the case being
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed without pre with prejudice I'm
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
sorry uh my concern is that of course in
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire body War cameras aren't
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory and I it seems like at least
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
from the introduction when I was here a
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago representative Sher had
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
asked essentially how do we encourage
 
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
police departments to use bodyw warn
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
cameras and to me if you're a police
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
department a police chief and you're
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not I should equip
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
my my officers with body Waring cameras
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
and you're told that if you do equip
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
them with body War cameras you're then
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
under this obligation to to hand the
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
body wearing camera recording out within
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
5 days and if you don't do that your
 
02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
case is going to be dismissed with
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
prejudice it seems to me that that does
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily incentivize law
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement to uh adopt body warant
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
cameras in general so for a number of
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
reasons I am opposed to this bill and
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sher Again full
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh Mr Enders had the
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
missfortune of also being a student of
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
mine um what's the name of the the
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
number of the uh bill in the Senate
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's being worked on it's Senate Bill
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
289 thank
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
lels thank you for taking my question
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not this is not necessarily specific
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
to the bill but if if a police
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
department um provides body War cameras
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
to their Law Enforcement
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
Officers um
 
02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
I think that that uh video can can work
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of different ways it can Pro
 
02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
protect the officer or it can protect
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
the person that uh uh that's being
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
charged is is there
 
02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
charged is is there
any

02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
statute that disallows a police officer
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
from turning off the camera
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
Cera yes there is yes so RSA 105
 
02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
D2 is the state sort of compre I I think
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's a very comprehensive statute
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
regarding body War cameras it requires
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
the police to activate them upon arrival
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
or as soon as practicable it requires
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
the police to inform the person that
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're being recorded it requires that
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
essentially once the recording is
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
activated that it be maintained
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire incident um it
 
02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.030 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire incident um it
allows

02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
the recording to be muted under certain
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances for example when officers
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
are speaking to each other whether
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're sort of forming a plan or that
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
type of thing they're allowed to mute it
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a fairly comprehensive
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
statute already in New Hampshire
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
regarding body warn cameras that that
 
02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
statute has a couple of sections that
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
that first section is the the creation
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
of the body Waring camera in the field
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then the second sections of 105 D2
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
deal with how that recording is
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
maintained once it's made and there's
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions in that statute on copying
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
displaying viewing that body warn camera
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
which the legislature put in place
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
because they were concerned about
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
privacy of individuals on body warn
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
cameras and then the last section of
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
that statute talks about retention of
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
the body warrant cameras and in a little
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
bit of a sort of an odd twist normally
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
retention statutes say you have to keep
 
02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
it for at least this amount of time RSA
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
105 D2 says You Must Destroy it within
 
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
certain time frames so again I think
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's a result of wanting to protect
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
people's privacy and not have these
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
things hanging around forever there are
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
situations as the gentleman before me
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
indicated that if charges are brought

records yeah yeah a lot of people you
 
03:30:40.110 --> 03:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
can mess with in this but not
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:49.950 --> 03:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just there you go
 
03:30:49.960 --> 03:30:52.150 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just there you go
thank

03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
you there you go the red red means go in
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
this committee I got it um so this bill
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
is very simple um and it is
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
just it is uh intended to address uh
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
largely a safety issue but to some
 
03:31:10.269 --> 03:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
degree an accountability issue um there
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
have been news headlines over the years
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
in various uh districts I don't uh
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any in New Hampshire but
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
I've certainly seen them in other states
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
where uh people commit home invasions or
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
commit other acts they um pull someone
 
03:31:23.309 --> 03:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
over for speeding which becomes a
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
pretext for a carjacking or something um
 
03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
by posing as a police officer um and
 
03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
people can do this uh just because uh
 
03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are not requirements for
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
identification or um police are not
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
restricted from exercising their police
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
powers only when they're in uniform so
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
this is a simple modification um that
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
says that when a officer is in uniform
 
03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
everything is same as it is now when an
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
officer is out of uniform um and he's
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
undercover and it's pre-approved
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
everything is the same as now so you
 
03:31:55.389 --> 03:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
know I say you know uh let's deal some
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
drugs you're not a cop are you the cop
 
03:31:59.830 --> 03:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
says no of course not uh and that's fine
 
03:32:02.550 --> 03:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
and um in exing circumstances there are
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
no need to hold up your ID before you're
 
03:32:06.429 --> 03:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
kicking in a door or something uh
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
however if someone says hey you know I'm
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
a cop and this person is dressed in a
 
03:32:12.030 --> 03:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
T-shirt and uh you know I need to see
 
03:32:13.469 --> 03:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
your ID I need your social security
 
03:32:16.110 --> 03:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
number uh you can legitimately say hey
 
03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
are you actually a cop can I see your ID
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
and um that is the only requirement and
 
03:32:23.189 --> 03:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
so this should not be a problem for any
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
legitimate um law enforcement officer um
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there should be uh the finance
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee has said that there should be
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
no budget impact and I'm open to any
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um so when you said
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
about social security number that was
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
just an example right I don't it was an
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
example of something I saw um in a uh
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
YouTube channel the civil rights lawyer
 
03:32:47.469 --> 03:32:47.479 align:start position:0%

03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:18.309 align:start position:0%
and the person says no if the police
officer

03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
then um uh says well I'm I'm going to
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
hold you here until you answer some
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
questions at at that point under the law
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
the officer the the the individual is
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
detained I agree and the exercise of
 
03:35:32.399 --> 03:35:33.269 align:start position:0%
detained I agree and the exercise of
that

03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
Authority uh to detain the person
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
briefly which they're allowed to do
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
under certain
 
03:35:41.790 --> 03:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh I'm just
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
not still not sure what we get with 28b
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
sure um so I I think I'm I'm not a
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I think that might be a Terry
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
stop that we're both talking about um
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I am a
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
la I I passed the bar exam by deciding
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
not to go to law school um so the you
 
03:36:03.269 --> 03:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
know there is the whole thing about am I
 
03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
being detained and the officer you know
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer that um Etc and so uh
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is um triggered this bill is
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
triggered in part by an incident that
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
happened uh to a friend of mine uh
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
Jeremy calman who was at his home and
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
two people came up to his front door uh
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
Dressed in civilian clothing and said we
 
03:36:22.389 --> 03:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
are FBI agents and we have some
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
questions and um I think that Jeremy
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
asked them for identification and they
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
Shrugged it off um I and four other
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
three other Representatives wrote To The
 
03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
Head of the FBI division uh
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
headquartered in Boston which covers New
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh said hey we are state
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
representatives a constituent of one of
 
03:36:43.710 --> 03:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
ours an acquaintance of the rest uh had
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
this incident where two people not in
 
03:36:47.790 --> 03:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
uniform without an identification who
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
did not give their names who did not
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
give their badge numbers claimed to be
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
FBI agents can you tell us if these
 
03:36:55.870 --> 03:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
people were FBI agents and further can
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
you tell us what your Protocols are I
 
03:36:58.830 --> 03:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
mean you know maybe your Protocols are
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
explicitly there's three tiers there's
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
undercover there's you know FBI inform
 
03:37:04.870 --> 03:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
whatever um can you tell us if these
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
people were FBI agents and what your
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
Protocols are for displaying information
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh or identification when requested and
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
we got no response uh we escalated a few
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
times and asked again and we got no
 
03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:16.189 align:start position:0%
times and asked again and we got no
response

03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:37:16.199 --> 03:37:17.710 align:start position:0%
response
um

03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a thing where in this
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular case uh this individual was
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
not detained he was on his front step
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
but um nonetheless there was a situation
 
03:37:28.750 --> 03:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
and I suggest that with a law like this
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
in place uh there would be no
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
interference with investigative
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
abilities if if these were real FBI
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
agents they could have said yes of
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
course we are here are our badges uh
 
03:37:40.189 --> 03:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
this would have been useful for Jeremy
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
in this case you know he could have
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
taken a quick picture uh so that if he
 
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
had a civil rights lawsuit or anything
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
later he would know what was happening
 
03:37:48.189 --> 03:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
so you know we can also talk about the
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
scenario you know we've talked about the
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
one scenario where it's criminals posing
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement agents we can talk
 
03:37:55.349 --> 03:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
about another uh scenario where they are
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
legitimate law enforcement agents either
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
conducting a mission that was not
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
authorized by their superiors or
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
exceeding the scope uh knowledgeable in
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that if the complaint comes in
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
later there were two bearded gentlemen
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
in their 30s wearing clothes you know
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's the identification um and you
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
know in this case Jeremy did have video
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that provided extra detail but in
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
many cases people aren't running their
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
cameras and especially it's fairly
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
common for law enforcement officers with
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
or without legal authority to tell
 
03:38:23.950 --> 03:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
citizens stop filming so you can imagine
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
a scenario where someone is you know
 
03:38:28.189 --> 03:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
pulled over or accosted at the street or
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
they're in Costco and someone claims to
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
be you know uh uh immigration control or
 
03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
FBI or whatever wants to have a quick
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
conversation the you know maybe a person
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know and I've unfortunately been on
 
03:38:40.590 --> 03:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
the receiving end of this you know I
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
know what my rights are I know a Terry
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
stop I you know can ask if I'm being
 
03:38:45.510 --> 03:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
detained or not I can ask if that's a
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
lawful command or just a request I can
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
ask if I'm free to go uh but most
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
Americans are not fully cognizant of
 
03:38:51.199 --> 03:38:51.950 align:start position:0%
Americans are not fully cognizant of
their

03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
rights um but you know if you you know
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
see TV uh real citizens know that they
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
do have to be read their rights this is
 
03:39:01.550 --> 03:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly simple thing to ask and
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
similarly uh in New Hampshire you know
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
can I see your ID is a very simple thing
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
and at that point you know maybe the
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
actual Law Enforcement Officers showed
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
their ID but become cognizant of hey he
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
knows my name now I'd better play it by
 
03:39:18.269 --> 03:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
the book and follow regulations um or
 
03:39:20.990 --> 03:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
say uhoh you know this is I I've gotten
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
out over my skis I'm doing something I
 
03:39:25.229 --> 03:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and they turn and walk away um
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
and even in that latter case uh that
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
would be under this a crime to say I'm a
 
03:39:32.110 --> 03:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer I'm you know
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
giving you a command or you know I want
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation but then
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
scurrying away so this would uh Bill if
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
passed would serve as a deterrent to uh
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
that sort of behavior which does in fact
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
happen follow up
 
03:39:48.429 --> 03:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
I'm a law enforcement
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
officer I and I give you a command I'm
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a fake law enforcement officer thank
 
03:39:57.790 --> 03:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
God for everybody um and I give you a
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
command uh to do
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
something to me that's covered by
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
10428a I'm a person who falsely is ex
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
knowingly or and falsely exercises the
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
functions of a police officer I I agree
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
with you so so my hypothetical where I
 
03:40:18.670 --> 03:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh included the statement gives a
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
command um muddied my hypothetical and
 
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
brought it into something that is in
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
fact covered by a so I again want to you
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
know talk about situations where there
 
03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
is not an explicit command but merely
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
someone claims to be and uses that as
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
sort of implicit pretext and there's a
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
lot of case law um where you know judges
 
03:40:40.030 --> 03:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
at a great remov and with their sort of
 
03:40:42.030 --> 03:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic privilege can say well you
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
know anyone who's you know sat through
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
torts or Criminal or whatever would
 
03:40:47.469 --> 03:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
realize that the correct thing to say at
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
this juncture is such and such and the
 
03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
citizen did not walk away from the
 
03:40:52.189 --> 03:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
police officers therefore the citizen
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
was indicating that he was fully
 
03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
voluntarily engaged in a mutually
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
agreeable activity um I I I think that
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
those hypotheticals miss a lot of the
 
03:41:02.189 --> 03:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
sort of emotions and subjective
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
experience that happen uh with facts on
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
the ground and you know normal people uh
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
engaged in interactions with people who
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
either are or who claim to be Law
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers um so uh if if I
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
can adjust the hypothetical to you know
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
remove the command and just you know hey
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm from Ice uh I want to
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
you know not not a command but I want to
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
see this can you tell me where you were
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
born etc etc um you know is a thing that
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
does in fact happen both with legitimate
 
03:41:31.349 --> 03:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
Leos and
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:40.349 --> 03:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
you everybody good all right seeing no
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.399 --> 03:42:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:42:03.189 --> 03:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen I
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time my name is Brendan
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
Davey I'm a major with the New Hampshire
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
State Police I am the commander of our
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
operations Bureau I'm here representing
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
03:42:21.790 --> 03:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
in objecting to uh this bill as written
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
um line of questioning has has already
 
03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
um line of questioning has has already
uh

03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:29.910 --> 03:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
revealed uh to some extent that uh the
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
law if uh if enacted that this law would
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
be largely obviated by existing law
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um there are also issues of
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
exigency not addressed by this law in
 
03:42:48.149 --> 03:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
that um the exercise of police power is
 
03:42:51.870 --> 03:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
um in many cases bereft of opportunities
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
to uh exchange identification things of
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
that nature particularly when to do so
 
03:42:59.710 --> 03:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
is to expose the officer who may be off
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
duty in an official uh capacity at the
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
time that that these interactions could
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
occur and um furthermore there are
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
situations in which we use our
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
Undercovers uh to track uh to tail as it
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
were uh and to confront in some cases
 
03:43:19.389 --> 03:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
very dangerous people who at the site of
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
uniform police officers would behave in
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
manners that would subject themselves
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the officers and others to
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
unjustifiable risk
 
03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
um the the notion that a police officer
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
would approach someone and ask them for
 
03:43:38.910 --> 03:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
their social security number I I find
 
03:43:43.229 --> 03:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
um very very unlikely uh in this state
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
in particular and I would add to that
 
03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
in particular and I would add to that
that

03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
um two things that that were addressed
 
03:43:51.279 --> 03:43:53.389 align:start position:0%
um two things that that were addressed
the

03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh the profession of law enforcement as
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
a profession largely controls uh the
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
behavior of its members with standard
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
operating procedures many of which uh
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
are akin to the one that we have in the
 
03:44:07.149 --> 03:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police which
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
includes when asked for our name our
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
badge number as it were then we're to
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the idea that uh filming would be
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
that a person would be told to stop
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
filming um it that's a a very well
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
settled matter of law uh within this
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
state I'm a Public Employee you can film
 
03:44:34.110 --> 03:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
me as long as you like provided that it
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh subject us uh to unnecessary
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
risk basically or get in the way of the
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
lawful activity so um that is my those
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
are are uh my responses to uh to matter
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
spoken and the and the Department's view
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
Newman I just have a comment about the
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
I'm comparing this
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill to the current law and the the
 
03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
current law talks about any person in
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then says they they do this and and
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
displays a uniform without
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
Authority this bill says any person
 
03:45:29.070 --> 03:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
while not wearing their official uniform
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
see so it to me I think that narrows it
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
down just to someone who has a uniform
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
or has an identification just the
 
03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
wording of
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
it I'm wondering if that would just
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
narrow this down from any person that
 
03:45:46.469 --> 03:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
wording might narrow it down just to
 
03:45:49.149 --> 03:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
someone who has those documents in
 
03:45:52.349 --> 03:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
clothing and I understand your point sir
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I can answer with a with an
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
experience that I had of arresting a a
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
drunk driver in my neighbor's driveway
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
after he got stuck there after making a
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
100o turn in my other neighbor's
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
driveway it was a a Friday night it was
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh 10:00 at night I ran out there in my
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
jeans and and T-shirt with my gun on my
 
03:46:14.429 --> 03:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
hip and uh convinced him more by virtue
 
03:46:16.590 --> 03:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
of my conduct uh that I was law
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement but had I been required at
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
that point to to show him some ID and
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
satisfy um
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
his demand of me to prove who I was at
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
that point um we would have had a
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
different kind of situation more of a
 
03:46:34.830 --> 03:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
stalemate I suppose so um your point is
 
03:46:36.750 --> 03:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
is well taken and generally generally
 
03:46:39.149 --> 03:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
speaking we do have ID with us and and
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
we do uh let people know who we are
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
without without delay follow up sure
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah just a f a follow-up comment to
 
03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
that I was TR I wasn't trying to reply
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
what a police officer might do or might
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
not do yes sir I was trying to say that
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill replaced the other one it
 
03:47:02.670 --> 03:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
would it would limit it would limit it
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to people that actually had a uniform
 
03:47:08.110 --> 03:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
and had whatever could be the only
 
03:47:10.510 --> 03:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
people that would be subject to the new
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
B new law where the other one includes
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
all any person that tries to impersonate
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
an officer MH anyway I'll leave it at
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes sir so major if if I
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
ask how would this
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
affect a an officer
 
03:47:34.349 --> 03:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe an off duty officer you know
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know the the famous movie scenes
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
right you're at the diner and Pulp
 
03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
Fiction right you're at the diner and
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
something's about to go
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
down tell her to chill and
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
now what would H like what would happen
 
03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:48.870 align:start position:0%
now what would H like what would happen
I

03:47:48.870 --> 03:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
I what would happen because you're not
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
in uniform right right but you're
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
clearly an officer and now you have this
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
Duty how would that how would this
 
03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:02.070 align:start position:0%
Duty how would that how would this
affect

03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
it the way that I read it as written it
 
03:48:31.630 --> 03:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
places the burden on me to prove to that
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
person before they will submit to my
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
exercise of authority that I am a
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
person uh vested with powers that they
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
ought to recognize and uh to obey in
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
order for their conduct to
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
be either lawful or at least not uh
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
unlawful further okay so it's
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
um that's really the issue is in the
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
midst of a of an evolving tactical
 
03:49:06.990 --> 03:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
situation uh to say you just keep their
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
your hands where they are and then I'll
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
produce my ID for you is uh an untenable
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
circumstance to be in furthermore it the
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
courts have ruled that that merely to
 
03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
speak to people in public under certain
 
03:49:26.189 --> 03:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances can be viewed as as a
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
detention and so um the extent to which
 
03:49:32.149 --> 03:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
we walk by someone on the sidewalk and
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
just talk about the weather and say
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
hello and leave it at that uh versus ask
 
03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:37.830 align:start position:0%
hello and leave it at that uh versus ask
a

03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
question about the fact that we're in a
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
business that's closed and it's at night
 
03:49:45.870 --> 03:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
um the those are all issues that are
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
always taken into consideration by the
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
court so what is at the end of the day
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
an exercise of power is uh or authority
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
is very carefully scrutinized by the
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
court so at what point in reality my
 
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
exercising my authority would then be
 
03:50:04.149 --> 03:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
subject to my satisfying the Curiosity
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the person who is subject to that
 
03:50:08.910 --> 03:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
Authority that I am who I say I am um
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
that clearly is a is problematic
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
down representative Sabor D Schwaner
 
03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:29.670 align:start position:0%
down representative Sabor D Schwaner
thank

03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam Shar sir thank you
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
for my question um is there already an
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
anti-harassment law on the books that
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
might cover this already like the
 
03:50:42.550 --> 03:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
example that was
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
given know that certainly by
 
03:50:47.790 --> 03:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
representative corkran that it was a
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
definitely harassment is there was this
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
is this adding to would this be adding
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
um a law I'm not sure I can say with
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
confidence for people who we this
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
uniform to have conducted themselves in
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
that way um would subject them to uh at
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
least internal
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
repercussions uh whether or not the
 
03:51:16.149 --> 03:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
conduct was illegal based on the
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
description I it strikes me as
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
impersonation and clearly there's a law
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh that makes that illegal but um
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
harassment I'm I'm not really the
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
no I've been informed that this is an
 
03:51:41.550 --> 03:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
addition and not a replacement yes sir
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to go back to the
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
scenario that you described
 
03:51:50.189 --> 03:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
and looking at this um in the instance
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
that you describe since this says any
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
person not wearing their official
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
uniform so they don't have but they
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually do have if it says without
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
their official uniform it says the
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
person must be someone who has an
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
official uniform and then fails to
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
provide to fails to wear it and fails to
 
03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
provide identity would then be subject
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
to a class B
 
03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
felony and I think that language is just
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
kind of crazy it just it because it
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
limits it to the police and I'm not sure
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
what the intent to accomplish with this
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
because it all it's also goes on and
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
says to say uh uh it has a carve out for
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
any officer who is a law enforcement and
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
engaged in undercover
 
03:52:42.670 --> 03:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
activity you know so I just think this
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
is all about official police that don't
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
produce their identity in or wear their
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
uniform and I just don't think that this
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
would be enforcable or wise do you do
 
03:52:56.830 --> 03:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
you agree with that or do you I do sir
 
03:53:02.149 --> 03:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
you well and
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
it uh engaged in legitimate who
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
determines what's legitimate and the
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
pre-approval approved by whom so it's a
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
sir thank you very much major I think I
 
03:53:22.750 --> 03:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
think we're on the same page thank you
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
mad thank you very
 
03:53:26.830 --> 03:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else here that
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify on house bills six
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%

the board of directors for the police
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
department um this bill is uh the next
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
step in a process that began 3 or 4
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
years ago when uh representative Roy uh
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
and Senator then Senator Harold French
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh introduced
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
bills one in the house and one in the
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
Senate to uh require uh in written
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
informed consent uh when an officer uh
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
when a off when an officer searches a
 
04:01:44.110 --> 04:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
car if if the person agrees to have the
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
car searched and Al it it alternatively
 
04:01:50.149 --> 04:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
it required the officer before an
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
individual made the decision about
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
whether to consent or not to inform them
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have they had a
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional right not to consent and
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
that uh their refusal to consent to a
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
search of the motor vehicle would not be
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
held against them in any way um that was
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
the substance of that bill um and uh it
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
passed uh through both uh the house and
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh I believe on consent
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
calendar if I'm not mistaken um and this
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
is the next step in that bill um where
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
we just include all searches of property
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
where an officer uh is obtaining consent
 
04:02:30.149 --> 04:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
to search it's like effectively uh I
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
think uh representative Roy referred to
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
it when he testified on this on the
 
04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
earlier version of this he referred to
 
04:02:42.269 --> 04:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
it as basically giving uh people who are
 
04:02:45.149 --> 04:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
being asked to consent to search
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
something akin to Miranda rights U just
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh here are your constitutional
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
rights as to whether you have to consent
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
to search or not and uh so this is the
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
next step to uh finish off that uh uh
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
the scope of that bill um I I can only
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
speak for uh uh Portsmouth uh police but
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh it I I talked with the chief there
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
and this is a not this was a nonissue
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
for him
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
um I think many police departments
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
already do this um so uh there's the
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
good representative Murphy thank you she
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
resist can you tell me thank you for
 
04:03:42.910 --> 04:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I in all fairness
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
I haven't read this every single line of
 
04:03:47.550 --> 04:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
this but what
 
04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
um would this bill as written preclude
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
the ability of law enforcement to if a
 
04:04:00.269 --> 04:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
person denied access to um to the trunk
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
of their
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
car what if and I'm just thinking
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetically they kidnapped somebody
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
and they're in the back of their truck
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
back of their car law enforcement if the
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
person then says no you can't you can't
 
04:04:15.389 --> 04:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
search my car law enforcement then needs
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
to get a search warrant I'm assuming
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
correct uh in most circumstances there
 
04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
can be circumstances where law
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement if they have probable cause
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
to search the car they may not under
 
04:04:32.670 --> 04:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances need to go get a
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
search warrant but what they could do if
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
they needed to get a search warrant uh
 
04:04:42.030 --> 04:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
they again this all depends on the
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances they could seiz the car
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
temporarily while they went and got the
 
04:04:47.479 --> 04:04:49.429 align:start position:0%
temporarily while they went and got the
search

04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
search
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
warrant okay but this doesn't get in the
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
way of that process this just says when
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking for consent they have to
 
04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
let the person know uh that they have a
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional right not to consent and
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
if they decide to consent get that in
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
writing or on a body Camp so this
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't get in a way of anything a
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
police officer could do based on uh
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge they had to get into the the
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
trunk of the car without consent so
 
04:05:18.429 --> 04:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
should a person not consent under these
 
04:05:20.550 --> 04:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
like exent circumstances the police
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
officer can still get into that Tru yeah
 
04:05:26.830 --> 04:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm too much of a professor so depending
 
04:05:29.189 --> 04:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
on the specific circumstances yes
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes they' have to get a search
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
warrant sometimes they would I I I I
 
04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
just want to be accurate in describing
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
the law but this doesn't get in the way
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
either way of
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:45.710 --> 04:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
since this bill encompasses it it looks
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
like it encompasses all property would
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
that include things uh like electronic
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
equipment like computers and cell
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
phones uh yes I mean mean it's already
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh the US Supreme Court has already
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
decided that uh even if the police found
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
your cell phone on the side of the road
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
and there could pick it up as what
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
seemed to be abandoned property um or
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
they came across the your cell phone
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
legally through a search incident to
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
arrest which they're allowed to do the
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court has said nonetheless to
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
get into the cell phone they need to get
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
a search warrant unless they have
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
consent I mean they could get consent
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
and this would this and and and they
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's what would apply this would apply
 
04:06:33.670 --> 04:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
to they would have to say simply you
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
have the right not to give us
 
04:06:38.670 --> 04:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
consent um and uh if you do give us
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
consent please sign up here if you
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
decide not to give us consent uh we're
 
04:06:45.070 --> 04:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
not going to hold against you doesn't
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
get in the way of them go getting a
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
search warrant if they have the
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
necessary problem
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%

period of time shall mean the person in

the law enforcement agency involved has
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
ceased to interact with one another and

said if one person says no that's
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
enough the police then detain the
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%

04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
back to the house and ask for consent
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
from the wife and she consent
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
and they find a bunch of incriminating
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
information US Supreme Court said that's
 
04:08:22.030 --> 04:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
fine if the person is Spirited Away
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where the police
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
May return to the house or they may
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
acquire further
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
information and they may come back and
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
say to the
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
individual hey we know this now now do
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
you want to let us
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
consent and uh if the person says you
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
know they've got to inform them again of
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
these rights but what that language does
 
04:08:51.000 --> 04:08:52.030 align:start position:0%
these rights but what that language does
is

04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
it it tries to create prevent the
 
04:08:59.469 --> 04:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
police from getting a warrant coming
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
back well no it doesn't try to prevent
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
from getting a warrant they can always
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
get a warrant tries to prevent the
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
police from just coming back every 10
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
minutes without a change in
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances to keep trying to get
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
consent trying to put pressure on in
 
04:09:15.910 --> 04:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
that way that's what that language is
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
intended to account for so that doesn't
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
happen it's fine if the circumstances
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
are changed they can come back and ask
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
for consent if they want or or they can
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
go get a search War if they want but we
 
04:09:29.149 --> 04:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't want them coming back every five
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
or 10 minutes to keep trying without new
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
information that's a form of
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
intimidation that that we this tries to
 
04:09:37.119 --> 04:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
intimidation that that we this tries to
deal

04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
mic good afternoon my name is stepen
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
Anderson I'm an assistant County
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
attorney in Marat County um I've been a
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years years and I
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
I do oppose this bill um in New
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all searches have to be
 
04:10:22.990 --> 04:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
conducted pursuant to either a warrant
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
or an exception to that warrant
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
requirement consent is an exception to
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
the warrant requirement and consent that
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
exception has been developed over years
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
through case law um as representative sh
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
indicated he cited a number of Supreme
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
Court cases this is something that again
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
has been developed through case law
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
under our current case law there's no
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to inform a person that they
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
have the right to refuse consent under
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
our current case law there's also no
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that any type of written
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
form or anything like that be
 
04:10:59.920 --> 04:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
form or anything like that be
required

04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:11:04.990 --> 04:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
as as representative Sher said this is
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
sort of like a Miranda for consent but
 
04:11:10.349 --> 04:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
this actually goes much further than
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
Miranda rights go because
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire there's no
 
04:11:16.389 --> 04:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
requirement that Miranda rights be
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
written down or that we have a form uh
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
formally waving them so this actually
 
04:11:26.790 --> 04:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that it doesn't just require
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's to be informed it requires that
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
aning to be in writing or on body warn
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
camera that creates difficulties because
 
04:11:38.109 --> 04:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
there may be times when the officer
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the form with them or
 
04:11:42.389 --> 04:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a body warn camera and then
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
would simply be precluded from asking
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
for consent because you don't have a
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
form the language in the bill itself is
 
04:11:51.880 --> 04:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
form the language in the bill itself is
actually

04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I think confusing and I say that
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
because under current 595 A10 which is a
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
statute I'm certainly not in love with
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
um section one that starts online five
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
says a law enforcement officer May
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
legally conduct a search of a person's
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
home or any other property including a
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle without a warrant if the
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer expressly
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
informs the person of these two
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
things it seems odd to me that it
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually require the person a
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
consent it just requires the officer it
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
says the officer May legally conduct a
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
search if you say these two things
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
certainly that's not what it means it
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
means you actually have to have the
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
person agree to consent but it it
 
04:12:40.510 --> 04:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly say
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
that the form itself under paragraph
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
three at line
 
04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
24 says that the form itself needs to
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
provide notice of the provisions of
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
paragraphs one and two so the way this
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
ends up working is if this passed and it
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
came to me I'd be tasked with creating a
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
consent form for the police departments
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
within the county and I can tell you
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
that what I would do is simply cut and
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
paste paragraphs 1 and two so that there
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
was no question that my form um complied
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
with the statute if I did that my form's
 
04:13:19.389 --> 04:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
going to include the language in
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph two if the per if if you
 
04:13:24.429 --> 04:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
refuse to consent to a search the law
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer shall cease any
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
further questioning concerning consent
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
to search unless a significant period of
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
time has passed
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
or you rais the subject of consent a
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
significant period of time shall mean
 
04:13:38.590 --> 04:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
the per and law enforcement agency
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
involved have ceased to interact with
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
one another in a new set of
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances or facts have arisen that
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
justify new
 
04:13:47.070 --> 04:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
interaction I think that just becomes
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:55.389 --> 04:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
form the other concern I have about this
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
bill and it's similar to the concern I
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
expressed before is that there's this
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
exclusionary provision in
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
it that
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
says um any search that violates this
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
section will result in the evidence
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
being excluded
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
what concerns me about that is the
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule is a fairly severe
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
remedy that is employed for
 
04:14:19.600 --> 04:14:21.070 align:start position:0%
remedy that is employed for
constitutional

04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
violations whereas here we're not
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
talking about necessarily a
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation we're talking
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
about a statutory
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
violation um if the officer doesn't use
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
the right form doesn't have a form but
 
04:14:37.389 --> 04:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
does in fact obtain what would normally
 
04:14:37.399 --> 04:14:38.349 align:start position:0%
does in fact obtain what would normally
be

04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
regular good consent we're suppressing
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
all the evidence as a result result of
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
that and I I think that certainly
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
excluding all evidence is a is a is a
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
major um a major hurdle uh for a
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
statutory violation i' be happy to
 
04:14:58.000 --> 04:15:00.309 align:start position:0%
statutory violation i' be happy to
answer

04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%

planning on testifying but but now here
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
I am introducing the bill so I'm happy
 
04:30:48.269 --> 04:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that you may have
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
HP 468 addresses a gap in the law around
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
the regulations for use of an unmanned
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
aerial vehicle and
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
drone these drones are being used a lot
 
04:31:05.950 --> 04:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
more often as we saw in 2024 November
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
13th to now they're still being seen in
 
04:31:11.710 --> 04:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
the air there was a significant increase
 
04:31:14.750 --> 04:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
of drone incursions over the East Coast
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
the West Coast you saw on December 13th
 
04:31:20.670 --> 04:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
and December 17th right Patterson Air
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
Force Base in Ohio was shut down because
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
of these drones on 11 December Chinese a
 
04:31:31.109 --> 04:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
Chinese National was arrested outside of
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
vanderberg vanderberg Air Force Base for
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
flying one of these drones uh the
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
legislation sets up a tiered system
 
04:31:43.149 --> 04:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
whereby somebody who was lying a Joan
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
unlawfully against FAA regulations for
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
their first time would
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a violation for the first
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
offense a misdemeanor for a subsequent
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
offense that's F that's found on lines
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
12 through
 
04:31:59.469 --> 04:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
15 the next
 
04:31:59.479 --> 04:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
15 the next
paragraph

04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
has outlines the system by which if
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
someone is interfering with human
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
occupied aircraft or other wising
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
impeding the normal course of operations
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
of international Regional municipal or
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
general aviation airports that that
 
04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
person would be guilty of a Class A
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and a class B felony if such
 
04:32:22.590 --> 04:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
operation resulted in the damage of a
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
human occupied aircraft and a class a
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
felony if that was resulted in the the
 
04:32:31.229 --> 04:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
damage of a human human occupied
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
aircraft alongside serious death or or
 
04:32:37.149 --> 04:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
injury so I think this tiered system
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
that we have set up here is
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
pretty moderated I think the penalties
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
are appropriate for the crimes that they
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh have committed if you're flying a
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
drone in airports airspace and your
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
drone you know people think oh it's just
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
a small drone it's it's no problem but
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
if you know anything about aircraft air
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
travel if that plane's coming down at
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
hund and some odd miles an hour 130ish
 
04:33:09.310 --> 04:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
and they're about to land and a drone is
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
in its flight path that drone could go
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
right through the fusil lodge right
 
04:33:16.109 --> 04:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
through uh the engine and and create
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
some very serious problems and we've
 
04:33:20.189 --> 04:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
seen that happen in the instances in
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
which a drone has crashed into a plane
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
or or something or the other so this is
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
a serious crime the skies should be
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
protected and open the United States I
 
04:33:33.390 --> 04:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
think loves its air travel we should be
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
making air travel safer and more secure
 
04:33:37.869 --> 04:33:37.879 align:start position:0%
and not not littering our skies with
 
04:33:40.269 --> 04:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
these drones that are operating in many
 
04:33:42.429 --> 04:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
instances illegally
 
04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
so happy to take any questions about
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation and the
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
specifics around it but I hope at some
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
level that the committee is able to find
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
some way to to fill this Gap and I think
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
HB 468 fills it properly thank you madam
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I believe you covered it but I just
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to to clarify if I may so when we
 
04:34:06.750 --> 04:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
had this
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation last term I believe it was a
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill and and representative
 
04:34:16.349 --> 04:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
Newman actually got us a very quick
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it I think if I'm not
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
mistaken it went like misdemeanor felony
 
04:34:23.150 --> 04:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
felony and we wanted to make it
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
violation you know misdemeanor felony
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
and then our other friends came back and
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't do that and I did away with
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
it on the house floor and may have been
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
heckled by that by some of my other
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
friends so this is now addressing the
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
concern that that we at least had in
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
this committee last year of let's step
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
right like Step Up the Ladder instead of
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know going over jump off the cliff
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
jump absolutely yeah absolutely Madam
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
chair I remember that legislation and I
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
thought to myself why is the criminal
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
justice committee dealing with drones
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and unmanned aircraft here but it
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually became clear in research that
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is something that's uh and I think
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
yes this legislation addresses the
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had on this committee
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
last spum and and moves us forward in a
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
way that hopefully we won't have to
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
throw it off the cliff again
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:35:18.269 --> 04:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
representative representative suborn
 
04:35:21.551 --> 04:35:21.561 align:start position:0%
yeah you that was a good try thank you
 
04:35:23.070 --> 04:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
madam Sherman I have to keep my note out
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
that tells me how to say
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
it representative wheeler much much
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
simpler last name by the way um so the
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
only restrictions on
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
flight anywhere it appears it's just you
 
04:35:39.629 --> 04:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
can fly your drone anywhere except over
 
04:35:42.750 --> 04:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
a federal State Correctional
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
item number four correct that's the
 
04:35:48.029 --> 04:35:48.039 align:start position:0%
only that can be flown that's correct
 
04:35:50.910 --> 04:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
okay or otherwise regulated by the FAA
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
so you can fly at your house unless your
 
04:35:55.150 --> 04:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
house becomes an FAA no fly zone for
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
some reason or the other you know but
 
04:35:57.439 --> 04:35:59.070 align:start position:0%
some reason or the other you know but
thank

04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
you if you live airp right would the
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill Encompass flying a drone over
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
private property you don't
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
own that's a good question
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative Muse I would say that if
 
04:36:13.869 --> 04:36:13.879 align:start position:0%
you fly that would be a different piece
 
04:36:16.349 --> 04:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
of the law than than the law trying to
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
protect the aircraft and the airspace
 
04:36:21.629 --> 04:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
itself I would be interested in trying
 
04:36:21.639 --> 04:36:22.470 align:start position:0%
itself I would be interested in trying
to

04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
address flying drones over private
 
04:36:26.189 --> 04:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
property when you don't have the
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
permission of that person who's owns the
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
property and I know that came up in the
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
conversations last year how do we
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
identify what drone where that's coming
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
from um but I think that would be maybe
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
a separate piece of legislation but
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
happy to whatever you in the committee
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
feels is necessary on this thank you
 
04:36:43.520 --> 04:36:46.750 align:start position:0%
feels is necessary on this thank you
thank

04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
you would you believe that when I was on
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
Edna we addressed a lot of those things
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
about drones flying over people's houses
 
04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
and taking pictures you take pictures as
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
long as they were not
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
recognizable if I remember correctly I
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
would believe that and I'm going to have
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
research representative Shear do do you
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
know if
 
04:37:15.070 --> 04:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh the commercial entities that sell
 
04:37:15.080 --> 04:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh the commercial entities that sell
these

04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:37:19.510 --> 04:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
drones accompany the sale with some
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
notification of what the fa FAA
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
regulations are I mean you know I'm a
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
little my guess is the average lay
 
04:37:29.830 --> 04:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
person who may buy a drone because it's
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
kind of fun and interesting they have no
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
clue whatsoever what the f FAA
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
regulations are I would say ignorance is
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
not an excuse that's absolutely right
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I would say
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
I've never bought one of those drones
 
04:37:45.390 --> 04:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
that are very expensive now I haven't
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
even looked because they're so expensive
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
I know I'm not even going to give my S
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know I'd love to have one of those
 
04:37:52.029 --> 04:37:52.039 align:start position:0%
drones so I'm not even going to look but
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
what I can say is there there are tear
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
of those drones I do know that and the
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
drones that are readily available um are
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
often times not the ones that would stay
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
up long enough or be able to
 
04:38:05.949 --> 04:38:05.959 align:start position:0%
fly uh high enough to cause these kind
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
of problems and and I guess I would say
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
like representative Road said I keep
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
wanting to call you representative Roy
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
cuz that's the name tag right in front
 
04:38:15.390 --> 04:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
of you but but like representative Road
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
said uh that there you go um the not
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
knowing is not is not a reason enough
 
04:38:25.709 --> 04:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
not to be compliant if you're if you're
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
choosing to fly an aircraft you should
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
you should know that there are
 
04:38:31.470 --> 04:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
regulations for our skies and especially
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
if you're living around an airport or an
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
FAA regulated area yeah I'm not so
 
04:38:37.869 --> 04:38:37.879 align:start position:0%
concerned with the living around an
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
airport or a penal institution or house
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections followup representative sh
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry my concern is you
 
04:38:51.029 --> 04:38:51.039 align:start position:0%
know the the set paragraph two um I mean
 
04:38:53.629 --> 04:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
you know and I know that probably most
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
of the people that buy their first Grown
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
have no clue what the limits are and it
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
would be you know as a a matter of
 
04:39:05.789 --> 04:39:05.799 align:start position:0%
notice it would be nice to have do you
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice to have them uh
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of what those regulations are
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely and as you were talking I was
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of myself you know conversation
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
that I had with representative Harriet
 
04:39:18.750 --> 04:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
goth right outside before this she asked
 
04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
where is the feds on this and I would
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
say that's something that the federal
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
government should encourage companies
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
which are producing these drones to make
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a notice that says
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
you should follow and comply with FAA
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
regulations if you are to fly one of
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
these aircraft thank you thank
 
04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
you I would be interested to see how
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
many people actually read the notices
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
you know don't remove your tag from your
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
nutrition labels right representative n
 
04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
and looking through so the difference
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
between a Class A a class B felony and a
 
04:39:55.628 --> 04:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
class a felony is just to quote really
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
quickly a class B felony if uh such
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
operation results in damage to a human
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
occupied air uh aircraft in flight and
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
then class a felony is if such operation
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
causes said air said aircraft to crash
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
and such crash results in death or a
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury so what's
 
04:40:16.510 --> 04:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
interesting to me about that and I would
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
love for you to comment on it is the
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
difference between a Class A Class B and
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
a Class A is whether serious bodily
 
04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
injuries is it's not the if you cause
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
let me try and say it better because I
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
would think that regardless if you
 
04:40:37.868 --> 04:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
caused a manned uh aircraft to crash
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the person sustained
 
04:40:41.708 --> 04:40:41.718 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury would think it
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
would be the same level of felony you
 
04:40:48.270 --> 04:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
know what I mean so the separation is in
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
what harm came of it to the individual
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
rather than the fact that you could have
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
caused that harm it just didn't happen
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
to happen you know what I mean I think I
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
yes and um I would say the class B
 
04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
felony is just such that you would be
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
guilty of a class B felony if the human
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
occupied craft were damaged but still
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
flyable so there are instances in which
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know a drone could hit a craft that
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
craft could still land properly and that
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
person would be fine in which case class
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
B felony but if the Drone or whatever
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
aircraft is being operated crashes into
 
04:41:29.070 --> 04:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
the craft that CRA that craft then
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
crashes it's human occupied then that
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
person would be a class a felony I think
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's where the distinction comes if if
 
04:41:37.868 --> 04:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
the craft can still if it's just damaged
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
but it can still land it hasn't crashed
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
then then it's not as high as a class a
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
felony I think that's where the
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
distinction came in but I'm not the
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
drafter for can I follow up real quick
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
because the place where it says crash is
 
04:41:54.270 --> 04:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
in section c there or the you know that
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
Clause where it's talking about if it
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
causes it to crash and the Crash results
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
so it's just interesting to me that it's
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
separated in that way because I think if
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
it crashed and didn't cause because the
 
04:42:07.708 --> 04:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
and is in there if it crashed and it
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
didn't cause serious bodily injury or a
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
death then it would still be included in
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
damage the way that I'm reading it maybe
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm okay I think I see what you're
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
saying now so you're
 
04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
saying a person would be guilty of a uh
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
a class a felony if the operations
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
caused the aircraft to crash and if that
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
crash resulted in death or serious
 
04:42:30.200 --> 04:42:31.390 align:start position:0%
crash resulted in death or serious
bodily

04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
bodily
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
injuries I would still say that those
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
are different than the class B felonies
 
04:42:38.430 --> 04:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
because the class B felony is such that
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's just damage of the of the airc
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
the class a felony comes when that
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
aircraft crashes and such crash result
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
in death or serious bodily injury okay
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to talk with you a little bit
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
more afterwards about
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
proof oh yeah so I do believe that when
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
you buy a drone the basic Federal FAA a
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
warning is in the Box you can only fly
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
so high you have to be so far away from
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
an airport or an inclusion
 
04:43:20.958 --> 04:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
an airport or an inclusion
Zone

04:43:23.910 --> 04:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
Zone
 
04:43:27.310 --> 04:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
yep representative
 
04:43:29.470 --> 04:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the things that we talked
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
about uh when we talked about a similar
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
Bill last year was sort of the the
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
weaponization of drones so the the bill
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like it would cover
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
things like somebody the Drone into a
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
person like injuring a person
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally with a drone releasing a
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
package that would injure a person you
 
04:43:51.310 --> 04:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
know and I know in Manchester there was
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
an issue with somebody dropping fe's on
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
some homeless people with a drone in
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
Ukraine they're dropping things that are
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
a lot worse on people and so that Bas
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the technology is for this has
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
really kind of come a long way in a year
 
04:44:06.590 --> 04:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
and the the ability you know to actually
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
do harm to people
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
um would one of the things that just
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
occurs to me is in the part where we
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
make a class a felony in addition maybe
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
to causing the aircraft to crash uh you
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
know and having that result in serious
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
death or B bodily injury it's it could
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
be the the intentional misoperation of
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
the Drone itself you know or uh use of
 
04:44:33.550 --> 04:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
the Drone um you know to to basically
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
harm another human being uh it seems
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
like would be an appropriate addition
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what you would think
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
of that I I would agree I think that
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate addition when
 
04:44:46.510 --> 04:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
you see those videos of the people in
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
the trenches in Ukraine and they're just
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
sitting there and then the buzzing of
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
the drones around I mean drone Warfare
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
is one of the most horrific things that
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing these days and the
 
04:44:57.390 --> 04:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
weaponization of these drones is
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
concern representative PR it is already
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
unlockable in the state to weaponize a
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.390 --> 04:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
would we believe that it's already
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
illegal in this state representative
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
Pro would we believe that it's already
 
04:45:22.948 --> 04:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
illegal yes we believe thank you
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative right representative so
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
close representative Shear um I I was
 
04:45:32.190 --> 04:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
provoked by representative proof um it
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
would it would be a uh it would be if a
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
somebody ran a drone intentionally into
 
04:45:40.510 --> 04:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
a person and injured them that would be
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
a simple assault if they caused serious
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
bodily injury recklessly it would be a
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
class B
 
04:45:47.600 --> 04:45:49.350 align:start position:0%
class B
felony

04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
felony
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
Etc thank thank you guys remember we're
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be asking
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative wheeler
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you nice to see you nice
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
to see you as well Madam chair for the
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
record my name is Helen Hanks I'm the
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
Corrections I'm here in support and
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsors of HB 468 FN um
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
you'll find in my testimony I won't read
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
it because I know you will read it and
 
04:46:54.030 --> 04:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
take your time to review the information
 
04:46:58.110 --> 04:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
I provided to you I have been working um
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh for a number of years to both at our
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
federal level and uh supporting at our
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
state level all the work to protect our
 
04:47:08.590 --> 04:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities from uh I'm
 
04:47:10.510 --> 04:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to use the term drones uh you'll
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
see numerous examples in other states
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
where drones across the country are
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
dropping um drugs Firearms cell phones
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do not have uh drone detection in New
 
04:47:22.868 --> 04:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we see a visual drone we
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
shut down our yard it is uh chaos we
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
look to see if something's been dropped
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
we're using you know our cameras and our
 
04:47:32.708 --> 04:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
human eyes it is a challenge it is
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
unsafe um and I share that because there
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
should be a consequence and we are
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
mindful of uh individuals who do it
 
04:47:40.080 --> 04:47:41.548 align:start position:0%
mindful of uh individuals who do it
unknowingly

04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
unknowingly
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and we work with our state police
 
04:47:44.910 --> 04:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
partners and other partners in the state
 
04:47:47.350 --> 04:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
to help us identify the operators of
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
those drones when we can uh but they are
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
really upping the game in our
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
Correctional spaces across the country
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
where these uh Contraband items have
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
resulted in loss of life dropping
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
firearms that are used to actually end
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
the life of individuals who are working
 
04:48:04.150 --> 04:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
in these institutions in Georgia in
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
Idaho a cell phone was dropped to use uh
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
for escape that was successful uh the
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
list goes on and these protections are
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate when these uh drones are
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
used with Criminal Intent and the intent
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
to make things unsafe so I I thank you
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity and would also
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
share we did have a free pilot uh with a
 
04:48:26.350 --> 04:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
drone partner and um and it was
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
literally free which was nice and uh we
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
did identify at least three drones that
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
had been flying over our correctional
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
facility on our Southern campus here and
 
04:48:38.430 --> 04:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
and they did it um unknowingly and we
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
coached them but we really uh again need
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
this type of support I would be mindful
 
04:48:45.788 --> 04:48:45.798 align:start position:0%
I do not oversee uh County jails but I
 
04:48:48.548 --> 04:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
would point to line 26 and ask this
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
honorable committee to determine if it
 
04:48:52.990 --> 04:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
covers our County uh jail Partners in
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
this formal legislation would that uh
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
Avail myself for
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you we'll make sure we
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
make a note of line
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
26 you said just to make sure that they
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
also cover County facilities that we I
 
04:49:08.750 --> 04:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
would I would hope that this committee
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
would want to provide that type of
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
resource to our County Jail Partners
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative sheer
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
question you have a question right yeah
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think I do thank thank
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
you um you mentioned drone detection
 
04:49:25.708 --> 04:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
devices or systems are are there such
 
04:49:28.990 --> 04:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
things and how much do they cost uh
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative share there certainly are
 
04:49:32.190 --> 04:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
and they uh come with all different
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
price tags I can follow up with some uh
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
cost information we some Capital uh
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
budget proposals ago uh did ask for that
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
type of support we were off for
 
04:49:42.548 --> 04:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
different type of relief we asked that
 
04:49:44.590 --> 04:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
CLE year but I will get some updated
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
quotes for you do you have a followup do
 
04:49:50.310 --> 04:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
you have a broad range of the price
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
spread on those representative Sher I
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
think if I gave you a number I would be
 
04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
throwing a dart and I'd feel more
 
04:49:57.310 --> 04:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
confident if I had more time fair enough
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
you any any other questions yeah
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pro in those systems do
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
they have a way to take the Drone down
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is some of them do
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh some of them do I have not had that
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
validated to me yeah they definitely
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
identify where they are and before they
 
04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
cover your uh come into your secure
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
perimeter and you can I then reverse uh
 
04:50:25.150 --> 04:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
engineer the information to identify
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
where the operator is coming from but
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
your question is really important and
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
I've been told that they do but I'm not
 
04:50:33.990 --> 04:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%

of our Aviation unit um I I just want to

discuss this legislation um
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler and our
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
counterparts at Department of
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
Corrections I think have done a great
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
job so far laying the groundwork I just
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple uh additional things to
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
add um to to this um one one thing right
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
off the bat um is that this legislation
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
has been a collaborative effort amongst
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh all departments in the state here uh
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
including Department of Safety
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation uh
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections um it's been a
 
04:51:47.470 --> 04:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
cumulative effort over the past two or
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
so years uh to put this legislation
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
together with perspectives from uh
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
different viewpoints um not only from
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
the state side of things but also our
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
public uh partners and uh private
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
Partners as well um to really draft uh
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
and come to a agreement on uh the
 
04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
wording in this legislation to make it
 
04:52:08.350 --> 04:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh comprehensible but also um you know
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
Fair across the board for everyone's
 
04:52:10.080 --> 04:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
Fair across the board for everyone's
given

04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:52:14.548 --> 04:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
um different viewpoints um with that um
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
there is one uh at least technical
 
04:52:20.110 --> 04:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
correction or Amendment I'd like to
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
propose for the uh legislation that's
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
before you I do have copies I think
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
available for all the members here of
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
the committee um I've s have highlighted
 
04:52:30.030 --> 04:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
the area that we'd like to add some
 
04:52:32.430 --> 04:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
language to was just a brief paragraph
 
04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh reference to including um a penalty
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
for uh violating uh the operations of
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or firefighting or other
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
emergency responses uh in New Hampshire
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh and I'd be happy to pass that round
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh if that would be
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate if you just want to hand
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
that to representative Shear he'll be
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he'll be happy to pass it down
 
04:52:54.480 --> 04:52:57.390 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he'll be happy to pass it down
for

04:52:57.390 --> 04:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
us thank
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
you and if there are are not enough
 
04:53:03.990 --> 04:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
copies be happy to make some more uh and
 
04:53:06.670 --> 04:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
certainly send them your way um so that
 
04:53:08.110 --> 04:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
you'll notice when that comes around
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's a highlighted paragraph It's
 
04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
paragraph two in the strata language uh
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
and that reads a person is guilty of a
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if such person operates a
 
04:53:18.270 --> 04:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
small uas that interferes with law
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement firefighting other emergency
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
response operations or violates any
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 6449 in 6449 uh the
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA is speaking to our
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
privacy act um so we just want to make
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure that language uh was at least
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
considered and possibly included uh
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
going forward from from this point um so
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
just going back a little bit again this
 
04:53:44.350 --> 04:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
is like a cumulative effort on the part
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
of of many stakeholders to get this
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
legislation before you um and
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
essentially what this legislation does
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
it gives New Hampshire law enforcement a
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
tool to fall back on as representative
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
wheeler mentioned uh really at this
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
point in time there is no New Hampshire
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
law uh regarding uas or nefarious uas
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
operations uh and that really ties the
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
hands of New Hampshire law enforcement
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh currently as it as it stands um so
 
04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
this would give a option for law
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement if they do encounter
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who are using these for
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
nefarious purposes either um Criminal
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
Intent uh recklessly uh or carelessly um
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
obviously with the uh the the mindset
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
that you know any enforcement action um
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
would probably be uh you know pre pre uh
 
04:54:33.390 --> 04:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh predisposed to any some kind of some
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
kind of like education along the way so
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
prior to take enforcement action uh
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
there' be some education involved so the
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
idea at least from our perspective is
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
not to um take enforcement action
 
04:54:45.510 --> 04:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
broadly uh but only when it's
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
specifically needed and this would give
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in Hampshire the ability
 
04:54:50.910 --> 04:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
to do that when that obviously that
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
those situations call for it um as
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler had mentioned
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of incidents
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
across the country globally and even
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
locally uh involving the nefarious use
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
of drones or The Reckless operation of
 
04:55:03.548 --> 04:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
drones and that's why we think this
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
legislation in Hampshire is so
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
important um and with that I'd be happy
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you very
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
04:55:17.788 --> 04:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
pette thank you I was just wondering if
 
04:55:20.190 --> 04:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you just offered um
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
would include like um media related
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
drones and
 
04:55:29.670 --> 04:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
things um Ju Just so I I understand the
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
question uh for so media Outlets that
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
may be flying drones over a uh scene or
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
something like like those lines correct
 
04:55:40.548 --> 04:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
okay yes absolutely um that is not the
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
intent to restrict that from happening
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
um only if that conduct was interfering
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
with the Emergency Operations um for
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
instance um a recent event in California
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh wildfires a uh firefighting
 
04:55:56.110 --> 04:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
aircraft was struck by a drone and you
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
know that obviously uh deterred that uh
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
aircraft from you know helping put out a
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
fire so things along those lines is what
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
we' be looking at uh preventing with
 
04:56:04.638 --> 04:56:05.548 align:start position:0%
we' be looking at uh preventing with
this

04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:56:08.350 --> 04:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
legislation but it would yeah you're
 
04:56:11.350 --> 04:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
sorry but it wouldn't restrict media
 
04:56:14.030 --> 04:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
from you know doing their job at some
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
sort of scene fire scene emergency scene
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
something like that no it wouldn't only
 
04:56:19.548 --> 04:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
if it was interfering with the operation
 
04:56:21.788 --> 04:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
of that scene thank you you're welcome
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you just so every so everybody's
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
aware I know we have some uh new members
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
um what Mr ball has been kind enough to
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
give us is not actually an amendment
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's just some suggested verbiage that
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
he thinks might be helpful for us to add
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill if an amendment is done uh
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative MS
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
would you be open to changing your
 
04:56:45.788 --> 04:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
suggested changes in the language so
 
04:56:47.310 --> 04:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
that we could draft something that
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually preclude the media from
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
filming these scenes I think putting
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
guardrails around it is one thing um
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
when you eliminate it it's a freedom of
 
04:57:01.230 --> 04:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
the press issue yes yeah we we would be
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
open to that and and and certainly it's
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
not uh the intent at least from our
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
perspective to preclude media from from
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%

just a quick quick um brief overview um
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
for those who aren't familiar with our
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
office um we are the regulatory Agency
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
for all things aviation in the state um
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
we are the liaison to FAA for um pretty
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
much everything aircraft accidents uas
 
04:58:40.750 --> 04:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
um airport development
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
so um I don't want to repeat what um
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
Tripper ball had said we we have worked
 
04:58:49.470 --> 04:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
together um as a group um to develop
 
04:58:51.510 --> 04:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
some language that would hopefully be
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
one of the firsts to to provide some
 
04:58:59.310 --> 04:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
kind of guidelines to the use of uas um
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh full disclosure we we are a agency
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
that promotes Aviation so we are very
 
04:59:09.470 --> 04:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
much involved with the education from
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
children's students all the way up and
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
and that is one of our charges so um
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
working together with uh these Partners
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
were to help to try to make it more safe
 
04:59:22.270 --> 04:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
and and to allow law enforcement to have
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
some guidance on what they could do um
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
for those who are nefarious um and those
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
who tend to be repeat offenders so that
 
04:59:33.390 --> 04:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
is our goal um we're here um we're here
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%

PR to make a
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%

05:01:00.360 --> 05:01:01.948 align:start position:0%
it was the wrong wrong bill number I'm

05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your
 
05:01:26.910 --> 05:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
motion um I think that this bill is
 
05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and will interfere with law
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement's ability to execute their
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
duties representative appr would you
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
ditto does anybody have any
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
comments repres rep
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
schan I'm I know I know we chatted
 
05:01:58.990 --> 05:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
before but I'm I I think it's I know we
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
just heard it wondering if we could
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
maybe do an amendment for it or but I
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
know there was some I think the Crux of
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
the matter is how how how would this
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
affect um
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
um off-duty cops responding to an
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
emergency and and um yeah I guess
 
05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's fine so representative one of
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
the I I think the sponsors intent is is
 
05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually well heard and I I think I
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
speak for everybody when I don't think
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
that that fell on De ears I just don't
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
know that this is the avenue to address
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
the concerns that he had and and I'm
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
also not really sure what that Avenue
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
actually would be right um so if a
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
person that if an officer is an officer
 
05:02:54.030 --> 05:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
and they're doing
 
05:02:56.990 --> 05:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
something illegal and the intentions of
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
that something elicit that obviously is
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
illegal and and would need to be
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
addressed and I I'm very confident that
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
the leaders of those departments would
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
would handle that the best that they
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
could I really don't see how this could
 
05:03:14.910 --> 05:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
be to be e could be executed at all but
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
I I might be
 
05:03:16.400 --> 05:03:21.030 align:start position:0%
I I might be
misunderstanding

05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
um representative Shear is going to be
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
that this now I get to I could I talk
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
forever represent the floor is yours
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sher
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
um I think for for a few minutes anyway
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'll be very brief I think this is
 
05:03:44.110 --> 05:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
so poorly written that we have no idea
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
how it overlaps with uh 104 uh colon
 
05:03:54.670 --> 05:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
28a uh which it's added to um and it uh
 
05:03:57.868 --> 05:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
if there is a I'm still unclear what the
 
05:04:00.510 --> 05:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of what he was trying to do is
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
if he's trying
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
to uh it's unclear to me whether he's
 
05:04:07.470 --> 05:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent off-duty officers from
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
doing the kind of thing he the example
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
he gave of two people showing at
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's house and saying I'm an ice
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
agent um or whether he's trying to
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
prevent people who aren't law
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement in any way of doing that and
 
05:04:25.390 --> 05:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think what the way it's written
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
it's even clear what she's trying to
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
address and that that's my problem with
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
it I would I would agree representative
 
05:04:33.320 --> 05:04:34.830 align:start position:0%
it I would I would agree representative
representative

05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:38.430 --> 05:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
n thank you I think also just to add to
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
that it is very unclear it seemed pretty
 
05:04:43.948 --> 05:04:43.958 align:start position:0%
duplicatus but also considering the fact
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
that it's that unclear anyone who are
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
guilty of this is guilty of a class be
 
05:04:50.350 --> 05:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
felony which is a serious offense so at
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the day if we're going to be
 
05:04:52.750 --> 05:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
saying that we're going to hold somebody
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
accountable much less law enforcement
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
accountable for you know for um um
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
something like this I think we really
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
need to be clear on what it is and I
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
think they need to be clear on what it
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
is I agree representative
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just want to comment in
 
05:05:10.110 --> 05:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
the in the example that was given if two
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
people just show up and start asking
 
05:05:14.548 --> 05:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
those questions and doing that this law
 
05:05:16.270 --> 05:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
would not apply to them because they
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
would have to own a uniform that they
 
05:05:18.000 --> 05:05:21.150 align:start position:0%
would have to own a uniform that they
didn't

05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
wear anybody else it followup would be
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a followup because I can talk
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
can it would not apply to in my opinion
 
05:05:34.030 --> 05:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
it would not apply to the police because
 
05:05:36.270 --> 05:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
those folks that don't own an official
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
uniform that they should wear they don't
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
have one so they wouldn't be subject to
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
the bill that's actually a very good
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
point representative Newman so if you're
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
impersonating you don't have the uniform
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the first place right so that that is
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
clearly a law that's this is not going
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
to to fix that's actually
 
05:06:01.948 --> 05:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
a well stated actually um any anybody
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
else no more discussion representative
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair I was just
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
going to add um I believe it major Davey
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
who tested IFI that um you know ideally
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I think the sponsor was trying to
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
address one a one-off incident frankly
 
05:06:18.750 --> 05:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't try to legislate
 
05:06:22.510 --> 05:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
around you know oneoff instance but um
 
05:06:24.670 --> 05:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
in that case I don't think we
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the jurisdiction to
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
like force the FBI to respond to this
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry if they weren't I know willing
 
05:06:34.190 --> 05:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
to do so in person but I think the
 
05:06:37.070 --> 05:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
concern was that if law enforcement like
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
valid law enforcement officials are
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to execute a mission that is not
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
within their purview or execute um you
 
05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
know UH responsibilities I guess that
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
are outside of their perview um and then
 
05:06:53.670 --> 05:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
holding them accountable for that which
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
one I I don't think should be a class B
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
felony if that was the case I I think
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's more of what should be dealt with
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
is ensuring that there are internal
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
policies to address these circumstances
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
when they arise and that those policies
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
are being followed um which again I
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
think is a little bit more difficult
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a federal
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
department or federal
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
agency if if I'm not mistaken I do think
 
05:07:17.310 --> 05:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
that there is a bill that we're hearing
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
possibly next
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
week um actually it might be next 3:30
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
um that that I haven't read that bill at
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
all but just from the quick little
 
05:07:28.510 --> 05:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
synopsis here that might be what it's
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
about and
 
05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
um the the comment that we've heard a
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
few times about the example that was
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
given it is very unfortunate when you
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
actually know a person that that had a
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
wrong done to them right and generally
 
05:07:44.430 --> 05:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
when you are that person that's had that
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
done you just kind of want to shout that
 
05:07:46.990 --> 05:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
from the rooftops like you want
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
everybody to hear about this
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
Injustice and that that is unfortunate
 
05:07:54.150 --> 05:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it's happened to every single one of
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
us I but I stand pretty firm I don't
 
05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
think that this legislation is going to
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
address what that Injustice was at all I
 
05:08:04.830 --> 05:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
wish it did but I don't think that it's
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to so um with that I believe we
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
are everybody good we're ready to go
 
05:08:12.110 --> 05:08:12.120 align:start position:0%

the towns of New Boston Mount Vernon and
 
05:32:45.360 --> 05:32:46.510 align:start position:0%
the towns of New Boston Mount Vernon and
line

05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:32:50.350 --> 05:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
bro House Bill 640 before
 
05:32:50.360 --> 05:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
bro House Bill 640 before
you

05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
is it's a it's a almost identical Bill
 
05:33:01.628 --> 05:33:01.638 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 1411 from
 
05:33:04.910 --> 05:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
2022 that was put in by William Foster
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
who's a constituent New Boston he he is
 
05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
The Honorable William Foster um he was a
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
state representative in that
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
period House Bill 1411 passed the house
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
so an almost identical Bill to this one
 
05:33:23.788 --> 05:33:23.798 align:start position:0%
passed the house on a Division vote
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
March of
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
2022 the vote was 204 to 134 so a pretty
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
good majority it went to the Senate and
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh ended up not passing it so
 
05:33:38.430 --> 05:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
what I did was I looked at the Senate
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
testimony and I made some adjustments to
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
the bill based on the objection that the
 
05:33:43.558 --> 05:33:44.548 align:start position:0%
the bill based on the objection that the
Senate

05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
heard and that's six House Bill 640
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's before
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
you House Bill 640 directs the Attorney
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
General to collect specific data from
 
05:33:56.430 --> 05:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
federal agencies operating in our
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
state including the number of facilities
 
05:34:02.110 --> 05:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
staff surveillance operations
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
investigations warrants arrests Refugee
 
05:34:08.670 --> 05:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
relocations and Deport
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
pations this information would be
 
05:34:13.030 --> 05:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
published quarterly in an aggregated and
 
05:34:15.948 --> 05:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
anonymized form to protect
 
05:34:18.750 --> 05:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
privacy a public website would feature
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
searchable database quarterly summaries
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
and annual
 
05:34:25.310 --> 05:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
reports ensuring Clarity and
 
05:34:28.990 --> 05:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
public so this bill is about
 
05:34:35.310 --> 05:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
transparency and shedding light on
 
05:34:35.320 --> 05:34:36.510 align:start position:0%
transparency and shedding light on
government

05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:34:38.430 --> 05:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
activities uh
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
improves transparency it improves the
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
citizens relationship with the
 
05:34:42.360 --> 05:34:43.430 align:start position:0%
citizens relationship with the
government

05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
because uh we can see what they're doing
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
we understand to some degree what
 
05:34:46.958 --> 05:34:48.548 align:start position:0%
we understand to some degree what
they're

05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:34:51.070 --> 05:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
doing so it upholds the public right to
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
know empowers citizens with essential
 
05:34:56.548 --> 05:34:56.558 align:start position:0%
information fostering more informed and
 
05:34:58.830 --> 05:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
engaged community in New
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to note that the fiscal
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
note on this bill differs with the
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note from 14 House Bill 1411 in
 
05:35:12.310 --> 05:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
2022 to houseb 1411 fiscal note was
 
05:35:15.548 --> 05:35:15.558 align:start position:0%
indeterminable this fiscal note suggests
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill would require three
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
positions for $230,000 a
 
05:35:26.670 --> 05:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
year so given the the bill scope this
 
05:35:28.350 --> 05:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
estimate to me seems
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and I would recommend that
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
this committee requests of the
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to provide a
 
05:35:33.718 --> 05:35:35.548 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to provide a
detailed

05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
explanation for the investig ative
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
paralal legal assistant and attorney
 
05:35:48.510 --> 05:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
require so just in
 
05:35:54.030 --> 05:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion House Bill 640 would be a
 
05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
prudent measure it aligns with New
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tradition of
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
transparency it would equip citizens
 
05:36:03.670 --> 05:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
with knowledge and strengthen trust in
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
government and I urge you to support
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill it repes presents a vital
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
commitment to our democratic values and
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
Shear do uh we the legislature have the
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%

05:36:25.270 --> 05:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
to order the federal government to do
 
05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
anything yeah this is not an order this
 
05:36:29.868 --> 05:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
would be a request and part of the
 
05:36:31.830 --> 05:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
report would be whether they gave us the
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
information or not right so okay that's
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the the report
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions and I I did I when I walked in

I the the end of the bill talks
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%

05:36:55.280 --> 05:36:57.070 align:start position:0%
Relations Committee and
so

05:36:57.070 --> 05:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
um that committee I think would be the
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committee for our
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
relationship with the federal government
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
but they would be informed about
 
05:37:07.948 --> 05:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
activities thank you thank you
 
05:37:09.910 --> 05:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative was just making a note of
 
05:37:11.230 --> 05:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that you were talking
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
about right I I don't see any questions
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for coming in
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
today thank you and for the clerk I
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
emailed my testimony hold on one second
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
because I think the clerk just raised
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
her hand she does such a great job we
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't ever want to not give her her way
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I was just
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to ask and I might be missing it

is there um a frequency to when we're
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
requesting the report yes so House Bill
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
1411 which passed was monthly and this
 
05:37:40.350 --> 05:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
bill it's quarterly so we reduced the
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
frequency which uh oh I see now thank
 
05:37:42.920 --> 05:37:45.628 align:start position:0%
frequency which uh oh I see now thank
you

05:37:45.628 --> 05:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
y we're
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%

there the button on mic
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you can bring it closer to you as
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
well if you need to you can just slide
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
it right up then you don't have to I
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
should need that or I should know that
 
05:38:29.470 --> 05:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
um my name is William Foster I'm from
 
05:38:32.910 --> 05:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
New Boston New Hampshire I am the uh
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
former rep that wrote
 
05:38:37.990 --> 05:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
1440 and uh I wanted to test ify today
 
05:38:39.628 --> 05:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
so you guys understand where this came
 
05:38:39.638 --> 05:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
so you guys understand where this came
from

05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:38:45.468 --> 05:38:45.478 align:start position:0%
um I when I got into the legislature I
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
was assigned to the um to the
 
05:38:52.990 --> 05:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
um foreign relations and Veterans Affair
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee and I uh was also speaking
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
with one of my
 
05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
um constituents who talked to me a
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
little bit about the limited amount of
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we have you in the state
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
of what our federal government is
 
05:39:12.510 --> 05:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
doing and so I started going down that
 
05:39:14.910 --> 05:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole mostly because I wanted to
 
05:39:18.628 --> 05:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
find out more about um what are federal
 
05:39:20.070 --> 05:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
government's doing so that I would be
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
more useful with foreign relation or or
 
05:39:24.030 --> 05:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
with Federal
 
05:39:24.040 --> 05:39:25.948 align:start position:0%
with Federal
relations

05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
relations
 
05:39:28.628 --> 05:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
um as I went down that rabbit hole I
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
quickly discovered
 
05:39:34.708 --> 05:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
that we have extremely limited knowledge
 
05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
of what the federal government's doing
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
that is not centralized so that in order
 
05:39:41.788 --> 05:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
to get it I have to literally go and ask
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
each and every agency in the federal
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
government for that
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
information and that because of the
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause they are under no
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
obligation to give me any information
 
05:39:52.628 --> 05:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
whatsoever or they could give me limited
 
05:39:55.150 --> 05:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
information and not include
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
everything and so in thinking of well
 
05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
how can
 
05:40:04.590 --> 05:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
we get more of that knowledge because in
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
re in reality the relationship we have
 
05:40:08.270 --> 05:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
right now and the federal government is
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
one way um we have no idea and it's not
 
05:40:15.868 --> 05:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
just us it's not just you as your your
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
representatives of your districts but
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's the Senate it's it's um every bit
 
05:40:24.510 --> 05:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
of our state government all the way up
 
05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the um Governor if the federal
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
government doesn't want to tell you they
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell you and I I I thought
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
that was unfortunate and and from a
 
05:40:37.868 --> 05:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
completely um
 
05:40:40.350 --> 05:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
non-political standpoint that's
 
05:40:43.548 --> 05:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because
 
05:40:47.110 --> 05:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah as Representatives we want to try
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
to you know folks want to try to do
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
their best to represent
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
honorably um and so you would think that
 
05:40:57.990 --> 05:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
as a representative of people you would
 
05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
have nothing to hide and therefore hey
 
05:41:02.190 --> 05:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
let's have transparency because
 
05:41:04.110 --> 05:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
transparency develops trust and that's
 
05:41:05.708 --> 05:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
something that's really lacking in our
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
government right now so I started
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
looking into it but there's very little
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
you can do I put together uh 1440 and I
 
05:41:18.110 --> 05:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
did it on a monthly basis my goal wasn't
 
05:41:18.120 --> 05:41:19.628 align:start position:0%
did it on a monthly basis my goal wasn't
to

05:41:19.628 --> 05:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
um infringe on any operation they're
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
doing or expose anybody's personal data
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
or any of that I literally just wanted
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
to know what they were doing so that we
 
05:41:31.548 --> 05:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
could better plan at the state
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
level um and so I put it together
 
05:41:37.868 --> 05:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
because no we can't for for some but we
 
05:41:39.948 --> 05:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
can do one thing and that is
 
05:41:44.070 --> 05:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
ask um and so I thought well let's ask
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
them for it now they don't have to give
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
it to
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
us we're not going to be sure that
 
05:41:51.788 --> 05:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
they're giving us all the information
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
but at least we'll get some data points
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
and if they say we don't want to give
 
05:41:58.750 --> 05:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
you anything that's a data point
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
also um I don't think that people the
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people in the state
 
05:42:06.270 --> 05:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
understand the fact that they don't need
 
05:42:08.070 --> 05:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
to tell us anything
 
05:42:12.270 --> 05:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
and you may like the executive branch
 
05:42:14.110 --> 05:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
that's in power right now or you may not
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
like the executive branch that's in
 
05:42:18.390 --> 05:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
power right now either way they don't
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
have to tell you
 
05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
anything um transparency to me is very
 
05:42:26.750 --> 05:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
important as I say it it certainly grows
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
trust it allows us to see what folks are
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
doing yes we can ask them I think we
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
should ask them and I think we should
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
centralize that information I'm h oping
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
that this begins a discussion of just
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
how much the federal government is
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
telling us and what it's not so we could
 
05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
possibly get transparency between the
 
05:42:48.788 --> 05:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
two I think it would be much more
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
efficient if States knew what the
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
federal government was doing in them um
 
05:42:57.310 --> 05:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
so I put it together Keith came and and
 
05:42:59.948 --> 05:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
I talked with him and he I I thank him
 
05:43:01.868 --> 05:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
very much I should say sorry
 
05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative a I thank you very much
 
05:43:07.708 --> 05:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
for bringing this up um it did pass the
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
house I had some family issues and I was
 
05:43:12.110 --> 05:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
not able to walk it through the Senate
 
05:43:15.150 --> 05:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
the way it should be so it didn't get
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
through I don't think that there's that
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
this is a partisan issue in any way
 
05:43:24.548 --> 05:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
um I want to know what the federal
 
05:43:26.468 --> 05:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
government's doing no matter who's in
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
power I want to know what effects
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're having on our state are they
 
05:43:31.868 --> 05:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
doing things that we should be doing
 
05:43:34.590 --> 05:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
instead of them we can't answer those
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions and will this Sol that problem
 
05:43:40.350 --> 05:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
no but it is a very good step a very
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
small but good step in the right
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
direction of being able to say hey what
 
05:43:45.910 --> 05:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
are they
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
doing and the information they share
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
could become very useful
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
to you folks as representatives of the
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
people so what I'm asking for is that
 
05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
you pass it through
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
committee um as as as ought to pass I
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
would love to see it be something that
 
05:44:09.230 --> 05:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
is is supported by both sides of the
 
05:44:11.468 --> 05:44:11.478 align:start position:0%
legislature I think transparency is a
 
05:44:14.590 --> 05:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
very good thing for um government as a
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
whole and I think it would be a good way
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
to start building back some trust in it
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's my
 
05:44:24.270 --> 05:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
testimony any
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:44:26.080 --> 05:44:27.868 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
representative

05:44:27.868 --> 05:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:44:30.190 --> 05:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um I'm there are
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I just wonder
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
kind of what it would look like in
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
practice one thing I know um you know
 
05:44:39.868 --> 05:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
there's data that I like to follow
 
05:44:42.190 --> 05:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
particularly overdose rates and and
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
things like that um because that's
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
something that I'm you know passionate
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
about um and I know that a lot of times
 
05:44:50.430 --> 05:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
those things have a lag with them so
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
doing something quarterly I think would
 
05:44:54.510 --> 05:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
I think it might be difficult in
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
practice um to have upto-date numbers so
 
05:44:58.750 --> 05:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
even if you are reporting the numbers
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
you'd still be reporting on probably two
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
quarters ago or something like that but
 
05:45:06.468 --> 05:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
um you know one of a couple of things
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
but I was just wondering what kind of
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
feedback you got from the Senate and and
 
05:45:12.030 --> 05:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of things were addressed in
 
05:45:13.948 --> 05:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
making the new and and coming up with a
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
new language as I said I had some family
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
issues I didn't get feedback from the
 
05:45:19.390 --> 05:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
Senate but what I can tell you is this I
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
did put it in as as a monthly thing I
 
05:45:24.030 --> 05:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
thought that would be be doable in
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
reality it could it's a list of
 
05:45:28.590 --> 05:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions so it could be submitted by
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
the different we have a lot of agencies
 
05:45:32.910 --> 05:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
in the federal government and there's 72
 
05:45:35.468 --> 05:45:35.478 align:start position:0%
of them that have full-time armed people
 
05:45:38.110 --> 05:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
that can come in conduct conve
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
surveillance um serve warrants and
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
arrest people without having to tell a
 
05:45:44.350 --> 05:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
single person in our state government
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
um I put it in there at a monthly thing
 
05:45:53.468 --> 05:45:53.478 align:start position:0%
the other thing you'll notice about the
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
questions is all the questions are what
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
did you do last quarter because the
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
second you say what are you doing
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to fall behind the we
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't discuss ongoing investigations we
 
05:46:08.590 --> 05:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't discuss ongoing cases we don't uh
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
discuss our our
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
methodology so they they it gives them
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
if you try to ask them for current stuff
 
05:46:16.510 --> 05:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
it will give them an excuse not to give
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you anything can I ask a followup you
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
sure can I think some of these things as
 
05:46:25.350 --> 05:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
well I would assume um um and I know in
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
some contexts they do I would I would
 
05:46:28.990 --> 05:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
assume probably most um they would
 
05:46:31.310 --> 05:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
coordinate with local police with local
 
05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement have you had any luck in
 
05:46:35.030 --> 05:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
discussing it with local law enforcement
 
05:46:36.510 --> 05:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
and have you gotten any feedback or
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
state police or any other well no and
 
05:46:41.708 --> 05:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do and sometimes they
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
don't they are not required to discuss
 
05:46:46.270 --> 05:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
it with local law enforcement they're
 
05:46:48.430 --> 05:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
not required to tell the Attorney
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
General of the state what they're doing
 
05:46:53.350 --> 05:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
they can come in here and do whatever
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
they want and
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
literally go away and if you ask them
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
about it they can say we're not we have
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
no comment on
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
them and it's legal and I I think most
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
of you know that so well thank you do we
 
05:47:12.350 --> 05:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
do representative Murray thank you madam
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair um just out of curiosity do you
 
05:47:22.628 --> 05:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how likely these
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
agencies are to comply with these
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
requests CU I guess my concern would be
 
05:47:31.110 --> 05:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
if we put this in statute you know that
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has to do this on a
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis and if they're not
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
providing you know what I mean like just
 
05:47:36.160 --> 05:47:37.548 align:start position:0%
providing you know what I mean like just
repetitively

05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
repetitively
 
05:47:39.548 --> 05:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
well if they're not providing any
 
05:47:41.350 --> 05:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
information that's a real quick data
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
point for them to enter no response all
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
it shows is hey this this this agency
 
05:47:49.150 --> 05:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
has never responded or they haven't
 
05:47:51.390 --> 05:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
responded in the last year or two years
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever so um I I I think that if
 
05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
they don't respond it reduces the
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
workload to almost nothing anyways but
 
05:48:00.390 --> 05:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
at least we have that data point right
 
05:48:03.270 --> 05:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
now I can't tell you how many are going
 
05:48:06.868 --> 05:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
to respond it's never been tried and we
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
don't know I know that you get a a a
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
assortment of responses if you reach out
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
to individual
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
agencies and there's a lot of agencies
 
05:48:24.628 --> 05:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't know follow it um I know
 
05:48:26.110 --> 05:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
you've said that there are a lot of few
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
times do you know the number of agencies
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
not total agencies no I know that
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
there's over 70 agencies that have
 
05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
full-time armed okay uh agents
 
05:48:38.468 --> 05:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
that can operate within your state
 
05:48:40.350 --> 05:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
without having to say word yeah just
 
05:48:42.750 --> 05:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about the time it would take to
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
request all that I think it's the actual
 
05:48:46.350 --> 05:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
number I think the last time I looked
 
05:48:46.360 --> 05:48:47.190 align:start position:0%
number I think the last time I looked
was

05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:48:47.200 --> 05:48:50.190 align:start position:0%
was
72

05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
72
 
05:48:52.990 --> 05:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
so so so if I may ask a question so
 
05:48:54.830 --> 05:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
basically what
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're what you would like is somebody
 
05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the Attorney General's office to type
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
something up that says hey how many
 
05:49:06.510 --> 05:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are in New Hampshire and have
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
them list what those are and then what
 
05:49:12.030 --> 05:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
what they not what they're going to do
 
05:49:13.430 --> 05:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
what they what they did not their
 
05:49:15.788 --> 05:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
intentions of what they did and then if
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
they just don't answer then they just
 
05:49:19.590 --> 05:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't answer like do we know who they
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
would even send it
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
to God bless you that would be someone
 
05:49:26.510 --> 05:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the Attorney General's office okay so
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I just personally and this is
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
the last you know well not the last but
 
05:49:36.270 --> 05:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
this is this is what I will testify to I
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
think it is is ridiculous
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
that the that there is no centralized
 
05:49:46.110 --> 05:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
point for a representative or a senator
 
05:49:49.830 --> 05:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
a legisl a legislate from the state of
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to go and find out what
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government's doing within
 
05:49:55.680 --> 05:49:56.948 align:start position:0%
the federal government's doing within
the

05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:02.070 --> 05:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
exist any other
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no further questions
