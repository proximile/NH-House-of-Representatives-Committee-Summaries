00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
well good morning for the records Steve
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Smith uh director of audits for LBA
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
just to give the committee a quick
 
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
update of ongoing and audits since our
 
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
last meeting
 
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.130 align:start position:0%
last meeting
um

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the uh we issued a report or not really
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
a report or more of a letter on the
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
retirement system Healthcare subsidy
 
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
that went out on dated May 23rd so that
 
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
went to legislative leadership
 
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0%
and at this point no further actions
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
happening on that
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
on the dental examiners further action
 
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
need to be taken
 
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.550 align:start position:0%
need to be taken
uh

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
there I think it was really we just
 
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 align:start position:0%
outlined the issues as we saw it and
 
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
legislature would have to
 
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
there were some
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
Clarity I think that could be given to
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the laws as I recall statute
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
so but it's really up to the legislature
 
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
um with the board of General examiners
 
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
we've finalized that that audit uh that
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
will be going to fiscal next Friday
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
and some of you if your server on fiscal
 
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
might be getting it today
 
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
just to alert the committee it's it's
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
another large report so you have plenty
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
of holiday reading
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
um it's in excess of 300 pages with
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
dependencies there's 36 observations in
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
total and I just want to remind the
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee that part of the reason why
 
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's a large report is that it does
 
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
really reach into some of the inner
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
workings of oplc so you do have a
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
potential topic that has been brought up
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
before regarding oplc
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
I think this report this report will
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of the issues that the
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee may have had
 
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's about 10 I believe observations
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
that that relate to uh that involve oplc
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
and there's at least three that are
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
directly to oplc only so so just to make
 
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of that
 
00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
the mental health Workforce audit that's
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing we're in the middle of field
 
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.330 align:start position:0%
ongoing we're in the middle of field
work

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
work
um

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
I think maybe by we're wrapping up field
 
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 align:start position:0%
work middle of next month
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
and again because this involves a number
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
of different boards and commissions once
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
we get into the observation and getting
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
response to some observation that could
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
be strung out a little bit because of
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
the meeting schedules of the of those
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
particular boards and committees
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh weatherization uh State sure before
 
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
we go on could we go back to the board
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
of dental examiners
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that there were
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
several write-ups against the oplc
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
is this do you think true of other
 
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
boards or do you think they're what they
 
00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:55.850 align:start position:0%
boards or do you think they're what they
have

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
what you've put in the audit is just
 
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
strictly for the dental no no I believe
 
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.969 align:start position:0%
strictly for the dental no no I believe
that

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
um and Jay you can correct me from but I
 
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 align:start position:0%
believe it's it's the structure of oplc
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of the recommendations would would
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
feed into other boards of commissions
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's Central to whether their management
 
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.249 align:start position:0%
it's Central to whether their management
structure

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh their processes
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
some of the history of of what's gone on
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
at oplc and obviously
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
directly related to the board of dentals
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
but I think that that given what they do
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we've found will be
 
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
applicable to and apply to
 
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything that they do so
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
is there a need for restructure over
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
there or is it a Manpower issue or is it
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
well I I don't you know
 
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
I I I hesitate to get into any detail
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
here because we haven't presented at the
 
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal at this point in time that's when
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
technically the reports become public uh
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay you know what I mean so
 
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:07.189 align:start position:0%
okay you know what I mean so
um

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
but but I think there there is a variety
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
of those types of things are in there
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
on the weatherization assistance
 
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
on the weatherization assistance
um

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's a small operation over there
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
there's really a one-man shot we did we
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
get we did get started but they had a uh
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
a previously scheduled Federal audit
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
that they had to deal with
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
they also received a lot of new money
 
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
that they had to kind of work through
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
the the process of getting that
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
distributed and and controls and
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
everything around that we also had some
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
turnover on our side so
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
um things are stolen things are still
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
moving just slowly right now but I think
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
that they will pick up and um
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully I think we'll be able to we
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
have a few observations that we've
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
identified so maybe
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
February March time frame for
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
finalization and a report on that one
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
on the special education dispute
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
resolution process we're doing field
 
00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:10.730 align:start position:0%
resolution process we're doing field
work

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.110 align:start position:0%
work
um

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things we wanted to do to get
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
access to users of the dispute
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
resolution processes we needed to obtain
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
email addresses and information from the
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
local school districts we received a
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
little I'll say pushback but a
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
hesitation as to whether they had the
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
authority to do that to release that
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
information so we had to work through
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
some federal contacts and long and short
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
of it is is we can do it and local
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
um something like an email address to us
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
so we can reach out and and and do a
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
survey it's not considered a student's
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
education record per say it's just
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
contact information so
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so that that's ongoing so we're
 
00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
making progress there
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of the much broader
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
special education audit we're in now
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
that we're wrapping up Dental we're
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
starting to move on to that and so we're
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
in the planning stages of that and
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
developing a scope State well we already
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
have the scope statement approved so
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
and then the only other one that's in
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
our queue is the education Freedom
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
account but that won't occur until fall
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
of 2023 or over a year from now so
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
any questions that's kind of a quick
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
recap status of our ongoing audits uh
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on the education
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
Freedom account uh audit
 
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
Freedom account uh audit
um

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
looking at 2023 is that because of your
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce or
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
um I think that was uh
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
there was some when the when the statue
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
was the way the bill was being developed
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
how much information would be available
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
because it's a new program to be able to
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
be assessed and to be able to to look
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I think the the earliest
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
was our fall of 2023 to have something
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
that could be audited really
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
as well as enough activity to to
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
really what we need is we need we'd like
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
to get at least one topic to move
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
forward forward with so
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
can you suggesting the ones that were
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
here and we also have
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
representative representative here to
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay one or both of you tell us what you
 
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:11.569 align:start position:0%
okay one or both of you tell us what you
want

00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair morning members of
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh my name
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
is representative McLean uh representing
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 44 which is Manchester and
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
Litchfield and I was the chair and
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
interim study committee on the Human
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and with me is
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Marjorie Smith of Durham
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
um we had a bill come before us in
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
judiciary last year SB 296 the purpose
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
of the bill was pretty straightforward
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
it wanted to take away the right of
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
removal from the Human Rights Commission
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Courts to the
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
respondents and Reserve that right
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
exclusively for the claimants and
 
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:15.740 align:start position:0%
constitutionally legally that was sound
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
only two states allow removal by the
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
respondent the only reason that we we
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
held that over for interim study was
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
because if you take away the right of
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
removal that means those are going to be
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
staying at the Human Rights Commission
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
and where they had a backlog we just
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand what impact that
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
would have expand on a writer removal so
 
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.380 align:start position:0%
the right of removal is when you take
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
the case to the Human Rights Commission
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
the claimant has a choice as to where to
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
take the case they can go either to the
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
superior court or the Human Rights
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
Commission after 180 days the claimant
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
may choose to take the case and remove
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
it to the superior court but the
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
respondent after a finding of probable
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
cause can also remove the case to the
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
superior court and the reason that the
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill was brought for us was they said
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
look you you've spent all this time your
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
come to the the five yard line and then
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
you pull it to a different form it's
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
just not fair and that is why 48 other
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
states don't allow it and the Supreme
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
Court has struck it down for their
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
challenged here it would be struck down
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
as well so constitutionally we had no
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill I just wanted to
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of removing the
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
right of removal how it would impact the
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
workload at the Human Rights Commission
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
and that really was the major focus of
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
the interim study
 
00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.150 align:start position:0%
the interim study
committee

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
what we found was that there is a
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
significant backlog at the Human Rights
 
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
Commission the statutory requirement is
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
that you basically put through people
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
through the process and there's a
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
two-year statutory limit now for the 80
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the lifespan of the
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
commission that statutory limit was one
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
year but ten years ago there were cuts
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
to the resources at the commission and
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
so it was moved out to two years in
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
recognition of what those cuts were but
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony that not only are
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
we not meeting that two-year statutory
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
limit we're going out in cases to five
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
years you know and as chairman Gordon
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
the chair of our committee said Justice
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
delayed is Justice denied and so when we
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
got in the Human Rights Commission is
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
unique because there's a huge
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
investigatory arm and the pro process
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
really starts when an investigator is
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
assigned that's not happening on the
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission right now for 18
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
months so it it really is dragging out
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
they're out of place right now where the
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
they are docketing 25 new cases a month
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
and they're able to get through the 25
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
cases so it appears right now that
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're achieving a sort of steady state
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
but with a high turnover rate what
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
happens is they lose people and the
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
backlog goes up and the backlog right
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
now is at 300 cases okay and so that
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
backlog is really staying flat except
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
when they go through more turnover and
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
then it ratchets up it ratchets up it
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
never comes down see we have a motion on
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.930 align:start position:0%
a second
okay

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
all those in favor hi
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay Senator you didn't even want to
 
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.569 align:start position:0%
okay Senator you didn't even want to
hear

00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:46.579 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
did you want to add
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
wait work with the
 
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
wait work with the
right

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay Senator could
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
could I also ask
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
I know that we've got oplc and
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
certification as a tabled item
 
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
certification as a tabled item
and

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
hearing from
 
00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:13.699 align:start position:0%
what was just said about the Dental
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
examiner's Board
 
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.180 align:start position:0%
I I firmly believe that we need to
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
pursue that
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh but that's
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
concerned about the table the item for
 
00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
concerned about the table the item for
oplc

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
and you'll probably be able to get it
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
today you'll have it for a physical next
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
week and certainly be able to ask a lot
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
of questions at that meeting
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I think as uh Steve Smith said it
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
does cover
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of information a lot of the topics
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
between the board being born and the
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
oatmeal State and I think it will have a
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
lot of if there's 50 of the boards oh
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
right right the same I think you're
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
going to find the same issues throughout
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
the whole organization
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
if I might okay so what you're
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that at this time
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh we don't take this off the table
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
but rather I mean it'll looking at what
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
you've got going on
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
uh this probably wouldn't
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
be able to be audited until sometime
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
trying to address
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't find it I mean some of the
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
observations some of the recommendations
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
are you know will take longer than a
 
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
they have a bunch of things they're
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
going to have to work on to begin with
 
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:23.150 align:start position:0%
going to have to work on to begin with
um

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan as chair of this
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%

program evaluation society that you can
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
submit an audit report
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
qualifications in particular that the
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
audit report was a catalyst of change
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislative change things of that nature
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
so we thought the adult parole board was
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
a would be a good candidate and we've
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually how many years now three
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've submitted three reports
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
for this award
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
this one's the fourth
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
so um so just just making you aware that
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
we submitted it and they recognize it as
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
meeting all the the criteria so it's one
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
benefit or kudos to our staff who put in
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
all the labor and effort in these in
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
these things to be recognized at a
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
national level so
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
that comes to fiscal will it be Senator
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
Reagan will because it's coming from the
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee to to the fiscal committee
 
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.430 align:start position:0%

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I I think we should recognize the
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
senator for his years of service on this
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh on this committee and uh this is
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
probably one of the uh
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
least exciting committees did I say that
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
no I'm I guess suited to it because I
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
thought it was exciting oh okay
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
audits audits are never exciting when
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
they say I'm here to help
 
00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:39.710 align:start position:0%
they say I'm here to help
um

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think we all need to uh
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
recognize his dedication and uh and the
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
things that he's done for the committee
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
