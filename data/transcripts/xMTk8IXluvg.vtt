00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 align:start position:0%
there were some
Clarity<00:03:53.400><c> I</c><00:03:53.640><c> think</c><00:03:53.760><c> that</c><00:03:53.879><c> could</c><00:03:54.060><c> be</c><00:03:54.180><c> given</c><00:03:54.480><c> to</c>

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
Clarity I think that could be given to
 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.990 align:start position:0%
Clarity I think that could be given to
to<00:03:54.900><c> the</c><00:03:55.140><c> to</c><00:03:55.319><c> the</c><00:03:55.500><c> laws</c><00:03:55.799><c> as</c><00:03:55.860><c> I</c><00:03:56.040><c> recall</c><00:03:56.340><c> statute</c>

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the laws as I recall statute
 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330 align:start position:0%
to the to the laws as I recall statute
so<00:03:57.360><c> but</c><00:03:58.140><c> it's</c><00:03:58.319><c> really</c><00:03:58.500><c> up</c><00:03:58.739><c> to</c><00:03:58.860><c> the</c><00:03:58.980><c> legislature</c>

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.410 align:start position:0%
so but it's really up to the legislature
how<00:03:59.519><c> they</c><00:03:59.700><c> want</c><00:03:59.879><c> it</c><00:04:00.060><c> to</c><00:04:00.239><c> to</c><00:04:00.659><c> handle</c><00:04:01.019><c> it</c><00:04:01.140><c> so</c>

but with a high turnover rate what
 

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:14.210 align:start position:0%
but with a high turnover rate what
