00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh the time being
 
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
10:00 a.m. I'd like to welcome everyone
 
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
to the special committee on covid
 
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
response efficacy and I'd like to ask
 
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative poof to lead us in the
 
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:35.749 align:start position:0%
representative poof to lead us in the
pledge

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like to remind everyone that this is
 
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan committee tasked with
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
investigating and evaluating the state's
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
response to the covid-19 pandemic the
 
00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
committee will function in a
 
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
science-based fact finding review
 
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
specifically acquiring comprehensive
 
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
accurate data and all related
 
00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
information pertaining ther to areas of
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
particular Focus will include the
 
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
administration of federal guidance
 
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
acceptance of federal funds and
 
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of emergency use
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
authorization vaccination efforts a
 
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
report will be issued outlining the
 
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 align:start position:0%
committee's findings and the impact on
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this morning we have
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh Dr Jordan vaugh uh here um and I
 
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
would like to welcome Dr vau uh and
 
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
would you tell us a little bit about
 
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
yourself where you're from and uh
 
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 align:start position:0%
anything else you would like to say yeah
 
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
my my name is Jordan I'm actually a uh
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
an internist uh that practices in
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
Birmingham Alabama uh I am trained as a
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
engineer previously my undergrad is in
 
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
engineering and then after that went to
 
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
med school at University of Alabama
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
Birmingham and then actually did my
 
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
residency there I am Additionally the
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
son of a physician who was also a
 
00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 align:start position:0%
general practitioner I am uniquely a
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
private practitioner somebody that
 
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
actually uh basically has his own
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
organization and is responsible for
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
about 200 employees uh we uh take care
 
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
of about
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
150,000 patient visits a year and that
 
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
was some of the unique aspects of what
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh I'm kind of tasked with learning a
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
little about was how to take care of not
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
only my employees in this you know the
 
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
last four years but also how to make
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
sure that my patients whether healthy or
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
with chronic conditions were also taken
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
care of and so that's a lot of where my
 
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
expertise came from was just really
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
Solutions um
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
does anyone on the committee have any
 
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
questions for Dr vau or um well I have
 
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
one um and just chatting with you this
 
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
morning um you were letting me know that
 
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh you were being contacted by a
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
physician in New Hampshire yes um and so
 
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
your practice and you personally help
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
people across the country is that
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct so um throughout
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
this I actually kind of acquired a
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
special looking at Co Associated
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
coagulopathy and microvascular disease
 
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 align:start position:0%
so what we do know about the spike
 
00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
protein is that it is uh highly
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
coagulopathic uh that it causes uh
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
fibrin to form in abnormal ways that are
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
harder to break down so imagine that
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
fibron is kind of like a spaghetti that
 
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
just came out of the colander that you
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
can kind of break apart it's involved in
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
you making clots uh but the spike
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
protein is able to make uh fibrin more
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
of like a burnt spaghetti casserole that
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's stuck to the bottom of a
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
casserole dish that requires a brillopad
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
to get rid of and so in many ways
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
working with some folks in South Africa
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
as well as uh University of Liverpool in
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
England we have kind of a Consortium of
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the concept of
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
microvascular coagulation issues in
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
covid and vaccine injury and so uniquely
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
obviously the vaccine produces Spike
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
protein and Spike protein can do this
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
independent of thren thren is usually
 
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
what's required to make clots uh
 
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
additionally the damage to the inside of
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
the vessels which is what we call the
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
endothelium uh causes uh a lot of damage
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
too so you can get a lot of
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
microvascular issues that don't
 
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily show up in a typical
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
cardiological exam or somebody that's
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
being treated for coronary disease so in
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways what I treat is getting a
 
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
lot of these young a lot of my patients
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
are very young athletic people
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
historically that after either covid or
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
the vaccine now we're almost to the
 
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
point that they're bedbound and a lot of
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
getting those kids back to normal has
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
been how do we heal the vasculature back
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
to the level that the vasculature is
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
working properly so uh the cardiologist
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
that reached out this week uh is is from
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but i' had been taking
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
care of a patient that had come down and
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
and been evaluated and treated and he
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
was just interested that he had gotten
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
better and he had another patient that
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
very similar that he wanted to kind of
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
have a talk with
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
about uh great uh representative
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
wary yes thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr B for taking my question
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
um is this related to the myoc cardio
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
effects that we're seeing in young male
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
population right now um we we've seen
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
where you know anecdotally there are
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
people who are uh Keeling over on
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
athletic fields we're also seeing
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
situations where um they've now
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
recognized this as a formal side effect
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
in a large population that's received
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is this related to those
 
00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
incidents it is specific Al uh there's
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
most recent um Journal looking at the uh
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries in myocarditis and they
 
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
compared it to a cohort of adolescent
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
males males from the age of 15 to 17 and
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the Mardis only
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
myocarditis only occurred in those that
 
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
receive the vaccine so the V it seems
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
myocardial dysfunction uh definitely is
 
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
more related to probably the product
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
itself than actually Co but Co because
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
of the spike protein um also uh is just
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
I've got probably 15% of my patients
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
that are debilitated that never had the
 
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.350 align:start position:0%
that are debilitated that never had the
vaccine

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
either followup so is is do you suspect
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
that because there's a transmissibility
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
between with the spike protein vaccine
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
or we don't really know but I will say
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
that the spike protein itself regardless
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
of its source is is damaging to the
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
vessels and and causes coagulation
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
issues and people the other thing that
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
we've kind of looked at is a lot of
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
these people already had some
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
predispositions for clotting but those
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
predispositions were nothing they knew
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
about until after the fact and so again
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we've kind of
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
realized is there are people that are
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
more prone to injury but those aren't
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
things that we would have never probably
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
never investigated previously and so
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
then we find that out afterwards it's
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
nice to know it but it doesn't change
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've got to get them
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
better represent
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
you Dr V for being here um so I
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
guess my my question is I'm not even
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
sure if you can answer this but if if
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
the spike protein is perhaps cardiotoxic
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly toxic to vascular material
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
um is this something that could or
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
should have been known prior to using
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
the spike protein to develop the
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines on yeah that was you know let
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
me go through a little bit of my
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
testimony in that regard but kind of
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
just starting from that but what I would
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
tell you I'm again outpatient clinician
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
2020 presented kind of a broad set of
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
challenges given the fact that I've got
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
to take care of both my employees and
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
then 150,000 patients that kind of seek
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
my uh business for care uh but as I kind
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
of went into the literature and tried to
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
find the best understanding of of SARS
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
Cove 2 the spike protein as well what
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
really emerged was the spike protein was
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
all of the above it was amuno toxic
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
cytotoxic coagulopathic and
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately also amalog genic and so
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to me in one of the
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
big things that I had an issue with when
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
the vaccine was brought into the
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
Forefront uh a little unknown to me as
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
my patients who I are already knew
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
started showing up with shortness of
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
breath or other kind of side effects
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
following the vaccine then they would
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
also have abnormal clotting uh issues
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
like d diers that were elevated and but
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
at the same time I wouldn't see anything
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
when I would get Imaging to find out if
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
they had big p pulmonary embolisms or
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
anything like that uh but I would treat
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
them as if they did and they would
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
improve and that kind of led me down the
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
pathway trying to understand the
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
coagulation aspects of that Spike
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
protein but the truth is we did the
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
spike protein itself we know has been
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
coagulopathic and then in addition if we
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
didn't know by the time that the vaccine
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
was rolled out uh we would know then I
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
mean basically when we look at back at
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
March 2020 the the people that I work
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
with in South Africa one of them named
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
jao lober who's a cardiac intensivist
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
South Africa he actually released a
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
video back in June of 2020 that
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
basically said we're barking up the
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
wrong tree this is not respiratory
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
disease per se it's a vascular disease
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's where it's causing the damage and
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
that's really why a lot of times even
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
putting people on ventilators was the
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
exact opposite of what we would want to
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
do if you have a pulmonary vascular
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
issue limiting the blood flow to the
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
lungs causing lower oxygen levels the
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
worst thing you can usually do is
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
increase the intrathoracic pressure and
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
close down more vessels so a lot of what
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
I did in acute covid was basically
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
getting patients uh diagnosed treated
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
with early treatment and also getting
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
them on things like anticoagulation and
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
antiplatelets getting them on home
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
oxygen and then for the most part
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
getting them better I actually had to
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
kind of develop my own uh what I would
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
call oxygen Angel one of the patients
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
that I had treated uh her husband uh we
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
had pulled him out of the hospital uh
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
and put him on home oxygen got him on
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants and then she started to
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
say you know it's kind of hard to get
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
oxygen and so I we came up with the idea
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
of her kind of traveling around to all
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
these patients that might need it after
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
they had seen me and she delivered the
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
home oxygen to them and we were able to
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually treat about 500 patients in the
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
outpatient setting without actually
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
having them admitted to the hospital and
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
better represent po
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
off thank you uh thank you for your
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
testimony could you clarify what's the
 
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
difference between uh home oxygen and
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
putting on ventilator so yeah so a
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
ventilator so when we breathe for the
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
most part it's it's a negative pressure
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
meaning like your diaphragm basically
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
contracts it creates a negative pressure
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and you bring air into your lungs okay
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh when you're on a ventilator that's
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
what we call positive pressure
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
ventilation you're basically forcing
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
more air increasing the intrathoracic
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
pressure problem with that is that's not
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
how we're designed to breathe and if you
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
do that for long you damage the lungs
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
regardless if that makes sense and so uh
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
if you can the what we were able to do
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
was make sure they had adequate
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
additional oxygen without limiting the
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
continued availability of the of the
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
vasculature that actually was still
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
useful and so basically again home
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
oxygen was putting them nasal canel or
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
high flow where they were still
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
utilizing their diaphragm to bring air
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
in and out not having air punched into
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
their lungs like you would in an
 
00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:20.389 align:start position:0%
their lungs like you would in an
ICU

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
ICU
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
followup uh you also mentioned uh four
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
properties uh known properties of Spike
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
protein immunotoxic
 
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.710 align:start position:0%
protein immunotoxic
cytotoxic

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
cytotoxic
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
coagulopathic could you repeat the forse
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
property and what it means
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
amenic so that means that the spike
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
protein itself can confer other proteins
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
to abnormally turn in to different
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
shapes we call amidogen I mean the kind
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
of classic disease we typically think
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
about is a Pyon disease like uh you know
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
cjd but basically it's an interesting
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we find in medicine that a
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
certain confirmation of a protein can
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
cause other proteins to conf form to it
 
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
and without another what we would call
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
enzymatic activity and that's a very
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing we don't like that
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's actually when you think about
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
amalo agenic you're thinking about all
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
the diseases you don't want uh when you
 
00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:12.829 align:start position:0%
the diseases you don't want uh when you
get

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
older representative
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
vure thank you madam chair um and just
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
to follow up a little bit on the the
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
topic of ventilation I'm no physician
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
but I do have a little bit of a
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
background in healthcare um from my time
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
as a paramedic I was aware that we
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
typically try not to intubate and
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
ventilate if we don't have to because it
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
can be damaging it seemed to me at the
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
time early covid that the rather
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
aggressive um use of
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
ventilation was
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
abnormal throughout our investigation as
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
a committee we have seemed to find that
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
the source of these protocols may have
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
been through the W Health Organization
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
coming down from the who to the uh CDC
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
and IH and and from there do you have
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
any information about where these
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
ventilator protocols came from and
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
whether you found them strange most of
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
them I felt like came from Health and
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services in the NIH and but I will
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
say that no one's name was attached nor
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
were there any documents supporting such
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
things and in fact most of the hospitals
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
would tell you even the protocol for
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
treatment might have even come from the
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
cares act a legislative document that
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
was passed in what was actually
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for care based on uh you know
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
how people were treated and that's an
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to find in its own
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
right uh the other thing early on I
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
think some of again going back to
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
something we talked you know have talked
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
about it is fear uh there was fear that
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
if you could intubate the patient that
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
you could close the the loop and
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
actually not have exposure to other
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
people in the hospital to actually
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
getting covid now that's kind of a full
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
hearty thing in itself but I think some
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
of some of the people that was more you
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
know initially when you talk to ICU
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
doctors that was some of their thinking
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
was hey this person has active covid to
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
keep them alive let's close the the
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
respiratory Loop to make sure that it's
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
not exposing other patients now was that
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the correct thing to do again we could
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
debate that but I think that there was
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
some fear around it if I'm going to take
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
care of that patient I don't I want them
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
on a different breathing Loop than my
 
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
on a different breathing Loop than my
Loop

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering about the
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
timeline here um when did you discover
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
because covid we all know that the
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
shutdown happened in 2020 March of 2020
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
um was when we started seeing an
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
increase in cases in the US uh New
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shutdown uh just before St
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
Patty's Day
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
um so when we're talking about the incu
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh ventil ventilators when were you
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
aware that that was not a proper use um
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and how did you find that out I guess is
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
my my question and why why wasn't that
 
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
my my question and why why wasn't that
knowledge

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
widespread so it was by that summer we
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
understood so summer of 2020 uh the you
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
know again the one of the great things
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
that NIH and National libraries of
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
medicine have done is make it available
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
to read what the rest of the world is is
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
doing okay and so if you were actually
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
diving into the literature and seeing
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
what South Africa was doing what Italy
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
was doing what England was doing you
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
were able to see that people were trying
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
different things and they had different
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
results and when those results were
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
positive and and counter to what you
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
were told that was when you started
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
going hm there must be something here so
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
it it was about that summer that most
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
people realized that the ventilators
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
were at at even at best a salvage uh and
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the correct way to treat
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
things and you know again I would say I
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
I I kind of lawed jao lobster a cardiac
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
intensivist very independent person in
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
stellin Bosch uh University of South
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
Africa uh who basically said look we
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
need to stop putting people on
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
ventilators the problem was by that time
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
the the legislation that the government
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
had put out had kind of codified
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
treatment as well as payment for
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
treatment and that actually probably
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
changed the incentive structures for
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of patients in the hospital
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
so let me understand this correctly so
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that the the
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge out there that ventilators
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
were not the way to go um because this
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
was not not really a respiratory issue
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
well yeah it affects the lungs but it
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the airway of the lungs
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
right the airway of the lungs okay uh in
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
summer of
 
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.669 align:start position:0%
summer of
2020

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
but legislation and the way people were
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
paid for treatment meant that they still
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
had to follow a protocol that was
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually doing
 
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
actually doing
harm

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so my I guess my question is is we
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
have doctors in hospitals that have
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
access to the information on what's
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
working what's not working the same as
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
you did but are
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
choosing um to follow a
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
protocol because of um non-medical
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
dollars most likely I I don't question
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
that the doctors were trying to do the
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
best that they could and based on the
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
protocol that's what they were trying to
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
do I don't think sometimes as a
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
physician um you have the flexibility or
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of Physicians don't even have the
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
Curiosity anymore to think that maybe
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
what they're what they're doing since
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's not working may not be the right
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
thing and so that is it is true I mean I
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
I think what I had found and um even at
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
my state level uh was at had to meet
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
with the board with was that I would
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
pull somebody out of the hospital well
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
first of all the patient themselves was
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
not even really visited by The Physician
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
they were visited on the phone uh they
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
were chastised they were basically put
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
in isolation and so to me made no no
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
sense for even if he was going to pass
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
away why were we doing it under the
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
conditions of him being in solitary
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
confinement so instead my my knowledge
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
base as well as understanding of the
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
disease process gave me the freedom as
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
well as the knowledge base to say no
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
let's do something different and when we
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
started doing something different it
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
worked and that's again what Shaka was
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
doing in South Africa they started doing
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
in a lot of other places where they had
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
realized that ventilators were not the
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
solution represent
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair um so what
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
you've just suggested to us regarding
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
the codification of care within the
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
cares act really tracks with some of the
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
other information we've received and
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
some of the other bigger Trends we've
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
seen especially with things like the
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
longstanding uh delegated authority of
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
Physicians to prescribe off label that
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
was suddenly removed for a number of
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
medications during the pandemic period
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question would
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
be do you believe that there was amongst
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
all the fear of the pandemic an effort
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
to Central plan health care that
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately had you know detrimental
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
effects you yeah I I definitely think
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
the deferral to your octogenarian in
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Washington who hadn't treated a patient
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
in 30 years was probably not the best
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
way to treat a new disease process uh
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I definitely think also that uh most
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the time in medicine and this is
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
probably more of probably more of a
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
historical view but most of the time uh
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
very little is uh is discovered within
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
the confines of the Ivory Towers they're
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
very good at improving technical
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
expertise safety the ability to do
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
things but when a new disease or
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
something like that comes along it
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
usually is somebody outside the system
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
that figures out that the the way to
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
treat it because again usually a new
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
disease or a new process requires a
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
rethinking of how we have treated
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
past

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to wrap my head around all
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
of this because I'm not being in the
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
so do I know you're an internist so I'm
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
just going to throw this out there um we
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
heard testimony in our committee about
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
masking um
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
and are you seeing within your patients
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
any detrimental effects from people
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
being forced to wear masks or um and the
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
other question would be is um we also
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
want understand that the virus was I
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
forget what it was
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
05 Micron so that even those cloth mask
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
it could uh penetrate through uh so they
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
really weren't stopping the transmission
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
or the receiving of covid is my
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
understanding if I'm wrong please
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
correct me um do you know when we knew
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
about that uh
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
science yeah you know it was actually uh
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there was a a study done in a
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
hospital setting uh assessing surgical
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
mask and n95 mask on the flu and
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
actually this was published in I think
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
the New England Journal I have to I'll
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
have to give it to you at the end of
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
this but what they found is there was no
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
difference and then that actually was a
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up study to something they had
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
done two years before looking at whether
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
surgical Mass changed the the Dynamics
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
of a flu in a hospital and again you
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about uh probably the
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
best case scenario for running a study
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
like that having healthcare workers wear
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
a mask properly wear it in that context
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
and again both both studies showed no
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
effect and so that was really again what
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
was so contrary to what was just
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
published six months before the outbreak
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
that it you know all of a sudden was
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
well this is this is the way to go and
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
even in in Tony F's emails when you look
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
at them now he was he was commenting on
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
it before he changed his mind that based
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the data that we had the data that we
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
had years and years and years of of of
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
information now it's hard to do a mask
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
study and I would actually argue that
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably most MTH Studies have plenty of
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know plenty of confounders plenty of
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
fallacies I mean it's it's just very
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
very hard to do a behavioral study like
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
that so uh since then there's been
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
studies on both sides uh but it's again
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think the common knowledge was exactly
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you madam
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair and continuing on that same sort
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
of line of thought around masking we've
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
heard from our Public Health officials
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they pursued what they call a Swiss
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
cheese approach to trying to mitigate
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
the spread of the virus and I think what
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
they mean by that is Swiss cheese has
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
holes in it but if you stack enough
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
layers of Swiss cheese you can cover all
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
the holes up so I'm wondering do you
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually do you find that to be an
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate analogy to those kind of
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
Public Health um
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
policies such that when you stack
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
masking and social distancing and these
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
other things together they necessarily
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
have an additive effect rather than a
 
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.870 align:start position:0%
have an additive effect rather than a
something

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
else um I don't think we know I think
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
your intuition would say maybe but
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in medicine as well as
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
science intuition is is not always the
 
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.510 align:start position:0%
science intuition is is not always the
answer

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative weary thank you madam
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you Dr Bon
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to go back a little bit to
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
the um incidence of
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
the what you're seeing in the
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
coagulation aspects and we've heard
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that um Funeral Home
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
directors and autopsy results have found
 
00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:26.389 align:start position:0%
directors and autopsy results have found
in

00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
um in in looking at people who have
 
00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:32.110 align:start position:0%
um in in looking at people who have
passed

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
away um that there's an
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
unusual clotting and coagulation that's
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
going on in those individuals is do you
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
have any uh knowledge or you know how
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
does it and does this relate if so does
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
this relate to what you were talking
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
about in terms of the coagulation
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
effects that you're seeing so the quick
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
answer is you know obviously in my world
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's a living tissue um it is
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
interesting and I've actually talked
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
with some of these uh some of the
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
funeral directors and actually in my lab
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
have I have not actually done my
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
specimen analysis of them but uh one of
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
the things we're trying to figure out is
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
what what is the cont content of them
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
because the content uh would be very
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
helpful you know does it have a lot of
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
the same properties of the clotting that
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing at the microscopic level so
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
the micr clotting level um but it it
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
would it it it is the same kind of thing
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing in the living in terms
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
of these you know vascular and
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
coagulation abnormalities and then the
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
way the clot is formed in these people
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
is very different than what we had
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
normally seen so when you compare it to
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
something that's not related to covid a
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
clot or uh you know a thrombus these
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
thrombus are much harder to break down
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind followup
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh could you could you expand on the
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
different in kind what what do you mean
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
by that that's interesting so I mean a
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
lot of it has to do with that the
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
protein level how proteins come together
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so in in truth our bodies designed
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
to basically clot when it needs to clot
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
but when it's done clotting or actually
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
those vessels need to be opened up those
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
things need to be able to be broken down
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
fairly easily we call that fibrinolysis
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
the ability to break down fibron or um
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
and so what we found is that the spike
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
protein uh causes confirmation of the
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
fibron into a way that's resistant to
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
fibron alyis so the body is not able to
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
break it down and especially in people
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
that already have some genetic
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
predisposition to fibrinolytic issues
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
meaning they don't break stuff down to
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
begin with it's kind of a cumulative
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
effect that even compounds so all of a
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
sudden these people are having uh you
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
know dvts pulmonary embolisms uh you
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
know coronary uh thromboses
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
Strokes uh all of those kind of things
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
and all of those the incidence of all of
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
those is on the rise uh and you know
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
again you could make some arguments
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
again that's just a correlation but the
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know just in our research it
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a pretty good and
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
it's starting to even come out in the
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
literature that postco and again most of
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
the time now most of the research is
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
postco uh which usually for a huge
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
percent of the population would be
 
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.630 align:start position:0%
percent of the population would be
postco

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
postco
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
postvaccine that uh the incidents and
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
issues that are associated with coronary
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
disease heart failure those kind of
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
things are are are changing in a
 
00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:41.430 align:start position:0%
things are are are changing in a
negative

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
way represent
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and again
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
to stay on the same line of thought
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
regarding um clotting which is very
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
interesting to me um I don't know the
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
linkage between what what was talked
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
about with the cavers versus um this
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
micr clotting you're talking about um
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
but I always have been a bit of a
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
natural skeptic and if I hadn't been one
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
of those people who was in the immediate
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
aftermath of vaccination I had a whole
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
host of health problems a lot of issues
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
I deteriorated for a period of several
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
weeks before I was ultimately
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
hospitalized for almost a week and after
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
taking my blood the very first thing
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
they did to me was Shoot Me Up full of
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hein yep because I was having abnormal
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
clotting um only time in my entire life
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
I have ever had a blood test demonstrate
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
abnormal clotting so my question would
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
be do you know how
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
common that phenomenon of coagulopathy
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
was either both uh postvaccination and
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
postco um within the population so the
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about the studies is
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
basically we know that everyone that
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
gets vaccinated or has covid exposure to
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
the spike protein is going to make this
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
abnormal fibron and that is
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
bad the question is who can get rid of
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
it and how much do you make and those
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
really determine the what I would call
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
the the symptoms and the downstream
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
effects of whether being vaccinated or
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
having covid so again going back to this
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
vasc you know barking up the wrong tree
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a respiratory disease it's a
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
vascular disease it's a vascular
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that's basically what you're
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
provoking and so again what we have
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
found and are still trying to find is
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
what actually makes a person more
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
susceptible to this but in my uh my
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
research as well as my uh you know
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
taking care of these patients the less
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
better uh representative
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
wary as just to follow up on on that um
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
with with that abnormal clotting uh and
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about this before
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
the meeting formally began but what what
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
sort of treatments as an internist uh
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
treating your patients what sort of
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
treatments are you looking at to
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
counteract this abnormal clotting that
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're seeing so early on in the um
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
early on in the pandemic or in basically
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
the outbreak in the spring of 2020 one
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that was interesting if
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
you looked at uh the data of people that
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
were hospitalized and people that
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually left the hospital after being
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
hospitalized is there was from
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
especially some of the New York
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I'll get you the paper
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
about it was twice as likely that you
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
were to leave the hospital alive and
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
again these were mainly older people at
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
the time uh if you were on a blood
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
thinner well people that are on blood
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
thinners from a morbidity standpoint
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
aren't healthier than people that aren't
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
so why is there a selective advantage to
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
them being on blood thinners and it was
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually that was probably some of the
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
first suggestion that there's something
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
here and so um the uh you know when we
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
think about uh how we have treated acute
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
covid and that was under the you know
 
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:16.039 align:start position:0%
really the the science of of jao lobster
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
as a cardiac intensivist working with
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
Risha ptus who's uh who's taught me how
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
to utilize uh immunofluorescent
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
microscopy and look at blood um they
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
were able to look at patients in the
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
hospital in the you know cardiac
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
Intensive Care Unit and find that they
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
all had these amalo uh fibron findings
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
and they were able to see after they put
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
them on anticoagulation and antiplatelet
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
therapy that those things got better but
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
so did the patient does that make sense
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
so that was the first clue that
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
treatment with that was effective
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
now um move that forward as patients
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
started to show up in the offices of jao
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
lober and me who had survived survived
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
covid or had some typee of vaccine
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
injury uh and were complaining of
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
similar symptoms not to the you know not
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they needed to be
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
hospitalized but when we looked at their
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
blood they had similar findings to what
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
Jaa was seeing in the CCU uh and so it
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
made kind of intuitive sense to say hey
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
if the treatment worked for these people
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
can it work for the patients that are in
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
the outpatient setting and so that was
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
our first kind of move into it and so
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
jao published a uh you know a case load
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
of probably about 60 patients that he
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
tried antiplatelet and anticoagulant
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
therapy on and between us I've probably
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
treated 2500 patients now uh with a dual
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
antiplatelet and anti coagulant therapy
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and had a really you know probably
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
success in the 70% in terms of returning
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
to normal status now everyone's
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
different not every bit of long Co or
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
even how Co attacks the body is all
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
vascular the immune system is still
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
involved a lot so there's lots of
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
autoimmune things that can go on but the
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
thing that we have learned is that you
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
can't disambiguate or disentangle the
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
inflammatory system from the coagulation
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
system in fact what we call it is
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
thrombo inflammation you'll probably the
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
next 10 years in medicine you'll hear
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
that word a lot because thrombo
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
inflammation especially of the
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
microvasculature is responsible for a
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
lot of other diseases that we talk about
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
like dementia like you know different
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know cor coronary microvascular
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
disease other things like that that we
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
usually associate with chronic diseases
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
that get you into the nursing home which
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
in some ways might be a silver lining of
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
this whole craziness is that we are
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
starting to understand the
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
microvasculature better I usually use
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
the metaphor that imagine that you're
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
sitting in your shower at home and
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
nothing's coming out of your shower head
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
and you call a plumber
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
and the plumber shows up and actually
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
digs up your water man in your front
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
yard and tells you there's nothing wrong
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
well you'd probably fire that plumber
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
well the problem is is medicine is still
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
out in the yard digging up your water
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
man when the issues are inside the house
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so in that sense that's where we're
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
going is understanding how to actually
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
help the small vessels because the big
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
salt I have a question for you
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
um you treat a lot of patients uh
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to make a blanket
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
statement um I'm going to say that most
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has either had covid or been
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and some
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
both um are you seeing a difference
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
between those that were vaccinated and
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
those that just had covid and um are you
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
seeing more uh people uh going to
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
that have had the covid shot versus
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
those that have just had covid are you
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
seeing differences so there they have on
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
the coagulation part they are very
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
similar I would say um not you know but
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
when we talk about things like heart
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
failure neurological issues autoimmune
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
issues again we take care of all those
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
too it seems that the people that have
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated are the ones that more
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
likely have those issues than the person
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
that just had covid and wasn't
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that has much more primary
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
microvascular disease that you know is
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
more easily treatable does that make
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
sense so it's but that again is just
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
again an observation of my patient
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
cohort even though it's large it's still
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's it uh it encompasses a a
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
certain subset of people so people that
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
are seeking treatment people that are um
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that recognize that something's
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
wrong so I will tell you historically
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know again as I was treating covid
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
as you know pulling people out of the
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
hospital getting them on home oxygen
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
keeping them alive the world talks and
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot people just started
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
showing up after they had been
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
hospitalized and hadn't gotten better
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that's when we started instituting a
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
lot of what what Jaa was already
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
researching in South Africa to say let's
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
try this and see if we can get you
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
better from postco issues uh the other
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
thing was a lot of these people were
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
very young and so they had this kind of
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
oh there is a marked change between how
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
I was before or after Co or before or
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
after the shot there are a lot of people
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
in their 60s and 70s that it's much
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
easier for them or their Physicians to
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
rationalize that they are just getting
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
older or or they are just missing a step
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
and the reality is there's a lot more of
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
that than I think there we we admit and
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
when we actually Institute treatments in
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
some of these people the outcomes are
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to too getting back to
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
being able to think not having to go to
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living those kind of things so
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a huge again we're
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
talking about about 200 people but uh
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's fascinating to see that the
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
answer isn't always you're just old and
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh out of
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
shape um so I had a uh somebody that
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
talked to me that was vaccinated I
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe she went for her second vaccine
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then it uh an autoimmune response
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
happened in her body so that she
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take any more of the uh shots
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
um so what you're saying is that Co the
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
co shot could actually trigger those
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
autoimmune and because she had
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
attributed to the shot itself yeah and
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
that is a real yeah and again I you know
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not unique to any vaccination
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know our immune systems as I
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
think we were talking even before this
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
started is our immune systems are
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex I would actually
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
argue that Immunology is kind of one of
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
the last bastions of medicine the more I
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of compare it to a a hall that we
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
think we'll we'll get past this next
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
door and we'll actually know everything
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
and we get to the next door and open it
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
up and the room's bigger than the room
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
before uh you know the more complexity
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
there is uh it just the more we're able
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
to get deeper the more complex it
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
becomes and so anytime we poke the bear
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
imagine that you're immune system is a
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
bear you know you want it to Roar when
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
you need it to but when you poke it
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriately it often Ro it often
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
Roars and causes dysfunction in the
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
immune system uh the other thing is a
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
lot of these people were vaccinated that
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
already had dysfunctional immune systems
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
and the worst thing you can do is poke a
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
awake um now I know uh some folks that
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
are still continuing I mean obviously it
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
seems like the covid shot is now like
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
the flu shot um it's becoming seasonal
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
in you know that's how I'm perceiving it
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
um and people are getting five six
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
um and they think that they're fine and
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's no side effects um and other
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
people you know stop after two as I said
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
because of that and then I've known
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
people that uh have had massary
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
coronaries and died uh within 48 Hours
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the shot um so it runs the gamut um
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know we H have a campaign that says
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh that that shot is safe and
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
effective um so knowing that for some
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
people it probably is maybe safe and
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
effective um and for others it's deadly
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
um that's what I'm I've seen across the
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
Gambit and and just the the small amount
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
of people that I see you've seen a lot
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
more people
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um what is your opinion of this shot
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
this covid shot and why is it safe and
 
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.470 align:start position:0%
this covid shot and why is it safe and
effective

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it when we say safe and
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
effective I think it that's because they
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
say it is um it is not necessarily that
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
the science BS that out uh again the
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
original Placebo controlled trial uh has
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
not borne out what it actually said it
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
would do and all of the other data has
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
been what we call OB you know it's
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
really post talk it's observational
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
meaning it's it's happened after the
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
fact and you can you know when we talk
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
about standards of you know evaluating
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
something in a randomized you know
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
controlled randomized Placebo control
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
trial that data doesn't seem to have
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
borne out that 95% efficacy rate that
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
they quoted uh I I would probably agree
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
that everybody in here knows that that
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
is not true um but again you know trials
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
are not the exact same thing as uh as
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
what happens in the real world but when
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's that big a discrepancy usually a
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
product starts being questioned and I
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
think that's that's that's the thing
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
that I think the public health uh world
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
has had to deal with is that most people
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
now know that what they've been told
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
especially the word effective is not uh
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
is not true so even if they believe it
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
is safe I don't find many people that
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
find it effective at least effective
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond a month or two but even that is
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
is uh is an issue uh safety is also the
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
other thing is it's hard to uh look at
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
the data the data in the uh you know V's
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
database is
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly different than any other
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine we've ever actually pushed on
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
people or brought into the marketplace
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh now there's plenty of ways to
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
rationalize why that is and that's what
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
you get from the public health officials
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
of course they like the data when it
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
shows there's no complaints they hate
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
the data when it shows there's a ton you
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
know they use it they use it for them
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
when it's in their favor they use it
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
against you know when it's not uh but
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing you're bringing up and
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
what a lot of our research has shown is
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
that the people that have um underlying
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
issues that make that vaccine dangerous
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
for them uh it it's not something that
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
we most Physicians or even I know
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what to test before you would
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
even give that vaccine and so that makes
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
it where you know if it's safe and and
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
effective uh but there's a certain
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
subset of people that shouldn't get it
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
we should know that before we tell
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to get it we should actually
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
have a a warning saying people that you
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
know have sensitivity to this or have a
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
coagulation issue they should avoid the
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine the other thing is is vaccines
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
are not all created equal and so there
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
are different types of vaccines and I
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
actually that is one of the things
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's bothered me the most is they
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
wrapped this vac they wrapped this new
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
injection technology in the word vaccine
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
and vaccines are different in terms of
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms in which they elicit the
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
immune system and a lot of the
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
historical vaccines that we have are
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
passive and passive meaning your body
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
interfaces with a foreign antigen and
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
your body makes an immune response this
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
is the first vaccine that we have that's
 
00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:14.270 align:start position:0%
is the first vaccine that we have that's
been

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
marketed that actually utilizes your
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
cell to make a foreign pathogen and in
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
that case it is a completely different
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh we have never uh co-opted the
 
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh we have never uh co-opted the
cell

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
cell
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
to make foreign proteins instead we have
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
exposed the body to foreign proteins to
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
make immune responses I will say the one
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine that is probably the lowest in
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
terms of side effects and uh and and
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events is the Nova vac
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
the novavax is a passive protein subunit
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine it is interesting that our
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
government has done nothing to promote
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
that as a safer alternative to uh to the
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
MRNA injections but uh there again
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's many reasons that I could
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
postulate why but uh I will tell you
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
that the novax is probably the only
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
thing that I would ever even consider
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
getting represent
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
you again for being here to answer all
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
these questions um so where the covid
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy not I'm sorry covid
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
response efficacy
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee um so we're looking at
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
efficacy or the effectiveness of the
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
government actions the very first
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
question we ask ourselves when we're
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
trying to determine efficacy is what was
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
the point what e you know efficacious at
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
what so there's been two justifications
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
offered for the um recommendation of
 
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
offered for the um recommendation of
these

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines the first justification which I
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
think has been pretty
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
thoroughly blown out of the water at
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
this point both by your testimony our
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
state epidemiologist testimony and
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
others was that these vaccines will um
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of covid uh obviously
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's not correct everybody's got covid
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not the other
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
justification that was offered was that
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um effectively reduces
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
morbidity and mortality to covid-19
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
infection so my question is how do you
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
feel about that second justification is
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
it correct across all the demographics
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
for which we recommend it and if not is
 
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:39.559 align:start position:0%
it correct for any
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
demographic well I would say in the
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
original trial that was not an endpoint
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
that they actually it was not a primary
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
endpoint so to after the fact come up
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
with a new prior end primary endpoint
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
the FDA usually requires you to do
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
another trial um instead of just
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that it's true from post Hawker
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
observational data and that has not been
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
done so again they can argue that all
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
they want with data that they may
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
accumulate among again you know cohorts
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
of patients within Health Systems but
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
the actual data doesn't bore that out
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
tested we heard in this committee that
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
there were two trials being done and I
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
forget the groups I think um one was the
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
FDA and I'm not sure if the other one
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
was the CDC or not um but we also saw
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh the data wasn't
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
panning out the way they had hoped on
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
one of the trials and so they opted to
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
change over to the other trial so
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
instead of having two separate data
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
points and two SE separate trials they
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
both conducted the same trial to get to
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
the in
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
so that it wouldn't show negative yeah
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
um did you hear anything about that or
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
see anything regarding those trials or
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
um there there's some suggestions as
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
well as legal filings that there was
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
some fraudulent stuff I don't you know I
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
can't really comment on that knowing um
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't have all the information
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
but um it is not that
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
uncommon uh in this world that uh again
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical trials are an interesting
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
Endeavor and they're going to want the
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
outcome to a lot of times be what they
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
want it to be and I hate to say that but
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
when we classically think of who gets
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know again looking at the original
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine trial that that fizer did you
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
know 40,000 patients 20,000 getting in
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
an intervention 20,000 not uh you know
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the intervention trial had you know
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
five cardiovascular events resulting in
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
death versus the placebo had
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
one uh now they said that those people
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
had heart attacks for other reasons uh
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't one of the things that
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
they were evaluating it wasn't
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
statistically significant but to me that
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
is significant when you only have a
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
certain number of deaths anyway the
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
other thing is you got to realize as
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in that
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
40,000 uh person trial you're talking
 
00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:18.349 align:start position:0%
40,000 uh person trial you're talking
about

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:18.359 --> 00:49:19.950 align:start position:0%
about
200

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
218 something you'll have to have to
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
look it up but it it's a little bit over
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
200 cases of Co and that's how they came
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
up with that number of
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
95% uh that seems like a fairly
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
small uh uh you know subset of people
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
actually getting covid and the you know
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be interest if they did just let's
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
say if they did the trial right now I
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be quite different does
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
that make
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
sense representative
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and switch
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
topic a little bit same vaccine topic
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
but a little bit of a different era
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I have heard and I believe other
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
members of this committee have heard um
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
and through our study we have found the
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion that those who have received
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
multiple doses of the MRNA vaccine
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
products um May then go on to produce
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
something called
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
ig4 yeah which to my understanding and
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
not an expert has the effect of an
 
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.270 align:start position:0%
not an expert has the effect of an
immunosuppressant

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressant
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
um is that is there any reason that that
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
could be accurate yeah so there there's
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
a couple things one is you do so it
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
would be more of a the concept of immune
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
tolerance and usually the metaphor
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
people use is The Beekeeper that when he
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
gets stung by a be doesn't have a severe
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
reaction because he's been stung by a be
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
so many times okay um that's a good
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good kind of concept to think
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
about what ig4 means so it's basically
 
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.309 align:start position:0%
about what ig4 means so it's basically
your

00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
immunological um signal to say hey we've
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
seen this before don't overreact let it
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
be when we're talking about a pathogen a
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
pathogen that I just told you causes
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
fibron to form in an abnormal way and
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
causes endothelial damage the last thing
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
you want your body to do is let that
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing be and let it do whatever it wants
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
so immune tolerance in this case is very
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh the other interesting thing
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
is the paper that came out about 12
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
month ago the novax again I'm not
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
advocating for Novac here but the novax
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
didn't do that so it seems to be
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
something unique to the actual mechanism
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
of delivery the MRNA uh but um that
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion in a normal time would have
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
halted the
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh probably halted the roll out and
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
probably had them pull the thing off the
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
market until they could figure out what
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
the heck was going on that's how
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerning something like that should
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
be follow up thank you that's very
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
interesting um and to follow up on that
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
same line of thought if there are some
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
people producing this igg4 as a result
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
of these vaccines is what they are
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
producing going to be necessarily
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
specific to covid infection or is there
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
any possibility that it could result in
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
a reduced immune response to other um
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
pathogens as well I was I would say the
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
answer to that is we don't know usually
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
immunological responses are specific to
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh specific viral proteins um I will say
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing about covid is it
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
does seem to affect the immune system in
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
ways the spike protein in in in ways
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that cause immune um immune tolerance
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
slash immune compromised States more
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
than we've ever seen of any other virus
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
and you probably have seen that in a lot
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
of your friends or people you say hey I
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
used to never get you know a bad cold
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
but now it takes me out in a sense you
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
know you get something that used to be
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know something that would last a day
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
or two now goes into your chest and last
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
two weeks but we're seeing a lot more of
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
that the other thing is the uptick and a
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
lot of these other things I think
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's a CDC um again quoting the CDC
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
but the CDC having atypical pneumonia um
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
or walking pneumonia or pneumonia
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
infections in children right now is kind
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
of out of control um it's it's very
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
different than they've seen in in the
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
past and I think um again it's just
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
speculation and it's you know
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
correlation but it seems that uh these
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of things are again happening
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
faster quicker and just the the health
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
or the immune system of of of people in
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
general is being compromised by the
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
general represent warry
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um Dr Von
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
um as we learned more about
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
covid and who was more susceptible to
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
the effects of that we we initially
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
there was a perception
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
that uh maybe older populations could
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
catch it um as more data became
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
available we learned that
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
really the patients who were dying had
 
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.510 align:start position:0%
really the patients who were dying had
multiple

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
comorbidities associated with this and
 
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:38.270 align:start position:0%
comorbidities associated with this and
um

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
so kind of two questions how does that
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh play
 
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.829 align:start position:0%
uh play
into

00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
um the premise of this being more of a
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
vascular disease versus a respiratory
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
disease and then the second is in
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
talking with colleagues of yours and
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians how did how soon did The
 
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.349 align:start position:0%
Physicians how did how soon did The
Physician

00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
Physician
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
population understand the demographics
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
that were really um most detrimental for
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
catching covid and mo most susceptible
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
and vulnerable to the disease yeah so
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
interesting I mean some of the things
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
that actually covid or the spike protein
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
actually elicits in the immune system
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
are uh not good if you are diabetic if
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
you're overweight there's certain things
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
like one of the things that we look at a
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
lot is called interlan 6 and interlan 6
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's uh it's a it's a cyto kind
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
that is very powerful and causes in in a
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
sense what you would call the cyto kind
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
storm thing that everybody would talk
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
about you would have this kind of
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive issue well interlukin 6 is
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
stored in fat cells uh a lot of it and
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
so those people were more likely to
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
secrete tons of interlan six uh when we
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
talk about the microvasculature the
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
microvasculature in people with diabetes
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
and other uh vascular diseases is
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
already compromised so if you have more
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
damage and more issues in those areas
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to you know basically
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
propagate and further the issue to begin
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
with so it it and looking at most of the
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
data I mean there was almost the
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
comorbidities in people that were
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
hospitalized uh were you know always
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
present represent beler thank you madam
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
chair and to take advantage of your wide
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
ranging expertise in treating both Co
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
and uh vaccine
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
injured I would like to ask about
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
children in particular now in our
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
state we reive testimony from our
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
leading epidemiologists that there were
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
severe illnesses in children at some
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
unspecified rate especially I believe
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
you uh he mentioned um inflammation
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
disorder that came along with covid if
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
our official statistics I believe we
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately had one child pass away as
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
a result of covid and if you look at the
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
v's data for our state if I'm not
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
mistaken I believe and of course it's an
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
imperfect data set but it implies that
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
we may have had several children die
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
after or as a result of vaccination so
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
my question would be can you tell us
 
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
anything about the rates of severe
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
illness that were seen in children as a
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
result of covid and also the
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
consequences that were seen as a result
 
00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:32.029 align:start position:0%
consequences that were seen as a result
of

00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination so on the uh you know PE
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
kids that had severe covid front I mean
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
I I you know probably the only people
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
that I had to put on home oxygen on uh
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
were patients that probably one was 16
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
one was 17 both of them had underlying
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
hematological disorders to begin with uh
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
things that they were born with that
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
made them more susceptible to having
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
issues uh did fine once we got them on
 
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
the right things uh but yes it was not
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
an issue in my acute Clinic uh kids were
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
not really even up until Omron I would
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
argue that kids really didn't get covid
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
um that much it was very very hard for
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
them to get it uh I don't have lots of
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know different theories for that
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
Omron was kind of the game changer all
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
of a sudden kids did get it um the uh
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
but in my long covid SL vaccine injury I
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
see a lot of children and so I go from
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
not seeing anybody in the acute world to
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
seeing lots of people that have residual
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
issues and usually these children uh
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
again the associations that we see are a
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of massed Cell Activation mass cells
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
are an immune cell that lives in our
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
tissue interfaces with the environment
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
so it's in our eyes n ferx or ferx gii
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
track skin it's also perv vascular
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
around the vessel um so these people
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
were already hypers sensitive to things
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
historically they're the typical kid
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you know very picky eater very but
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
they're also a lot of them are
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
hypermobile so I mean and we can go in
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
some deep kind of pathophysiology if you
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to understand how that's happening
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
but they're also very athletic
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
historically a lot of them are big uh
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
CrossCountry Runners big cheerleaders
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
big dancers or gymnasts uh and they've
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
been devastated and they've devastated
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
by the vaccine or just covid I would say
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
it's probably again luckily in my state
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
very few children were actually
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated which I actually think of as
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
a as as as a win for us but um it's it's
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
amazing to me how many of uh these kids
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
have been affected by covid and the
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine in the long term meaning not you
 
00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.309 align:start position:0%
vaccine in the long term meaning not you
know

00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
followup thank you and thank you very
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
much for that and based on that um our
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
state as of right now and as I've said
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
we receive testimony that our state has
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
not developed independently vaccine
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
guidance but we have deferred to Federal
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
guidance in a rather official capacity
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now I believe the
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
DHHS website for children's vaccines
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
will direct parents to the CDC website
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
that does advise parents to get their
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
children vaccinated with the uh mRNA
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine um what would your
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation be to our uh public
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
health professionals regarding that
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
particular um
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
guidance I would I would say use the
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
data use better
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
judgment and from any kid that I see
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
cost represent po
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
off um thank you Madame chair I I have a
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
question about diabetes we received uh
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from our state epidemiologist
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
that allegedly
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh covid is uh Associated uh or like in
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
some cases causing diabetes uh did you
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
hear anything about it yeah there there
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
was a recent study looking at that uh it
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
seems like after covid uh that people
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
are more likely to develop diabetes um
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough I I think a lot of
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
the world's understanding of diabetes
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
always focuses around insulin and the
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
pancreas but the reality is a lot of
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
what goes on when we talk about um
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
diabetes is more of what we call insulin
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
sensitivity and metabolic disorder
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
metabolic dysfunction and so again going
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
back to again I'm biased because this is
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
the arei research but when you damage
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
the microvasculature and the endothelium
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
and and cause issues out in the
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
periphery a lot of these people um do
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
develop you know basically insulin has
 
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
to get out to the tissues to actually
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
cause uh sugar to be uptake by the cell
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
and if it can't do that very effectively
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
you all of a sudden have elevated
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
glucose level
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
your your pancreas starts to make more
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
insulin and you get basically an insulin
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
sensitivity issue which would we would
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
classically call type two
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
diabetes represent
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
wary so if if you're seeing this I'm
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
just curious how are you treating this
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
if this is uh you know if you're seeing
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
this more common I assume this is on the
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
rise than something we can expect yes
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
and so some some of the things that
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually are interesting and when we
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
look at you know there's a paper not too
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
long ago one of the things the actual
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
NIH did in their recover trial was
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
utilize metformin they were surprised to
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
find that
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
metformin actually uh prevented long
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
covid and it actually is a treatment for
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
long covid but again going back to I'm
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
not surprised is because you're actually
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
intervening on the dysfunction that
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
develops and so if you help the body a
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
metformin is a biguanide that is
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
probably a common drug all of y'all
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
probably heard before but it basically
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
sensitizes your body to be able to
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
utilize insulin more effectively and so
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
again keeping your sugar levels down
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
while you have covid not damaging the
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
vasculature and damaging other things
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
you should actually probably not have as
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know dire of consequences after you
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh have covid so we use a lot of things
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
that are metabolically mediated I use a
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
lot of sglt2 Inhibitors which are things
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
like jardians and farga um in treating
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
people with long covid who have what we
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
call post or vaccine injury as well post
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
exertional malays post exertional
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
malaise is the concept of after somebody
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
elicits energy they don't necessarily
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
pay for it right then but the next day
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
they're completely exhausted and uh in
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
my research group what we attribute that
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
to is microvascular what we call
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
localized tissue hypoxia meaning instead
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
of when you go work out at the gym and
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
you're pumping ir and your muscle says
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
hey we might want to break down and get
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
stronger instead in this instance the
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
muscle says we don't have any Oxygen
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
we're angry releases signals that say we
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
need help and you actually get an
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
inflammatory response and that's a lot
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
of what we would describe as post
 
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.390 align:start position:0%

off uh on on a different topic uh you
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned how different countries uh
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
responded differently and if we think
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
like what our government should do in
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
future if there will be a future
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic like uh like one question is
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
like should we look at uh what other
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
countries doing but also like it can
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
lead us to a wrong path because every
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
country had different way of approaching
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
statistics uh like uh like uh in the US
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
often it was uh PCR tests that were
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
giving false positives and uh people
 
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.029 align:start position:0%
giving false positives and uh people
were

01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
over uh uh the number of covid uh uh was
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
over inflated but in some countries it
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
was the the way around like Germany had
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
different type of statistics and like if
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
you say like oh China welded people
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
inside the buildings and now they don't
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
have any death for a week like uh let's
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
do what China does but if their numbers
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
are fake like how can we compare with
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
other countries and if if there any way
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
we can do this comparison and better so
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
first thing I I I think of when I think
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
of kind of an emergency response like
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is the last thing you want to do is
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
dictate from above what everybody needs
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
to do because a lot of times the
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
solutions are going to be from the
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
people on the front lines figuring out
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
what works and what doesn't and actually
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
allowing them to go with their Curious
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
nature and their Ingenuity to find
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
Solutions the problem is is again going
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
back to that what hospitals do well is
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
they safely do things we know how to do
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense and when we're
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
talking about a new virus a new pandemic
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
the last thing you want to do is hold
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
the hand you know tie the hands of a
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
physician on his ability to try things
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
and change from things that aren't
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
working and instead that's was the
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
response it actually they actually
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
scared the Physicians uh in in a couple
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
ways they scared the Physicians from
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
even taking care of paat
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is like telling a fireman that the
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
fire's too hot all right which is crazy
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
you don't need a fireman that's scared
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
of fire uh they also handstrong the
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
Physicians and said no this is our
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
formulary this is the treatment that you
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
have to do despite the fact that it
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't working that is just the almost
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
the definition of insanity and in fact
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
most of the places where they were
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to try things uh had better
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes and those outcomes were
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
because if you allow Physicians to
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
utilize their knowledge base to solve
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
problems locally a lot of times those
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
local problem solvings create ideas and
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
theories that lead to larger structures
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
of treating people I mean the first
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
person to do a coronary bypass didn't
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
roll that out to every hospital he had
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
to he had to try it a couple times and
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
then he got then the actual technique
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
and the proc procedures of doing that
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
developed over time to where you can do
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
it on any Hospital anywhere in New
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in this it was this is the way
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to treat it from day one
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge of actually how to
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
treat it which is just asinine instead
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we need is to empower Physicians
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
Empower freethinkers empow Empower
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
curious people to get their hands on the
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
disease and learn how to treat it the
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
other thing is waiting for a safe
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
like the vaccine was supposedly the
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
savior is the worst way to approach
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
head-on a pandemic and even Dr Redfield
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
who's a friend of mine would say we are
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
spending too much time focusing on a
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine we should be focusing on
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics Therapeutics that actually
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
are antiviral anti-inflammatory and
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
prevent death these vaccines don't
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
prevent infection and so from that
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
standpoint why are we spending so much
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
time on that I mean you know since what
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
2022 monoclinal antibodies were pulled
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
off the market maybe because they
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
thought they had one meaning like oh
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's had Co it's it's over it's
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
behind us but no CO's still with us it's
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
damaging a lot of people uh and the
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
solution damages a lot of people too
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
right now which is the vaccine that they
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
have offered up where are we on
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
developing good Therapeutics for
 
01:08:51.239 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
developing good Therapeutics for
treating

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
diseases represent
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam
 
01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:00.829 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam
chair

01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously Co is now emic it's with us
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
probably always going to be with us um
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
testimony that it is this the natural
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
course of a virus and we receive
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is true of covid
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
that over the course of time it
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
naturally will tend to become less
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
pathogenic less
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
harmful um is there a cause to believe
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
initial strain of covid truly had a
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
catastrophic mortality rate and that it
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
just simply evolved rapidly into
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
something far safer um or is it more
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
likely that the initial reports of a
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
five 6 7% mortality rate were just
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily overblown yeah well I
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
that it's that your lad I mean even jbot
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
aaria in uh s San Marine County or Santa
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
clir County and I mean just proved he
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
just did an antibody study which by the
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
way should have been the first thing
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
anybody had done and just showed you the
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
prevalence of it and what they found was
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
it was you know again point you know
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
there's already a significant amount of
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
people within the county that had had
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
covid and this was you know spring of
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
20120 um and so when you actually add in
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
those statistics the uh the mortality
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
rate comes back down to it's still
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
probably at that time more deadly than
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
the flu but it was not anywhere near the
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
56% that was quoted because again if
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
your denominator only includes cases
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
that have been diagnosed that's a very I
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
mean I thought we got past that a
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
medicine um I have a couple of questions
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
and uh one of them was on the novax that
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
you keep um uh that you said a couple
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
times um that could treat covid um when
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
was that available um because that is
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
not mRNA technology yeah so so it was
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
available at the same time actually um
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh I guess what I will say is just
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
knowing Dr Redfield talking to him at
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
the time that he was in the room where
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
it happened um he and Dr Burks were
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
overruled they wanted to go down the
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
protein subunit um vaccine
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
and uh you know Tony fouchy and Peter
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
marks wanted to go down the MRNA route
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
um but again it it has been available uh
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
there was some in terms of being able to
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
get it at a large scale both of these
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
actual products had never been produced
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
in large Vats meaning they were all you
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
know small studies even the mechanisms
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
and the how they make mRNA for the
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine study was through a PCR process
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
versus uh when they actually rolled it
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
out to the rest of of of the country
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
they utilized what we call a batched
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
eoli process they actually used uh
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
organisms to make it so even it was a
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
different in kind even compared to what
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
was actually in the study uh they
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually in the regulatory documents
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
call it manufacturing process one
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process 2 most people got
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process 2 which was not
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
the way they processed or made the MRNA
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
for the study the novavax um was uh was
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
was again the protein subunit vaccine is
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
a much older technology um and so it was
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
much more uh again you're still being
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
exposed to the spike protein but your
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
body is not becoming a factory for it
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
but it's always it it has been available
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
it was not the wh knighted government uh
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
preferred uh
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
shot represent beler thank you madam
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
chair and on on that topic with the um
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
the existence of pre-existing tested
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
technology versus new
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
technology um and the particular
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who were Champaigne which
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
and I certainly don't intend to sit here
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
and guess at the keys anyone's heart or
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to indict anybody at all but do
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
you feel that there is a
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
problem that some of the people involved
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
with championing the MRNA technology
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
were members of a branch of government
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that simultaneously held part of
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
the patent for that technology and may
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
have stood the profit from it yeah there
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
there was definitely a self-benefit to
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
the to having a technology that was
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
actually more uh held by and actually as
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
we see the royalties roll into to the
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
NIH in the last year which I found
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
fascinating I think it was they had $300
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
million I think the last year of course
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's only I think there's about 280
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
scientists at the NIH so
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I I've heard that New Hampshire
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
they don't pay youall well maybe you
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
need to become a scientist at the NIH
 
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
and you might get some royalties that um
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know but that you mean we're talking
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars if every
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
scientist got you know I mean we're
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking about something you know $400
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
million is not chump change um the uh
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
other thing is yeah I think the mil what
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
I would call the medical industrial
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
complex the uh relationship that
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
industry has uh with our regulatory
 
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.030 align:start position:0%
industry has uh with our regulatory
Authority

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know again it wasn't until the
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
'90s to speed up uh drug approval that
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh the actual uh budget of a lot of
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
these studies that the FDA required
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
could be uh financed by pharmaceutical
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
companies um and so 70% of the fda's
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
budget is provided by licensing fees and
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
other things uh and if you have that
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of budgetary
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh involvement then uh you're going to
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot more Sway and I think that is
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues that we have in
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
government uh what I'd say the NIH FDA
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
right now the other thing that was
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
interesting and this has actually came
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
up when I was uh speaking uh before the
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee was uh it was
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
interesting to find the person that
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
testified with me uh Philip Krauss was
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
the uh was one of the lead scientists
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
was cabber which is uh the biologics and
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
eval you know basically they they
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
approved biologic things so meaning they
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
approved biologics blood products um and
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
2021 uh was being pushed to license the
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine and his in his
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
testimony uh he says that the reason
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
that he was being pushed and told by
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
Peter Marx was because we need to
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
license it so we can mandate it well the
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
problem is is that is not a scientific
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
way to license something you don't
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
license something because you need it
 
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
mandated you license something because
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
you say it is safe and effective based
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
on the standards that you have set forth
 
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
for the people that you represent as a
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority now he was removed
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
from his post and Peter Marx took over
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
his position and he approved the vaccine
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
of course Peter marks went on to have 40
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
YouTube videos promoting the
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine interestingly enough the FDA is
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
not involved in the promotion of
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
products in fact it's not what they
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
should be doing they are not an arm of
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
Industry to uh to advertise they are a
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority holding industry to
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
account and safety for the citizens so
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
the fact to have that FDA person
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
approval basic and actually Thomas
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
Massie during that hearing played Peter
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
Marx's videos and it's just so
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the way that we think
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
authorities represent p is
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
off um could could we go deeper into uh
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
incentives and how um
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
a physician can be uh free of it and
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
what uh different uh uh place in it uh
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned uh uh Federal uh regul
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation that was
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
um focusing on certain treatments and uh
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
putting some monetary
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
incentivization for it
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh when we talk to our state government
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
they often say that they are not
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
involved with setting up treatment
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
protocols for hospitals that there's
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
certain associations uh medical
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
associations that advise hospitals how
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
to treat uh patients but uh we also know
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
so so there are some incentives from
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
federal legislation then I don't know if
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's always a middle man but there's
 
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.390 align:start position:0%
it's always a middle man but there's
some

01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
insurance companies uh um working for
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
government insurances or otherwise who
 
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.669 align:start position:0%
government insurances or otherwise who
um

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
maybe uh put uh some incentives for
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
doctors and hospitals to treat in
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
certain way so how does it work and uh
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
how your practice uh is able to be more
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
flexible in what you do
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
so first thing is yes I mean you could
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
it's probably a the argument to say
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
well how something gets reimbursed won't
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
dictate how we treat and that's just
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
being foolish uh the honest truth is
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
most of these especially in the americ
 
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
medical American Medical system you know
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
these are the profit incentive there is
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know a lot of the times just even
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
treating covid patients at the time that
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the hospital had to be be
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
shut down these Hospital administrators
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
as well as the mdal managers were just
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way you know and so
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
trust me they read over the cares act
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
the cares act also involved a lot of
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
direct funding to these Hospital systems
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
but in in addition they found that the
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
incentivizing of taking care of covid
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
patients was was quite to their
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
advantage now in the end at the time
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
that they made the those recommendations
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're talking April of 2020
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that the recommendations
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
at the time that meaning not the
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
commendations the legislation were
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily had we figured out that this
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
was the wrong thing to do but the worst
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
thing you can do is codify a treatment
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
based on payment before you even know
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
how to treat it but that's so that's the
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
last thing I would do the other thing is
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
um empowering you know one of the things
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
I did again was trying to find a way of
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
taking care of healthy people with
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
chronic additions in my clinic but at
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
the same time I did not believe that
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
telling a patient that was sick that
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
wait until they can't breathe and go to
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
Theos hospital was the best way to treat
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
somebody and so what I said was we've
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
got to find an effective way to do this
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
within my clinics and so I had um I had
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
drive up testing but in when these
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
patients would test positive they would
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
be able to come into a part of the
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
clinic that they could get treatment
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
including monoclonal antibodies the same
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
day that they were diagnosed positive
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay and so my outcomes were incredible
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
we probably treated over 20,000 people
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you know had two deaths among those
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
people and that I mean you're talking
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
again that's more statistically in line
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
with with what you would expect but it
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
was the fact that we had to set up a
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
system to understand how do we assess
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
who's positive who needs treatment and
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
then how do we follow up with them so
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
again going back to the coagulation
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
issue on a lot of those people I would
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
have them come back six days later get a
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
dher get a chest x-ray and actually
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
learned that if I implemented
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
anti-coagulation day six they didn't go
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
to the hospital day 11 and 14 and and so
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
again that was just learning as you go
 
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
where the signals are and where to
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
intervene but when you tell all of
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
society uh Physicians that they can't
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
see somebody until day 14 you're missing
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
the most important days to determine
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
what the heck works and so again goes
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
back to and you can see this probably in
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
the Physicians you know the media
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
reports of Physicians dying and the
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians dying in China I'm not really
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
sure what the motive was at the time but
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
they scared the hell out of Physicians
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
and they scared the older ones
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
especially and I think a lot of times um
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
that had a deleterious effect to the
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
patient needing treatment when
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
patient follow up uh follow up uh what's
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
the situation currently with monoclonal
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
antibodies you said something about them
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
being removed I remember Florida was
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
champion in this treatment but then
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
government kind of n nationalized it and
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
said it will be centrally distributed is
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
this treatment Now not available at all
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
or yes so the monoc there are some still
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
available monoclinal antibodies uh for
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
specific reasons they're very expensive
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
um again uh but it they actually kind of
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
turned off the spet on monoclonal
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
antibodies uh in April of 2022 I think
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
which was kind of Sur surprising uh the
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
interesting thing was even that is an
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
example of insanity um so our state
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
Alabama was uh they actually C were
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
centrally given the monoclonal
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
antibodies so what I had to do as a as a
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
owner as well as an advocate for my
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
patients is get to know the legislators
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
really well to find out who the heck is
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
the state pharmacist and then find out
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
where the heck these monoclonal
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
antibodies are okay now most doctors
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do that I'm a little
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
crazy great um but it was interesting to
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
find out I was actively treating
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
patients day one of positive test having
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
great outcomes while a lot of the big
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals had hundreds if not thousands
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of these Doses and they hadn't used them
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
because they weren't useful day
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
14 so what did I have to do is get the
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislator involved to get me to get the
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
med to get the monoclonal doses from the
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
hospital because the hospital had no
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
interest in treating people day one
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't blame them they were taking
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
care of the people day 14 but you know
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
what they they really complained a lot
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
about all these sick people well there's
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
a solution how about give the monoclonal
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
antibodies to me to get people treated
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%
so they don't overwhelm your hospital
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
but that's not a solution that they ever
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
thought of so it was a solution that I
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
had to come I had I had employees
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
driving four hours to go to some random
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
hospital in South Alabama that didn't
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
even know they had 100 doses is that
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
just to show you again how the kind of
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
top down approach spread it all out
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
equally uh has its
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
consequences followup so follow up on my
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
previous question so what allows you to
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
be that flexible do you not take are you
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
not taking medic and Medicaid and other
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
insurances or are you under different
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
Licensing what allows us this
 
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.070 align:start position:0%
Licensing what allows us this
flexibility

01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
so I Am My Own Boss
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
effectively the patients are my boss I
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
own my own pharmacies I own my own
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
clinics I own my own buildings I know
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
again this isn't the idea for everybody
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
but at that point there wasn't anybody
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
that said no you can't do
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
that and there is a there is freedom of
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
curiosity in settings that you're
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to help and so it was kind of a
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
calling to say no one else is doing what
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think should be done so why not do it
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of doctors in the current
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
world aren't Their Own Boss I mean
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
actually my father physician in the 70s
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
and 80s um they were uh you know for the
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
most part there were private group
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
practices most of them paid their own
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
kind of way paid their own salaries they
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
worked with hospitals but at the end of
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
the day when there was a disagreement
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
between the hospital and the doctor it
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
was because the patient wasn't taken
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
care of correctly now when there's a
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the doctor and the
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
hospital the doctor gets fired by the
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
hospital the patient doesn't benefit and
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's the problem is we have taken the
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
ability of Physicians to be curious and
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
also uh actively be involved in what
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
they think is best for their patient
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
medicine represent
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
wary thank you madam chair um the Dr Von
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh the discussion about treating
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
patients finally at day 14 reminded me
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
of a couple of things I I
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
saw um some studies where they attempted
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
to treat patients with icin or hydroxy
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
chloric wind but the problem was those
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
patients were too far progressed in the
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
disease they were you know died a few
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
days ABS you know afterwards and so
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
no it was a what I would call and I I
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
have had about 40 years in
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
the the pharmaceutical medical device
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
industry so I'm somewhat familiar with
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
this you know I I thought was a poorly
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
designed study yeah because you're
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
treating patients who are too far gone
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to get your comments on
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
that and and then kind of a a second
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
aspect is that um I think these studies
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
were also used to then uh state that
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin or ior were were not
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
useful and you know we've found out
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
since then government agencies have
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
actually reversed that position um but I
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
had people telling me that these these
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
drugs were actually dangerous where uh
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
having traveled to India several times
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know I was taking hydroxy
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
chloroquin as an antimalarial yeah and I
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's one of the safest drugs around and
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
so I I was really confounded by
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
the publicity that was getting out there
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
versus good science so if you could I
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
know that's a lot to unpack but if you
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
could comment on that so the first thing
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
is yes they were not uh they were not
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
poorly designed they were intentionally
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
designed and they were intentionally you
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
can design a study to make your product
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
look like it works but it you can easily
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
design a study that shows you a product
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and actually that's what
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
you'll have you'll find in throughout
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately pharmaceutical trials um
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of even pharmaceutical
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
trials that are you know backdoor
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
sponsored in some ways by the competitor
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
to utilize the cheaper option or the
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
more you know the safer option to prove
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
its uh inferiority to whatever product
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
might be you know higher up uh meaning
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
more more reimbursable more new more
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
patentable um the interesting thing and
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is again
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
I guess my background as a chemical
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
engineer uh allowed me to understand
 
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is medicines are molecules or
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
natural occurring substances that act on
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
Maman cells when things that are matter
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
to us uh that does not limit them from
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
acting on other mammals cells as well
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing is just because they're
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
approved for one mechanism of action
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
does not mean they are no longer to have
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms of action in fact By
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
definition most medicines have something
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
called side effects that half the time
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
are dependent on the fact that they have
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms of actions that cause
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
issues okay again this is just basic but
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about a world that
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
is acting completely crazy uh hydroxy
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
chloroquin approved in the 70s in my
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
Harrison's textbook of medicine as an
 
01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:51.070 align:start position:0%
Harrison's textbook of medicine as an
antiviral

01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
antiviral
 
01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.030 align:start position:0%
antiviral
antiviral

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
antiviral
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
now again does it have efficacy in covid
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
you are correct that the trials for it
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
were designed inappropriately the other
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
thing is in the summer of
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
2021 the data that they used for the big
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
jamama and Lancet study didn't actually
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
exist and it actually took some slle on
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
the internet to prove that there was
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
something called surgisphere which was
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
this guy in Chicago that had a had a had
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
a female
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
escort as the head of the I mean it was
 
01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
it was like once you did a little
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
background to look and say see this data
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
set and see the origin of this data set
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
this data set didn't come from anywhere
 
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
legit but the Lancet and and New England
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
Journal were
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
so committed to their biases that they
 
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
wanted that data to be true even though
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
it accounted for more people than
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
actually live in Australia you know like
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
it it was it was and they all had to
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
issue an apology but the problem is is
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
when when when you're looking as a
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
scientist when you're looking and I
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
again I have to check myself all the
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
time when I'm looking for something that
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
corresponds and and basically uh you
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
know confirms my
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
biases I like that meaning I I want to
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
promote it uh but that's where medicine
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
exposed itself and so again that
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
retraction of the dangers of hydroxy
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
chloroquin uh no one ever published the
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
retraction that data that was pushed
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
pushed out in the summer of
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
2021 is still assumed to be legitimate
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
even though the Lancet in J in New
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
England Journal probably one of the
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
bigger probably scandals that they've
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
had in a long time uh and they had to
 
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
retract things but the retractions never
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
covered uh same thing with things like
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
ior mechon uh Iver mechon is a one of
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
the safer medicines we've ever found in
 
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
fact I'd probably argue that half the
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
stuff on a over-the-counter Pharmacy
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
shelf is way more dangerous than ior
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
mechon um but it again provided relief
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
it provided people the opportunity or
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the possibility of treatment and I think
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
that was what the train that was rolling
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
toward the vaccine didn't want in its
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
pathway which was an
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
alternative uh possibility of something
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
that effectively treats the
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
condition followup yeah if I'm if I'm
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
may just comment on that briefly is that
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
you're you're right if there is an
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment then you don't get
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization and so if if
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
any of these things were were to have
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
been found even moderately effective no
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh emergency use authorization would
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
have been approved would have uh
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
facilitated the distribution of the
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
I have so many questions
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
um where to start
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
um so I guess a basic question would be
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
is we have heard testimony in this
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee that people felt like their
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
voices were
 
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
squelched that differing opinions from
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
the medical community were not getting
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
out there to
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
heard um in regard to
 
01:33:27.119 --> 01:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
heard um in regard to
treatment

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
um so that there could have been
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
options um and just in listening to what
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative warry said that if there
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
were options then emergency use you know
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
utilized how was your voice was your
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
voice being squelched at any time during
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you know again at least at
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
the state of Alabama um it was you know
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
again the Medical Association of the
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
state of Alabama the state health
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
officer are all um kind of in their own
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh world and they were following
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably as your state does whatever the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
CDC or the federal authorities say or in
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
all honesty probably whoever gave them
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
money but that's just you know in
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
general um the uh but yeah I mean I was
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
called down uh I had other Physicians
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
turn in um turn me in uh Physicians i'
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
had never met um and uh Physicians would
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
write letters saying he is spreading you
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
know lies by saying the vaccine doesn't
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
present infection well by the time I got
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
down to the to the board pretty much
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
everything I was turned into in in for
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
was actually correct uh but at the time
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
it just shows you how even within the
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
confines of medicine uh um uh there is
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
that uh there's there's tattle tailing
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
and backbiting and those kind of things
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I found uh
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
interesting was you know that all of
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
these people uh I didn't understand
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
their point of doing what they were
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
doing because uh it didn't make
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
sense uh didn't didn't make sense to
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
spend time to turn somebody else in that
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
was having success in helping people
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
does that make sense like um it it's
 
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.790 align:start position:0%
does that make sense like um it it's
just

01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
very you know but the the one thing I
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
will say is the other thing that gives
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
me the freedom to do this is because I
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
have the resources so uh you know
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting a letter from the board and then
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
having lawyers uh you know defend you
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily cheap um I have the
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
resources to do it I probably have more
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
law firms on retainer than I know what
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
to do with unfortunately but but uh for
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
a guy like me I guess they picked the
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
wrong person because I was not scared I
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
was not squelched by fear it was just
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
like well I'm going to have to spend you
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
know $50 $100,000 not it's worth it
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
let's go and I think that mentality
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
especially if you're a private
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
practitioner out independently you know
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have a $50,000 sitting around
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
to defend yourself instead you're like
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
let me just shut up I got to feed my
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
family I got to pay my mortgage um and
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
so so there is that it goes back to why
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
I have that freedom to do it is because
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
I also know that uh you know I again pay
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
my own bills but also have the resources
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I'm defended
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately because you know the other
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
thing that I was turned in for was um at
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh I went to my own child's board
 
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
meeting uh school board meeting uh he
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
was becoming a kindergarten my wife
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
loved this obviously because it was uh I
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
think he had just started kindergarten
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
that Friday in the board meeting was
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
Monday and of course I get up there and
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and tell them what my thoughts uh in
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
terms of you know the fact that this is
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know regardless of what you let
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's let's you know basically on a lot
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
of times I try to debate not necessarily
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know whether they're e efficacious
 
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
at getting people you know keeping
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
people from being affected mine was an
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
argument of what do we not know and it
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
can't be good to actually Mass children
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
during their you know most you know
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
development Al times of both language uh
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know non-verbal cues their ability
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
to interact with other kids and and
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
their teacher having the teacher hug
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
them I mean elementary school I mean
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
like your teacher is a big part of your
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
life she's like literally my kids's
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
teacher can say something and what I
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
said doesn't even matter I mean like
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's you know um but I was two
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
infectious disease physicians at the end
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
got up and said the opposite and one of
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
them thankfully the other one didn't I
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a little more respect for him but
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
the other infectious disease Physicians
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
said we know that there's no long-term
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
consequences to Children wearing
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
masks which just again the guy that's
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be up there with telling us
 
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
about the science because he's an
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
infectious disease doctor is the one
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's really you know spouting the
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
stuff that's completely opinion-based
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
and nonscientific and so um but I did
 
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
you know call the Attorney General of
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
our State and ask if I had given up my
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
right to free speech again I was not I
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
was there as a parent and a physician
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
obviously um a parent could make this
 
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
argument that's the other thing it
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a you know uh mask
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
might not be good for my child it's not
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
a um but uh and asked if I had given up
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
my right to free speech when I became a
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
licensed physician in the state and
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
evidently I hadn't but evidently the
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
board thought I might have because I was
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
investigated for it you know
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
um just based on what you just said and
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
only because uh we've heard testimony
 
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.550 align:start position:0%
only because uh we've heard testimony
from

01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
parents um a statement you made was
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
there was an infectious disease
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
doctor that said Mass didn't have
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
long-term effects on
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
children as an infectious disease doctor
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
what was his area of expertise with
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
masking in children to make that
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
statement none and that's the problem
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
but even then expertise is not is not
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
the issue anyway I mean I would say that
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
no one I you know who knows he could be
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
correct but I knew that no one had ever
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
done that study because you couldn't
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
even get masking children at school
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
approved through an IRB because it's
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
unethical like you couldn't have done
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
that study before covid because no one
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
would allow it to happen no IRB at any
 
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
Institute would say hey yeah let's mask
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
those kids for six months and see what
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
unethical so basically there was no
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
study done to make any blanket
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
statements of anything yeah
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
um in regards to studies I think we
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
touched upon this and I'm not positive
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
if we touch upon it uh here but prior to
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
covid there were studies done on
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
masking uh where it showed that there
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
was no uh difference uh between masking
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the flu and we knew that the Micron
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
of the covid virus would be it
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't yeah it was air it was air it
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
was not a droplet type disease thank you
 
01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
was not a droplet type disease thank you
represent

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you madam chair and the the
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
timing is somewhat fortuitous here as I
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
was just a few moments ago made aware of
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
a uh official report of findings from
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
the United States House of
 
01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives and Energy and Commerce
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
Committee uh in a report on a particular
 
01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
messaging campaign around co9 during the
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic period and one of the official
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
findings of this US House
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
report is that the Department of Health
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and public health
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
officials um made attempts to silence
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
dissenting scientific opinions during
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so I'd just like to give
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
you a chance to comment on that
 
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
finding yeah again I mean that's
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
antithetical to what you know the basis
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and Foundation of medicine or just
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
science is I mean I think dissenting
 
01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
opinion is the core of well I mean what
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
I say is alternative opinion doesn't
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to always be dissenting um but uh
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
it's I mean I it's an interesting world
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
decided represent po
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
off uh I have a question uh about Spike
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
protein getting into heart like um covid
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh as I understand it it's
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be injected intramuscular
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the idea is that all the
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
produced Spike protein will stay in this
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
compounded uh part of of a muscle and
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
won't go traveling around the body so
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
can can you come comment on it yeah we
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
knew that to be true before that it
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
didn't it wouldn't stay in the muscle
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and we know that to be true
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
after I mean mRNA has been found in
 
01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:38.679 align:start position:0%
breast milk mRNA has been found in heart
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
muscle mRNA has been found in ovary I
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
tissue

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
tissue
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
followup uh Al also a testimonia um I
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
received here here in the house uh uh
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
previously and I confirmed it that uh
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
CDC has a guidance on vaccine injection
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
and uh on vaccines it's called pink book
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's on yeah CDC website and somewhere
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the middle of pandemic response they
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
changed the way vaccines are
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
administered and uh they said in
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
injected quickly with no aspiration I
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
think the term is aspiration when you
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
pull back to check if there's a blood
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that recommendation was based on
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
some very small study in Canada with a
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
very limited group that said that
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
allegedly there's no difference if we
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
inject quickly or slowly with
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
aspirational no aspiration so let's
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
inject quickly with no aspiration but
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
um the argument for aspiration and slow
 
01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
injection was exactly not to Rapture the
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
tissue and not to and limit U the chance
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
that vaccine will go into blood instead
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
of muscle yeah yeah I I didn't know they
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
had changed that but yes the the reason
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
that you aspirate typically is to make
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
vessel represent beler yes just to
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarify that on the record we do have
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
that um the change within this
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee's records that was made not
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
not during covid but in some time
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
immediately preceding covid was made as
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
an official recommendation I believe of
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
a major nursing group based on the
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
um what they said was that there had
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
never been proper studies done
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the efficacy of
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
aspirations so we should just go ahead
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
sounds

01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
about representative po
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
off oh it's a little bit personal but uh
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
just La last week uh in my district uh
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
in Dan Barton New Hampshire one
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
constituents confided that he was uh
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
injured by covid vaccine and and still
 
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
have lingering issues so uh I don't know
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
if you can advise like uh um are there
 
01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
if you can advise like uh um are there
are

01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
any groups in New Hampshire that can
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
help my constituents especially that
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
previously we heard that people with
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries sometimes they double
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
victimized with their doctors because
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
their doctor doesn't want to admit that
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
the person was injured by vaccine so
 
01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh uh they B being uh uh
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
denied uh for the treatment or something
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh or or they're being treated for
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
something unrelated uh without
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing the reasoning for their
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
illness two two things what I mean one
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
the organizations like react 19 or uh
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
lcccc uh again I'm a micro I'm a fellow
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
of the flccc which is basically consor
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
of Physicians that in some ways have
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
become people that question the
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
Orthodoxy uh but during Co we were
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
definitely questioning the
 
01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
Orthodoxy uh but uh the other thing that
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
I find just in my kind of taking care of
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccine injured and the long covid
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
is um sometimes just allowing them to
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
know that you heard them but also that
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
they're harmed by this is isn't I mean
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
people will cry because they have been
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
to 20 to 30 doctors that have told them
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
the opposite and I think that's just
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
such a it reveals in some ways what
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
medicine has become unfortunately very
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
heartless uh and it has lost its art it
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
has become a uh and by Art I mean
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine is actually
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
understanding and caring and in some
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
sense loving the person in front of you
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
and seeing that they have value
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
um public health statistics protocols
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
those kind of things remove that and I I
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes think it's intentional to
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
create callous
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians uh and create you know I
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
guess in the end will'll be replaced by
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
AI anyway but meaning like where they're
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know that there's there's no one
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
understanding what's unique to them but
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
that is uh that's the hardest part for a
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
lot of these people the other hard part
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a we had a webinar about
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
it um Wednesday is them seeking
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
compensation for their injuries is
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult because they covid
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine was not covered under the
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh harm program the you know
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
vcap so it is covered under a
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
countermeasure um program and that
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
countermeasure program is underfunded I
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
think at the time that they were last uh
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know questioned under the house
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee there were six members of it
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh so we're talking about you know
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of claims and I think eight
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
total people have been paid out of total
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
of $400,000 for the whole
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
country um that that is an injustice in
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
in my book and um it needs to be
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
rectified I think there's some things
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
that they're doing at the federal level
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
to do that but it is it is even sadder
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
when you realize that even
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
the what the the safety net for vaccine
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
injured that was developed even though
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's inadequate these people don't even
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
wary uh thank you madam chair uh just
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
um we understand you're from Alabama and
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
that uh is there any particular
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
legislation or regulations within
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
Alabama that allowed you to do what you
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
did um I'm trying to look at it from the
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislator standpoint for a moment and
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
and say okay how can how can New
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire create this same sort of
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
environment that allowed you to prosper
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
and your patients to prosper how can we
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
create that within New Hampshire and so
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on that at all
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
so you
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
know Alabama is still not a very free
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
state when it comes to things that occur
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
within the hospital I mean it's kind of
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
run by the medical board and the
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
hospital Association um we have a
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
certificate of Need for any kind of
 
01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
hospital bed that needs to be approved
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
which I think we need to get rid of uh
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
it limits the ability for private
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
physicians to find ways to take care of
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
their patients outside the opice of the
 
01:50:07.229 --> 01:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
crazy bureaucratic infrastructure that
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
is the hospital systems gives the
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
hospital systems tons of power uh but
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
those are the things that I I think
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
allowing Physicians and groups of
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians uh to form and Thrive uh is
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
really getting rid of regulatory burden
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
or uh find yeah I would say the
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden of creating clinics
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
opening places for treatment I mean
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
again I mean I I was lucky I own my own
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and had um you know had
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
clinics that I could have Bunches of
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
people come in and get infused with
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibodies uh and also had
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
enough space that I could do it in a
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
place that was you know meaning wasn't
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of where the other people were uh
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't but that you know if you
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
were to say hey I'm going to go open a
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
clinic to take care of these people just
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
the regulatory burden to do that would
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
have been you
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
know 18 months or something like that so
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
you need to especially on a pandemic
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
time of thing and I think they tried to
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
do this initially they allowed doctors
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
to cross state borders you know they did
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
all this kind of stuff because they they
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
saw in need they needed more people but
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more of that that you can
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
do especially in a time of emergency you
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
know almost taking the rails off for a
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
in a good way allowing people to prosper
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
and figure out things and try
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
things um along the lines um and you
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
know you don't have to answer um are you
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to accept health insurance at your
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
clinics yeah yeah yeah I mean I I'm I'm
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
the same I mean I am basically a you
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
know a family a classic Primary Care
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
Organization so meaning it's you know
 
01:51:51.390 --> 01:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
everything we don't take Medicaid mainly
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
because we don't see
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
classically pediatricians see children
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
so well you know there's a lot of I'll
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
say we probably don't take Medicaid
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
because filling out the application
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
probably takes more time than it's worth
 
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
meaning because that's just how many
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
children we typically see um but
 
01:52:08.669 --> 01:52:08.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare and every I mean it was you
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
know basically approved by all but even
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that I actually have to hire somebody
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
that's their full-time job is to
 
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
credential my Physicians and make sure
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
that their you know te's are crossed and
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
their eyes are dotted for every little
 
01:52:22.079 --> 01:52:23.109 align:start position:0%
their eyes are dotted for every little
insurance

01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
that exist and that you know again
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's why a lot of these places can't
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
exist on their own because cash flow and
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
those kind of things are hard if you
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how to do it uh and you don't
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
have enough volume of scale you know to
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
hire somebody that literally their whole
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
job is to make sure that doctors are
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
signed up for insurance is that's how
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
crazy the world has
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
become um and on the lines of Medicare
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious um
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
did you have to follow any certain
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
protocols at your practice in order to
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
receive reimbursement during the
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic I did not because within that
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
um there was an exception for
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.149 align:start position:0%
um there was an exception for
office-based

01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
office-based
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians which thankfully that
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
exception existed because if it didn't I
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
would not be accepting
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare okay right because we saw that
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
at our County nursing homes um where
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so the regulatory burden is is
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
becomes more heavy so again going back
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
to the like why I was I able to do it is
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
being able to be an office-based
 
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
physician that didn't have to interface
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
with all these regulatory things allows
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
the freedom to treat patients especially
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
in a time of a pandemic with Innovative
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
things and just in the answer to uh
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative War's question uh we do
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
allow and I know we were trying to pass
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
but we do allow
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
concierge doctors now um or you know
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
practicing nurse practitioners but right
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
now they have to practice under a
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
certain license but I think we're trying
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
to loosen that aspect uh represent
 
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
um forgive me I I don't remember if this
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
was discussed in our hearing now or just
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
prior to it during casual conversation
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned that there was a a
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
fairly dramatic disparity in being able
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
to receive funding for studies looking
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
at um covid injury uh and long covid
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
versus vaccine injury yeah um and I know
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
personally as somebody who was vaccine
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
injured I've had multiple doctors um
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
upon learning that I was a vaccine
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
injury patient have their demeanor
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
drastically change and no longer wish to
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
treat me I've heard the same thing from
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
other people in a in a similar position
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is do you think that
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
these things are linked and that there's
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of official government actions
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
or messaging or incentives that
 
01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
contributed to that kind of
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
environment I don't know that there's an
 
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive structure in place
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
I would think I feel like again um I
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
think y'all had Aaron Siri testify a
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago but uh one of you know
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things he challenged me was
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
how much vaccine education did you get
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
in med school it's a very interesting
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
question because there's not vaccine
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
education in med school there is when do
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
you give the vaccines education in med
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
school which is those are the questions
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
when where how often those aren't
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
questions of the science or the efficacy
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
or the safety but instead it's already
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
assumed that they're safe effective and
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
people like you don't exist so for a
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
physician to have to confront that that
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
is not an easy thing for them to do and
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
they don't like to do it they don't like
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
off Could you um do you have any
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on a
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
framework that is called science-based
 
01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.870 align:start position:0%
framework that is called science-based
medicine

01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
so today we talked about some problems
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
with public health statistics and that
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
research uh is sometimes uh biased uh
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
and there are some conflicts of interest
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the research papers and my
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is if we then take those
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
biased research papers and
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
centrally U mandate uh those findings to
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
every every doctor despite their own
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
observation so maybe that's the problem
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
with current approach because uh in the
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
science-based medicine sounds great
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
because science is great medicine is
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
great but if framework is flood so do
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on how how is is
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
there are any underlying problems and
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
are ways to fix
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
it so I do think you know I went through
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
medical school in uh 2005 to
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
2009 and that was at the time that there
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
was this conversion to what we would
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
call evidence-based medicine
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine is a fancy term
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
that you'll probably hear a lot of
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians that's not evidence-based y y
 
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
y um it is useful for especially
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
evaluating certain
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
things uh you know but it
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
requires a lot lot of information a lot
 
01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:56.679 align:start position:0%
of robust trials uh that literally the
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
only people that can afford things to
 
01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
prove on the randomized control trial uh
 
01:58:04.589 --> 01:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
versus placebo world are pharmaceutical
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
industry or some type of government
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
industry that has a lot of money and so
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
that means uh that uh if you were to
 
01:58:15.550 --> 01:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
boil everything down to evidence-based
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
medicine medicine becomes protocol-based
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
and doesn't assess and doesn't care
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily about the person that you're
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
taking care of in front of you I think
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine informs you it
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
gives you help and understanding a
 
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
disease process it gives you help in
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
understanding mechanisms of actions of
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
medicines it gives you understanding
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
that hey this does have a therapeutic
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
effect it doesn't replace the fact that
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're a physician taking care of a
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
single individual and that single
 
01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
individual is unique and I think that is
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
where that disconnect has happened um it
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
it requires uh I kind of again in my
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of the Judiciary one
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
of the things I've always heard you know
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
you'll heard the word follow the science
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
and the problem is is that it's not
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
really a good term science isn't a
 
01:59:08.430 --> 01:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
leader science isn't an Informer science
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
is a uh it records data it people
 
01:59:18.430 --> 01:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
lead people should be informed by
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
science in how they lead but to follow
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
science is a really stupid statement
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
because science itself doesn't make
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
decisions and it doesn't say that with
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
this information you have to do this
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
instead it is just the information it's
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the data and a leader a
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
human somebody
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
with with with skills to interpret it is
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
the one that makes decisions and so
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's where that's where the whole
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
missing of that is science isn't a
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
leader and in fact when you let science
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
lead it's a crazy crazy
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
Road representative
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
think with that statement I think you've
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
effectively put science in the box that
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
I would agree where it should properly
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
go and to continue on that same line of
 
02:00:16.119 --> 02:00:17.870 align:start position:0%
go and to continue on that same line of
thinking

02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
because uh science is a tool of analysis
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
and understanding
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're not everybody has the ability to
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
become an expert on everything so
 
02:00:32.669 --> 02:00:32.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to rely on certain persons
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
and institutions largely to um
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
authenticate the analysis and the
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
science so with that in mind what is
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
your feeling about the present health of
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
our institutions and particularly those
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
so if anything the last four years have
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
revealed that
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
you're what I would say medical as well
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
as you could you could associate Public
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
Health I like to separate them but your
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
medical infrastructure the people that
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
take care of you um it's broken and I
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
think the last four years exposed that
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
because when they were um when they were
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
um approached or affected by some new
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
thing the response was very inflexible
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
it was very callous it was very not
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
Humane um and those an organization
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
usually kind of exposes itself when it's
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
put under pressure you know so as much
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
as you see the signs that say this
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospital system loves and whatever
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
during covid they didn't really act like
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
that did they um and the peerreview
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
process is just as um first of all peer
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
review peer reviewers aren't paid
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh they usually do it from an academic
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
Ivory Tower uh the journals themselves
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
are uh owned by multi uh you know
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
multinational organizations that
 
02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
basically have huge revenue and and
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
profit uh and for me to even get access
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
to a typical Journal you have to be part
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
of a university which is what I have to
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
do on the side to to make sure that I
 
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
have you know Library access to all
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
these journals Because the actual
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge is not even you know
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not even published but
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
even when it is published good luck
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
getting your hands on it if you don't
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
have an Institutional um an
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
Institutional sign in um and then the
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
other thing is is the NIH is really
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
responsible I think this is again going
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
back to um how I look at medical schools
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
now a little has changed where medical
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
schools used to be state in state or
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
private institutions that their Charter
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
was to prepare and teach Physicians to
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
take care of of the citizens of their
 
02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
take care of of the citizens of their
state

02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
um most medical schools have turned into
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
pre-employment programs for their
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar academic Medical
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
Center and instead of patient or
 
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians being trained to take care of
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the citizens of the state they are
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
trained to be a Hos you know a system
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
physician and that really does take away
 
02:03:19.229 --> 02:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
their curiosity but the other thing is
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
the funding for all these institutions
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
comes from one source for the most part
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
when you talk about how medical schools
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
are ranked or academic institutes are
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
ranked it's based on NIH dollars you
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
know how much money do they have you
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
know I think UAB has something like $500
 
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
million a year well I mean as a
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
businessman I've dealt with banks before
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
and if your uh your business's
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
Enterprise is based on
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
somebody's Financial commitment to you
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
you listen
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
to that person if they want you to do
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
something or if they want you not to do
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
something and I think that's what we
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
have to realize is the money that is
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
delved out uh from the federal
 
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
government to these academic institutes
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
is very powerful in um in shaping
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
freely follow
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
up yes and along the the same lines of
 
02:04:22.719 --> 02:04:24.910 align:start position:0%
up yes and along the the same lines of
thinking

02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
um the disparities that exist say now
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
from 20 years ago as far as your smaller
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians Group and your self-employed
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
Physicians versus your larger
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
conglomerations seems to have shifted
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
rather dramatically I think some of us
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
might make an argument that uh the
 
02:04:44.589 --> 02:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act had the effect of
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the regulatory burden on
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
smaller practices such that many wound
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
up selling to largers I would say that
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
the co pandemic was a one twoo punch for
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of practices who
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
likewise um W end up having to sell to
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
larger conglomerations we I've seen that
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
personally my own physician had to had
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
to sell his practice up to a to a
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
conglomerate um and the reason this is
 
02:05:13.549 --> 02:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
important to I believe this committee is
 
02:05:16.589 --> 02:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
that there is a function within the New
 
02:05:16.599 --> 02:05:17.950 align:start position:0%
that there is a function within the New
Hampshire

02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution that requires this
 
02:05:24.669 --> 02:05:24.679 align:start position:0%
government to to take action where
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
necessary against Monopoly and in and in
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
favor of um open free trade and
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
availability so I guess my question for
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
you is knowing what has happened do you
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
believe that we're at a point yet where
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
State authorities or federal authorities
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
might do well to take a good look at
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
Monopoly provisions of constitutions and
 
02:05:51.239 --> 02:05:52.229 align:start position:0%
Monopoly provisions of constitutions and
law

02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
as it applies to the current health care
 
02:05:58.109 --> 02:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
environment yeah I mean I think at my
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
own state level um you know one of the
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
things that I think is you know when we
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the power of different
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
medical boards and those kind of things
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
I think some of the rules need to be you
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
know if you're a physician that works
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
for the hospital there are only so many
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
seats that can be filled on that board
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be independent
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians so in terms of just your own
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
Physicians uh whatever your Board of
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine or whatever you have you have
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
to have representation from it it needs
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to be less than less than half of that
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
can be from people that are within
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
government you know like whether it's
 
02:06:32.189 --> 02:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
the VA or some academic Medical Center
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
or some hospital system like who pays
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
your check because the problem is is
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
once they flood the boards for these
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
Hospital associations and medical
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
associations uh they they follow the
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
party line and they create exactly what
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a board that is
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
that is self U
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
self-interested um so that's one of the
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
things that I think is important and
 
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
that that has happened over
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
time other thing that's happened is I
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
think medical schools need to be uh
 
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
teaching Physicians how to run a
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
practice uh that's the other thing is a
 
02:07:07.709 --> 02:07:07.719 align:start position:0%
lot of these older Physicians the reason
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
that they're selling to hospitals is
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
because the people that are coming out
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
of medical school they don't know which
 
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
way is up when it comes to a balance
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
sheet um and so medical schools are
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for preparing Physicians to
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
practice in the the state that
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're that they're they're going to
 
02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
practice and part of practicing is being
 
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
able to exist as an entity meaning you
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
know have a have a clinic and have
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
availability if we make a bunch of
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
doctors and none of them can open a
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
clinic it's not very useful um so that's
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
another thing that I think is important
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
I think hospitals are being bought
 
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
bought up I think uh Even in our own
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
State UAB just purchased all the
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
Catholic Hospitals uh now literally
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're you know went from six different
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Systems to
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
two there was no discussion about there
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
being any kind of uh Monopoly power
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
there and you know less Choice less
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
competition equals worse outcomes for
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
true um just to go along with that uh we
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
just had a discussion in this committee
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
uh believe it was last two weeks ago or
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
that power politics and money played a
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
huge role in
 
02:08:26.719 --> 02:08:28.350 align:start position:0%
huge role in
Co

02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
Co
 
02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.870 align:start position:0%
Co
um

02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
and the question is is how do we get
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
around that in the next pandemic so that
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
um different voices come to the table um
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
does it just because you have a
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
different idea or a different opinion
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
dissenting but as a physician and as uh
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
an internist and someone who wants to
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
look at all data um in your profession
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
would it be beneficial to have different
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
ideas and opinions around a table um
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
would you would you come up with a
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
better solution um whereas it looks like
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
when it came to the whether we did the
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
MRNA or the novax uh one factor was
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
benefit monetarily uh that's not really
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
a to me that's pretty biased um but
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
having different opinions yeah two
 
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
things on that one even talking about
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
novaa and mRNA there are other vaccines
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
there's attenuated vaccines that are
 
02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
available from India there's a Europe
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know coaxin they they're not
 
02:09:40.589 --> 02:09:40.599 align:start position:0%
available in the US and you know
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough uh Tony fouchy was
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
on TV uh talking to an Indian reporter
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
from India and uh um he said we don't
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
need your vac
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
we've got the
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
best that's fine if he thinks that but
 
02:09:59.950 --> 02:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's not um you know in a broader
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
Market especially people that may at the
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
time if he really cared about
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinating larger swats of the
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
population and he knew there was
 
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
resistance to a new
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
technology as a public health person you
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
should want all comers if you believe in
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
what you believe but it showed his bias
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
really quickly um because you know again
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is assuming that the vaccines
 
02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:26.599 align:start position:0%
worked and uh there was 15% of the
 
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
population that didn't want to get an
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccine because it was a new
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
technology well why are you rejecting
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
India's or the European Union's vaccine
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
that's live attenuated vaccine makes no
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
sense but that's what we did so again
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
money power and
 
02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
politics um what was the other question
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
um during you know we discussed that you
 
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
know during another pandemic we didn't
 
02:10:59.950 --> 02:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
look like different voices were brought
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
in yeah I I do think that um classically
 
02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
when you think about medicine medicine
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
is very siloed it's very specialized
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
there are very few people that
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
understand the complexities of all the
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
things that are going around on them and
 
02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
in fact they're systematically getting
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
rid of them because they make them where
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
you know you're not even you don't get
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
paid much to be somebody who thinks you
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
get paid to do um but it requires uh you
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
know multiple people not just the
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
experts that are the infectious disease
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
doctors that have no understanding they
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't even run their own practice about
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
about anything that has to do with
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
economics or running business or how
 
02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
that affect um I think you have to bring
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
all players involved in every aspect of
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
your decision and I think uh the uh
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
Medical Board also needs
 
02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.790 align:start position:0%
Medical Board also needs
to

02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
again encourage Physicians to try and be
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
involved not discourage them to do
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything other than what we tell you and
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
so that again that sometimes that's just
 
02:12:06.030 --> 02:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the organizations
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
themselves but at the legislature
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint having a bunch of infectious
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
disease doctors or some super specialist
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
come in and talk about
 
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
covid really is very is not useful when
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about what to do about it if the
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
if if it is how do we treat it what
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
medicines should we use that's fine
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's his expertise what you
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
should do about it from a societal
 
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint in terms of how we run
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
businesses if you're asking him that
 
02:12:35.549 --> 02:12:35.559 align:start position:0%
question you're getting the worst answer
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
available and that's what we
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
did I agree with you I mean we learned
 
02:12:44.549 --> 02:12:44.559 align:start position:0%
early on um that how important an
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
industrial uh hygienist would have been
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to helping mitigate a lot
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
of this um I never even knew that when
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
there was such a person out there um but
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
um so it's things the little things like
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
that that we're learning on this
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee that I think can make a big
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
impact in the future knowing that there
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
are other players that have different
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
expertise in different areas um to say
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
hey look have you looked at this have
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
you looked at that um and there and if
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
you look at even in the lay public I
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
mean beyond what you know my in my world
 
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
was Healthcare delivery like how do do I
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
take care of these patients both on the
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
chronic side but how do I also get
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
patients in early figure out what's
 
02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:28.599 align:start position:0%
going on and get them treated I mean
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
those are simple things to even but that
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't even discussed right uh but
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
additionally I mean people were solving
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
things from air filtration to I mean
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
there were engineers I mean there was a
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
lot of downtime for a lot of smart
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
people and we kind of wasted it they all
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
probably I meaning you know instead of
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
instead of inviting uh you know
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
Solutions we basically well these guys
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
know everything and you know we'll just
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
wait for Lord fouchy to tell us what to
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
do I I I think that um and as was
 
02:14:03.069 --> 02:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
discussed in this committee that we've
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
created not only we created a lot of
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
fear but a lot of distrust and we need
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to build that trust
 
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
back up uh with the public yeah I think
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
there was a a jamama piece again it's
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Jamma we're just talking about the
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
peerreview process but the trust in your
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
physician has dropped from 71% to 40% in
 
02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.149 align:start position:0%
physician has dropped from 71% to 40% in
3

02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
3
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
years that is I mean to have that kind
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
of drop you know people trusting their
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
own physician 71% of people did that to
 
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
40% and this was jama's own entities
 
02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
asking those questions so they're going
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
to try to be probably a little bit Pro
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
by you know you just think they would be
 
02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
that that is doesn't doesn't bode well
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the health of so we have a lot of
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
other problems I mean I think even
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
currently with uh with a lot of looking
 
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
at metabolic disease Ultra processed
 
02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
foods those kind of things I mean we
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
need to look at how we're
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
already being being treated uh and the
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
other argument I'd have in terms of the
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
consolidation of Hospital Systems has it
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
resulted in a healthier
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
Society or are people getting sicker the
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
more that we you know the health systems
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
become bought up the pharmaceutical
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
industry becomes more involved in the
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
FDA and the FDA you know I mean to me
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
the trend lines are all you know I guess
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
we could blame it on the American
 
02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
population you know too but it seems
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
like the people that matter that you
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
would hope are the people that are
 
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
solving problems and making people
 
02:15:41.229 --> 02:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
job I wouldn't disagree um but when
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about statistics there was
 
02:15:49.629 --> 02:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
something that we talked about earlier
 
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
and I just had a question
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
um when you're dealing with long covid
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
and vaccine injury is there a
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
correlation between long covid and those
 
02:15:59.549 --> 02:15:59.559 align:start position:0%
that were
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated yes could you expound on that
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit for me so there are plenty
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
of people that know the time date and
 
02:16:11.069 --> 02:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
place that they got vaccinated and were
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
different um and so they have this
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
almost time or may they have this moment
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
in time that they they know um long
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
covid seems to be more you know
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
developed after they got covid even a
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot of them didn't really have many
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
viral symptoms but 2 to 8 weeks later uh
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
started to notice they didn't think the
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
same they couldn't run like they thought
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
they could they have other palpitations
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
so it is it is interesting to find that
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
the vaccine seems to be much more Moment
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
In Time temporal versus the long Co
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
seems to be developing kind of in this a
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more um it's not subtle I
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's still pretty Dynamic but it's
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
not it's not associated it was some
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
temporal change um I try in my practice
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I know their long Co
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
symptoms when they got long covid every
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
time they got infected and every time
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
they had a vaccine you know it's almost
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
like I wanted to come up with kind of a
 
02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
you know an acronym in uh in gy or OB is
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
looking at like pregnancies delibery you
 
02:17:16.830 --> 02:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
know like you have these you know uh we
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
need to have like a covid 3 injection
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
for you know like a because it it does
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
matter it's cumulative so um I guess so
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a numbers person so and I don't know
 
02:17:32.190 --> 02:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
this would be very subjective on your
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
part but of the population that you're
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
seeing with long covid uh what is the
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
say the percentage that NE have long Co
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
that weren't vaccinated and those that
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
have long Co that were vaccinated is
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
there this about about 15% have never
 
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated and so 85%
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
you that that's a pretty telling number
 
02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:05.950 align:start position:0%
you that that's a pretty telling number
um

02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
and and I will say in my state with the
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
state if you want to just look at
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
statistics a state that the vaccine
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
uptake was probably less than 50 less
 
02:18:15.399 --> 02:18:16.469 align:start position:0%
uptake was probably less than 50 less
than

02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
60% that's way out of proportion you
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
know in in a state that maybe had 85% of
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
people and you you could say that
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
there's but in a state like mine where
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh vaccine uptake was low much lower to
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
have it to have that high of a rate is
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
is means means
 
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
something um I'm gonna oh let me put out
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
a question um not sure how much longer I
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have a time limit that
 
02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
you have to leave uh we can break for
 
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
lunch or we can just keep on going it's
 
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
your preference we can just keep on
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
going I guess yeah okay represent po
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
off thank you Madame chair and thank you
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my other question uh uh are
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
you aware about uh some new data about
 
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
sv40 uh that some of those plasmids used
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
in covid vaccines had um some uh gen
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
sequence that uh can act as a cancer
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
promoter and
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
if uh if that an issue is it an issue
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
only for one specific manufacturer or is
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
it common for
 
02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.629 align:start position:0%
it common for
allna

02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
allna
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines do you know so sv40 is a common
 
02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
promoter sequence for them to actually
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
make uh RNA and DNA um there is as you
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's lots of debate on if it's
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually something that has uh cancer or
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
actually is able to assist even
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
genetic changes to get up to the
 
02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
nucleus um it is another example because
 
02:19:58.830 --> 02:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
actually until it was pointed out by
 
02:20:01.309 --> 02:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
Kevin mckernin who's a who's an actual
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
big geneticist historically at MIT that
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
it existed it wasn't part of the actual
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
um it was not part of the uh filing like
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to con yeah yeah
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
their licensing application but once it
 
02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
was pointed out they added it quickly
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
and said oh we always knew it was there
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
well if you always knew it was there
 
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
why'd you leave it
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
out um I think that it is concerning it
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
goes back to again it's not my area of
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
expertise but uh the manufacturing
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
process that I talked about that
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
typically the manufacturing process for
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
these things was on a very small batch
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
using a pretty time intensive process um
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
but when you roll rolled it out to
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
billions of doses uh you had to change
 
02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
on the Fly and I'm not sure that they
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
had uh perfected their process and
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
contaminants as a chemical engineer you
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
know you know it takes a long time to
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
perfect you yes I uh in the in the 990s
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
I worked with Dr sulk on a a analogy for
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
HIV using the polio approach that he
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
used and uh we we did cell culture batch
 
02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
small cell cult culture batches to grow
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
HIV which we then inactivated and used
 
02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
Freud's adant to as a vaccine as a
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
prototype that he attempted uh that was
 
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unsuccessful but had uh I
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
think it did a lot to further the
 
02:21:37.469 --> 02:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
science and the understanding of what
 
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
HIV was doing in the population at that
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
time so it was it
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
was good mechanisms for science um I I
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually did have a a question um with
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
regard to to natural immunity and covid
 
02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
what what have you seen uh so I I myself
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just share a brief personal
 
02:22:03.309 --> 02:22:03.319 align:start position:0%
testimony is that I had covid uh my
 
02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
oxygen levels went down um I had not
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated and I had to be
 
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalized I was in um ICU for nine
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
days and hospital for 14 days and and
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
um uh fortunately was not put on a
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
ventilator um and immediately uh after
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
that is someone was Physicians were
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
suggesting oh you should get vaccinated
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I said what happened to natural
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
immunity um and so I do you have some
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
comments on on that two two things
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
one yeah when when Physicians were
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
saying that and actually Thomas massie's
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
um phone calls with some of the FDA
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
people recently showed you they had no
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
evidence on actually getting the vaccine
 
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
after you had had co uh and in fact to
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
say that would be safe and effective is
 
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
completely Russian roulette meaning you
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
they had no data you were actually
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
excluded from The Trial if you had
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
previously had Co which I you know makes
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
sense if you're trying to do a trial um
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
um the uh the interesting thing and this
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
is really more inside baseball just
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
talking to Dr Redfield the interest so
 
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:25.070 align:start position:0%
talking to Dr Redfield the interest so
up

02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
until up until really Omron I mean I had
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
a I had a patient base of about 7,000
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
antibodies I had I had the machine
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
basically that orthol clinical makes
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that could tell me uh what your Sero
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
positivity in your serot titer was and
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
so I just ran I have my own Reference
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
Lab which again goes back to how
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
interesting I am um but
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh I maybe had one person that had out
 
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
of that 7,000 that had been
 
02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.590 align:start position:0%
of that 7,000 that had been
reinfected

02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
reinfected
 
02:23:58.269 --> 02:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
um maybe two I mean it was counting them
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
on on you know fingers
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay which is one of the reasons that I
 
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
started to question the Orthodoxy even
 
02:24:08.110 --> 02:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
more because that was not what was being
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
told you know people can get infected
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
their antibodies Wayne No One antibodies
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
Wan they doubled every three months um
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
so it was like completely it was like
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
they were just stating something that
 
02:24:20.349 --> 02:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
was either they had never investigated
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
or they knew was
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
untrue um but then Omron came along and
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
Omron that's a whole different story on
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
probably how Omron anyway still don't
 
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
know totally about Omron it's this
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
totally different lineage it's nothing
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
to do with previous uh SARS Co 2
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
infections just appears out of nowhere
 
02:24:41.070 --> 02:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
in November of 20 uh
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
22 um but it revealed not only kids got
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
infected but also everybody that had
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
gotten covid previously started getting
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
infected um with so natural immunity in
 
02:24:58.990 --> 02:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
this it does matter that you've had Co
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
but one of the ways the spike protein
 
02:25:03.790 --> 02:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
was manipulated and that could be
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
something that you could discuss but uh
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
was they tried to make the spike protein
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
in a way that it did not um alert or
 
02:25:15.389 --> 02:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
activate your inate immune system okay
 
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
so your inate immune system is kind of
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
like your alarm system for the body and
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
again this comes from just kind of
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
knowing what they were trying to do in
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
the lab uh and so when you downregulate
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
that innate immune response uh you're
 
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
kind of your alarm is shut off and so
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
your alarm system doesn't work well and
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it makes it really hard for the
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
natural immune processes to actually
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
work your protective immune responses
 
02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
which are a lot dependent on your innate
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
immune system so it's just unique and
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
again even how they glycosilated the
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
spike meaning like the sugars and it it
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
makes it very hard for the body to find
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
of and Dr Redfield will tell you about
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
where the alanines are on each of the
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
that's not that's beyond my expertise
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
but it's interesting how they changed up
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
the domains that would have interacted
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
and actually um had an immune response
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah but uh
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
so I'm almost shocked because as science
 
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
you don't know what the outcome for that
 
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
will be you can't know what the outcome
 
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
for that would be so you're you're
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
putting something in that has
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
no evidence to
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
support a knowable long-term effect yeah
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and we we still I mean again that study
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
didn't look at long-term effects I think
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably Aon Siri probably gave you all
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
a schooling on how long actually people
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
follow follow up after vaccines you know
 
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's not what we
 
02:26:58.510 --> 02:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
think uh you mentioned the Omron which
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
is like was a different variant variant
 
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the SARS 2 um and that a lot of
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
people were Contracting that that it
 
02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:07.790 align:start position:0%
people were Contracting that that it
already

02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
had covid why what made that variant
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
different and um well when you think
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
about natural immunity and then how a
 
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
virus mutates over time you know the
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
more likely it is to the virus that you
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
had the more likely you probably have
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
immune you know activity that can a will
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
help you prevent from getting it um when
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
you have something that has a totally
 
02:27:32.319 --> 02:27:33.070 align:start position:0%
you have something that has a totally
different

02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
so when you say totally different
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
lineage me had no it had it had nothing
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
Luhan it appeared as you all remember it
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
supposedly appeared in South
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
Africa in November or October
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
um there's an interesting paper and
 
02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
again I can I can give this to the
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee um that the closest thing that
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
that SARS Cove to uh in terms of they're
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're able to run genetics and look at
 
02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
protein structure and how it interacts
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
with uh different mammals
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the most recent thing that it
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
appeared that it had interacted with was
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
mus muscularis which is a a lab Mouse um
 
02:28:33.309 --> 02:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
and so like meaning everything about it
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
like that was the most recent species to
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
to interact with it if that makes sense
 
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
so again I'm not saying we know that for
 
02:28:43.469 --> 02:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
sure but it was an interesting paper uh
 
02:28:43.479 --> 02:28:44.670 align:start position:0%
sure but it was an interesting paper uh
representative

02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and I I
 
02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
caught a little something there I'd like
 
02:28:52.030 --> 02:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
to drill down on just to to see if I'm
 
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly because it's
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
thought I've had
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
before obviously the weight of the
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
evidence would now suggest that covid-19
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
original strain was not a naturally
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
occurring virus but rather something
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
that very much appears again the weight
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the evidence to have been developed
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
at a uh Chinese military laboratory in
 
02:29:18.030 --> 02:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
Wuhan with the input and perhaps funding
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the NIH through intermediary Eco
 
02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
Health Alliance who has now been
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
sanctioned by the federal government um
 
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
for withholding
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
information uh are you suggesting now
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
based on some of this genetic analysis
 
02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
done that there was a strain that came
 
02:29:39.269 --> 02:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
about sometime during the pandemic that
 
02:29:39.279 --> 02:29:40.429 align:start position:0%
about sometime during the pandemic that
was

02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
sufficiently genetically dissimilar to
 
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
anything else that was out there at the
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
time that it might suggest a secondary
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory release
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
so it is it's a possibility I mean the
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
other thing that they
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
stated around that time you'll remember
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
that they were say it's probably in some
 
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
HIV patient that never cleared the virus
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
and made mutations and I don't know if
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
y'all maybe you probably didn't read the
 
02:30:07.469 --> 02:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
stuff that the literature that uh
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
meaning because everyone would they're
 
02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
still dumb bounded on like why a virus
 
02:30:15.070 --> 02:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden appears with no previous
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
history to a pre so I mean that is that
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
is one of the possibilities that there a
 
02:30:24.030 --> 02:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
that something else was new I mean
 
02:30:26.349 --> 02:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
because it is new when you look at you
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
know look at its relation to the
 
02:30:28.359 --> 02:30:30.670 align:start position:0%
know look at its relation to the
previous

02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
virus follow up thank you madam chair
 
02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
and just to dispel for anybody who's
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
watching that may sound like a crazy
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
question but given the modern technology
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
for things like Gene
 
02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
editing is it really that crazy to
 
02:30:48.429 --> 02:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
suggest that there could have been some
 
02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
secondary playing around with this virus
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
at some point along the
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
way not at all I mean I
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
think the more we learn about what labs
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
are doing with gain of function the more
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
we need
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
to crack down on
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
it um in response to your patients that
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
maybe had the original covid and then
 
02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
the Omicron did you notice a difference
 
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
in symptoms oh yeah yeah I mean the
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
Omicron was definitely much more um at
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
least at that time and still is less
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
thrombogenic less platelet activating
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
symptoms seem to stay mostly in the orox
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
so throat um and uh you know it did not
 
02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
cause the crazy chest x-ray changes that
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:46.269 --> 02:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
Delta having had both um I noticed a
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
huge difference
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
between how my body was with one versus
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
the other um so
 
02:31:59.230 --> 02:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
um that may explain I think uh why there
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
was such a huge difference um thank you
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
represent PO is
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
off thank you did you have any cases
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
when you had uh to send your patients
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
into for example hospital system and did
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
you have any input on followup
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
treatments and uh any you feedback and
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
so so yes so um when we talk about home
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
oxygen uh the European respiratory
 
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
Society at that time had had a uh
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
article that was talking about what we
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
call permissive
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
hypoxemia um which is a fancy term for
 
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
saying you know typically in medicine we
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know your SATs getting the 80s we
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
were were scared but interestingly
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
enough in Co it seems like these people
 
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
could hang out in the 60s and 70s and
 
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm not giving any medical advice
 
02:32:55.269 --> 02:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
here I'm just kind of telling you and it
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh but they would be fine actually if as
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
long as they would sit there they were
 
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen though is
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
eventually if their lungs didn't recover
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
they would start to wear out so work of
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
breathing can be very tiring um and so
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
if the work of breathing tired out I did
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
have to admit them but we would admit
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
them to a place that could do eemo um
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
where cuz the last thing we want to do
 
02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
is beat up their lungs cuz the lungs are
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
the problem um so ECMO uh you know was
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
the primary therapy now that wasn't it
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
was a salvage therapy in the hospital um
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
realm meaning after they'd beat the
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
lungs up on the ventilator for two weeks
 
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
they'd throw them on ECMO um but I've
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of patients that actually
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's why they survived was emmo the
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
other thing is interesting a number of
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
my patients that survived got apib and
 
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
they got put on uh a blood thinner um
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know so it was almost like thank God
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
you got apib while you're in the
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
hospital because you got the treatment
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
that you needed to get um which is again
 
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
these are just you know stories from the
 
02:33:58.590 --> 02:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
people that I've taken care of but yeah
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
two two people like that uh one passed
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
survived now one of the things that we
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
talked about and because you own a
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
practice um is health care worker
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
shortage um are you seeing that in your
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
practice Yeah I mean it's hard it's it's
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
hard to get good people at the time also
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard to keep good people because uh
 
02:34:33.150 --> 02:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
some of the payment structures and most
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
of the hospital systems are currently
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
paying for that right now because they
 
02:34:38.910 --> 02:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
were doing out of state nursing paying
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
three times the labor cost that they you
 
02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
know and now they're all like we don't
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
have any money well you also stole all
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
the people that I uh because you could
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
pay them three times more because you
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
were getting so yes it is an issue um
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
but uh but what I it was interesting in
 
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
my cohort again I think this goes back
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
to why having a family company a small
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
practice is my uh my employees I kind of
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
look at as my second family and so you
 
02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
know well my goal was to take care of
 
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
them throughout all this and that's what
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
we did and because I was willing to take
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
care of them I don't know because but I
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
think because I was willing to take care
 
02:35:19.469 --> 02:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
of them they were willing to work and
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
and and stay and help so um what um in
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaking with different people and I
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
just spoke with someone on Tuesday who
 
02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
was a first responder um in the in the
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
state and she was either told because
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't take the vaccine to either
 
02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory retirement or they would uh
 
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
terminate her fire
 
02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
her um and then also at our County
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
levels um if because of the Medicaid
 
02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:51.790 align:start position:0%
levels um if because of the Medicaid
Medicare

02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
dollars um if you refused the vaccine
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
you were no longer employed yeah um and
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
do you think uh and so these people have
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
gone on to other things in their lives
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't think are coming back into
 
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
the healthcare system do you think that
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
created part of our issues it didn't
 
02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:14.269 align:start position:0%
created part of our issues it didn't
help

02:36:14.269 --> 02:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it was interesting still
 
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
even if you look back at the the oan
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
mandate the medical provider mandate the
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
HHS mandate that all came out in
 
02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:26.710 align:start position:0%
HHS mandate that all came out in
September

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
September
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
2021 um the only one that I think held
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
up which is crazy in the Supreme Court
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
was the healthcare worker
 
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
mandate which I thought was ironic
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
because wouldn't it be the healthcare
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
workers the doctors and other people
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
that might be able to make the best
 
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves on whether they
 
02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
need to be vaccinated or not again these
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
are people that defer to The Experts
 
02:36:50.670 --> 02:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
right you know it was just that the OSHA
 
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
the OSHA part didn't hold up and then I
 
02:36:54.750 --> 02:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
forgot what the other one was but uh
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's the med they they
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
attached it to your payment from
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare if you were in a hospital
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
system um I
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
think I don't know if that's still um
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
law I I don't I don't think it's it is
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
um at the moment I don't think it's um
 
02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
one of the issues but I know even at the
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
county level uh contractors are
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
subcontractors couldn't go in unless
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
they were vaccinated so they're actually
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um is there any advice that you
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
would impart to this committee as we
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh look at what we can do better in the
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
next pandemic we know that the next
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic will be different um the virus
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is is going to look
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
different in your professional
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
opinion what do you think should happen
 
02:38:02.429 --> 02:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
at the state
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
levels um to
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
prevent um so that we can do better next
 
02:38:11.309 --> 02:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
time to make sure all stakeholders are
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the table that all voices are being
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
heard that Biologicals are an option and
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-sized fits-all because
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're all
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
different yeah I think I think freeing
 
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
up Physicians to be able to do what they
 
02:38:29.790 --> 02:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
think is right um and if they get any
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
push back making sure they are
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
represented correctly that they're doing
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
the right thing meaning if they get
 
02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
fired by the hospital having you know
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
avenues for for that uh the other thing
 
02:38:43.710 --> 02:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
is just I think the structure of most of
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
these Health authorities was never
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
evaluated because they never thought
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that a health authority would become the
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
authoritarian uh monster that uh they
 
02:38:57.389 --> 02:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
became and so there's a lot of states
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't even know that the person in
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
charge of whether you could open your
 
02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant was something somebody you
 
02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't fire and your legislators and
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
Governor couldn't do anything about
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
either and that is a recipe for disaster
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
so anybody with the authority to shut
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
down your freedoms has to be held
 
02:39:20.269 --> 02:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
accountable in every way of structuring
 
02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.750 --> 02:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.550 --> 02:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure we'll think of
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
Plenty um but Dr Von I can't tell you
 
02:39:41.469 --> 02:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
how much uh I I think we all appreciate
 
02:39:44.429 --> 02:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
you being here and the information that
 
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
you have given us
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
um wow um and some of the data uh I
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important for us to hear this
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
information and to get it out to our
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
citizens so that they can understand
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
that there are people that understand
 
02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
and are out there that um know what's
 
02:40:05.230 --> 02:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
going on uh especially in the terms of
 
02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh long Co and vaccine injury um and
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get more people in this
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
state involved in that um to give these
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
people help um we've had parents in here
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
testifying and showing us pictures of
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
their children
 
02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
um it's horrific yeah um it's it's it's
 
02:40:28.990 --> 02:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually it's heartbreaking um so thank
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
you again so much for being here I
 
02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:33.880 align:start position:0%

04:32:40.840 --> 04:33:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.760 --> 04:33:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.719 --> 04:34:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.719 --> 04:34:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.639 --> 04:35:10.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.639 --> 04:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
so uh the doctor Dr uh V runs a large
 
04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
Private Practice um overseas I believe
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
he said about 200 other Physicians uh
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
focusing largely on uh
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
Co acute long covid
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
and also vaccine injuries and effects
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
and he has an awful lot of um awful lot
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
of experience I believe I believe he
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
said that they've treated cumulatively
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
about 200,000 patients
 
04:37:01.470 --> 04:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
um he's uh has a lot of experience
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
Beyond just I don't mean to say just
 
04:37:05.629 --> 04:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
being a doctor but beyond being a
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
physician he's also has his a degree in
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
engineering um he is obviously a
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
businessman having running all that
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and he's also has experience he's
 
04:37:21.429 --> 04:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
testified before Congress um
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh he's out of
 
04:37:29.629 --> 04:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
Alabama yep yep down south um so it it
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
was very nice bit of testimony
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
um actually most of it was just question
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
and answer we we had an awful lot of
 
04:37:40.349 --> 04:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
questions about a whole broad range of
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
of subjects
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and it it was very very interesting
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
um now whether there was a lot of brand
 
04:37:49.160 --> 04:37:50.269 align:start position:0%
um now whether there was a lot of brand
new

04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:37:52.750 --> 04:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
material I think a lot of it was sort of
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
stuff we've at least tangentially heard
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
from other people as well um but
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
nonetheless uh it was it was very
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
interesting very
 
04:38:01.000 --> 04:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
interesting very
informative

off uh thank you Madame
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
04:43:43.150 --> 04:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
so just to open the discussion so uh I
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
think our report should uh cover
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
different topics that we discussed
 
04:43:51.628 --> 04:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
before as priorities uh for committee
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
like we were discussing effect on
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
education and
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh so and also if
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
possible um uh I think uh it would be
 
04:44:08.948 --> 04:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
nice to document again who were people
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of our Comm Mee uh
 
04:44:15.150 --> 04:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
and also I don't know if it's possible
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
but if possible to outline what uh
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
documents were submitted uh to for the
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
record of the committee so uh to have it
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.030 --> 04:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
report um I think that's that's good um
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
some of the documents I mean I don't
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
think we can attach them um all of them
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
to the uh report because I think uh it
 
04:44:46.990 --> 04:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
would be too many um represent pull off
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah even not attaching but
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
just mentioning the nature of the
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
document or name of a document name of
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
an article or uh some uh executive order
 
04:45:01.470 --> 04:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
or something else that was
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
submitted so did um I think you
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me that um the researcher
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
sort of gave you a format for the
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
outline for this sort of report uh yes
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
and I can forward that off to everyone
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
she gave me
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh like a memorandum and then an example
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
of a report and I can send that off to
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
the entire committee uh I'll do that
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
right as we before we leave tonight yeah
 
04:45:30.270 --> 04:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
I mean usually they do exactly what you
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
said representative they say what our
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
mission was they say how many meetings
 
04:45:37.948 --> 04:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
we had who the people were I mean we're
 
04:45:40.150 --> 04:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to have our own website right so
 
04:45:42.430 --> 04:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
we can link to the website for a lot of
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
the documentation and if there's
 
04:45:47.230 --> 04:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
specific documentation you want to call
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
out we can we can mention that um I
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
think the challenge may be what you were
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
just just what categories we want to
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
talk about within the report because we
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
heard an awful lot of information and
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
some of it is within the purview of the
 
04:46:07.390 --> 04:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
state and others of it isn't so I don't
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
know uh representative beler said he had
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of reports he wanted to discuss
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
that said represent thank you m
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
chair the ones I have seen so far
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
the part that we need to focus on is the
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
findings of the committee and then what
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
are the recommendations of the committee
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
um those should not be
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
really robust as per se they should be
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
more of a short narrative succinctly
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
said and then at that point in time you
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
can go into what it is that you want
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
like you said all the attachments and
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
documentation that we went through but I
 
04:46:45.310 --> 04:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
think key to it is going to be what are
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
the what are the findings we have what
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
you going call them bullet points and
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time what are the
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I would like to have
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the committee focus on what are the key
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
findings not every finding but the key
 
04:47:00.750 --> 04:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
ones that we all can agree on and then
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
what are the recommendations that we
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
have based upon the
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
findings I I think one of the key
 
04:47:09.948 --> 04:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
findings that we found was um in regards
 
04:47:12.270 --> 04:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the information that was
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
filtered down to the state came from the
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
federal government um and as we
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
know the state could only act on what
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
they were being
 
04:47:28.680 --> 04:47:30.708 align:start position:0%
they were being
fed

04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
fed
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is and we
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
discussed that a lot of fear was
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
instilled into the populace and uh what
 
04:47:41.310 --> 04:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
steps can the state take take in the
 
04:47:45.400 --> 04:47:45.410 align:start position:0%
future to mitigate some of that
 
04:47:45.410 --> 04:47:47.110 align:start position:0%
future to mitigate some of that
[Music]

04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
um because you're being bombarded on a
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
day-to-day level and I think that that
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
plays a Hu played a huge factor into the
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
whole uh pandemic and turned families
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
against family members
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
and people against people and we have to
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
remember that we're all
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
we were all we were all in this together
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and even though we may have different
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
opinions doesn't mean one was right and
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
one was
 
04:48:22.990 --> 04:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
wrong but and then you know when we
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
listened to the honorable Betty gay she
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
said you know you know she had some
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
different ideas but bringing different
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh ideas together to get to the so
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
everyone can understand everyone else's
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint and maybe one is better you
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
know one is making more sense and one's
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
not as rational but it to dismiss people
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
is not really um people need to feel
 
04:48:52.510 --> 04:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
valued and heard I I concur I would say
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
that a couple of things I've taken away
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and you hit upon one of those and that
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the fact there was the Federal
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
Government a lot of the information came
 
04:49:03.548 --> 04:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
from the federal government as a state
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources to reinvent
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
the wheel so we have to take on face
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
value what the federal government is
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
providing for information information
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
secondly I would say the issue comes
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
down to is how much State Control versus
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
local control and do we at this point in
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
time have a very very strong State
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
control or do we somehow again the state
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
becomes the vehicle to bring the
 
04:49:28.750 --> 04:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
information from the federal level down
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the local level and that's the
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
tension between the state control versus
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
local control and then the other part I
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
would say is to you really hit upon the
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
nail it's the Fear Factor and what is up
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
happening is
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
and this is not the state when I say the
 
04:49:45.788 --> 04:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
state it's us in this room right here we
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
had competing narratives we it became
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
politicized and it was like my narrative
 
04:49:55.150 --> 04:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
is more correct than your narrative no
 
04:49:56.910 --> 04:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
my narrative is more correct than your
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
narrative so we had competing narratives
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
that are out there which to your point
 
04:50:05.548 --> 04:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
tore families apart to our friendships
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
apart because people didn't know which
 
04:50:10.270 --> 04:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
narrative so if I was going to look at
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
it in hindsight we should have all got
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
together and had a narrative and not
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
have competing narratives so that's my
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
take on it and and thank you for saying
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
that and um but that's what this rep
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
this committee is here for right is to
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
see okay this this is what happened we
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
can do better next time and next time we
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what the pandemic's going to
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
be or how it's going to react it's going
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh but um I I think you know that's I
 
04:50:51.788 --> 04:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
think we have to approach that and recog
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
at least we're we in this committee are
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
sitting down recognizing some of the
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
issues and we can sit here and talk
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
about them and I think that hopefully
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
the public can see that we can do that
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
um nicely and you
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
are doesn't mean one person's right and
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
one person's wrong and I I think that's
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
really important represent yeah I mean I
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
do too so I was just sort of thinking
 
04:51:24.510 --> 04:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
about this because I've written a few of
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
these reports and I'm not volunteering
 
04:51:29.548 --> 04:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
to write this um but the a lot of the
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
findings can be like some really basic
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
stuff like I I uh think uh Trisha Tilly
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
came in she had a timeline right I think
 
04:51:41.590 --> 04:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
the timeline would be really helpful to
 
04:51:45.310 --> 04:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
have included in the report um uh and
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
that way we our findings don't have to
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
be the list of events and then you know
 
04:51:53.230 --> 04:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we can build to some extent about
 
04:51:55.150 --> 04:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
that but you know one of our findings
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
can be um unfortunately through the
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic the the um the
 
04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
discourse became very uh polarized and
 
04:52:09.750 --> 04:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
polarizing um and you know then a
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation can be you know I don't
 
04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
know how you solve that but to really
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
work harder on messaging that is not
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
politicized and polarizing and more and
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
more unified I mean that's sort of how
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
you can break it up I I mean yeah I mean
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's easy for us to say this now because
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here playing the quarter
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know right but we can have but we
 
04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
can have that as a finding and then we
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
can because I I mean if I'm remembering
 
04:52:42.750 --> 04:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
I watched the live stream from uh Dr
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
Chan that was one of the things that he
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
pointed to so unfortunately we haven't
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
really had somebody here to present the
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
homeland security report but I'm sure
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
there are some things in there that just
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
when we're doing our report it's going
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
to sound familiar to us so um but
 
04:53:03.670 --> 04:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's there must be other things that
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
we can say representative weary then
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yeah just just a
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
comment I think um I think the point
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
about conflicting narratives is good but
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
I think that it goes uh further than
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
that and that we were getting
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
conflicting data and so I think you you
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
know we I think we're fairly rational
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
people here in New Hampshire and we tend
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
to form good rational decisions um but I
 
04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
think when we were getting conflicting
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
data and not uh kind of testing that and
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
sourcing it out I think that let that's
 
04:53:40.590 --> 04:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
what ultimately led to the the
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting narratives if I you know
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's my perception um you know I I I'm
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
a chemical engineer I've done a lot of
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
process investigations where there's
 
04:53:54.750 --> 04:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
something messed up and you know what
 
04:53:54.760 --> 04:53:56.350 align:start position:0%
something messed up and you know what
what

04:53:56.350 --> 04:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
what invariably happens is someone has
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
made an assumption about something and
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
they've marched off in that direction
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
because of that and until you you know
 
04:54:08.590 --> 04:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
stop everybody slow them down and get
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
them say well how how did you know that
 
04:54:13.628 --> 04:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
was accurate you what how are you
 
04:54:16.030 --> 04:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
assured that that data is correct then
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
you you can't really do a proper
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
investigation you can't make proper
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
decisions following that so I I your
 
04:54:24.030 --> 04:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
point is well taken but I I think it it
 
04:54:26.110 --> 04:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
really goes deeper than that and I think
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge for New Hampshire
 
04:54:29.830 --> 04:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the future is sorting out what is
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
accurate data and what is
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
not I totally agree with that I would
 
04:54:34.798 --> 04:54:35.590 align:start position:0%
not I totally agree with that I would
say

04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to build a plane
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
while we're basically flying it
 
04:54:44.670 --> 04:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's a challenge I look back in
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Spanish Flu back in 1916 17 18 the
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
same issues we have today they had as
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
well and it comes back to the Fear
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
Factor it was again competing thoughts
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
back to competing data what people
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
thought was right versus wrong some
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
cities did it one way one city did it
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
another way it wasn't until after the
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
dust settled we go back and look at the
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
data in hindsight you said okay that
 
04:55:13.150 --> 04:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
prevailed and it made sense that didn't
 
04:55:15.070 --> 04:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
but when you're going through the air
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to build a plane at
 
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
the same time it's hard to sort through
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
the data I don't disagree that there is
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
competing data and the question at that
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
point in time is how do we somehow I
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
think take the competing data and not
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
turn it into supporting our competing
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
narratives and that's where I think it
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
came down to is somehow as a state and I
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we can do this
 
04:55:36.750 --> 04:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
because we also have the federal
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
government so the federal government we
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
don't live in an isolation
 
04:55:42.910 --> 04:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
so you had the federal government
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes you could have competing
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
narratives between the federal
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
government and the state government and
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
states so I what I'm trying to get to
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
is I think we did as best as we could
 
04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
however could we have done better in
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
some ways yes but I think that's what we
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
talk about the recommendations and the
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
findings is we had all this competing
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
data competing information if you will
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
we had uh society and people out there
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
looking to say which one do I believe
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
and that's so
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
hard I agree and the other thing is is
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
well we just had testimony this morning
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
from Dr Devon and then uh representative
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
beler as we were discussing uh he
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
someone did a study and prior to the
 
04:56:34.270 --> 04:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a 70% confidence rate
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
in Physicians he then said it was down
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
to 40% but as we were speaking represent
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
Bel you got a report that said it's at
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
31.7% people trust their
 
04:56:50.190 --> 04:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
doctors um and so we know that
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
the not only in the medical industry but
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
in government we've lost the trust of
 
04:57:00.270 --> 04:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
the people um and we need to gain that
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
trust back because if there's another
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic we can't have it can't be
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
Helter Skelter we need to make sure the
 
04:57:11.390 --> 04:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
people are going to trust what they're
 
04:57:15.070 --> 04:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and M chairman chair lady sorry
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
I would say it's probably one of the
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
most important takeaways from this is
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
that how do we get the trust back of the
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
voters citizens and people in our state
 
04:57:25.350 --> 04:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
because they look to us for guidance and
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
if they don't have that trust in us then
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have much to hang or hand
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
on I 100% agree with
 
04:57:34.510 --> 04:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:57:38.350 --> 04:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and uh on
 
04:57:41.628 --> 04:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
precisely that topic um one as I as I
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned there was a couple reports I
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss one of them came
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
across uh earlier and this was this was
 
04:57:47.920 --> 04:57:49.548 align:start position:0%
across uh earlier and this was this was
just

04:57:49.548 --> 04:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
released uh very recently this is a and
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
I sent it out via email as well this is
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
a a United States House House of
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives um report of findings
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
called we can do this an assessment of
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:58:09.788 --> 04:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
Services covid-19 Public Health campaign
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
and this this is looking specifically at
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
a messaging campaign that uh was
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
undertaken at a cost of more than $20
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
million per month uh by The Firm fors
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
Marsh group um on behalf of the
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:58:29.470 --> 04:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a lot of findings it's
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
a I don't expect you'll probably want to
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing it's 113 or
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
something pages long um but there's
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's some very interesting findings
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I I'd be happy to discuss some of
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
them in in in detail but the thrust of
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
it is that this report lays at the foot
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
of this particular firm um a messaging
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
campaign to the public that was not
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
keeping up with what was known
 
04:58:58.510 --> 04:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
scientifically at the time that the
 
04:59:01.628 --> 04:59:01.638 align:start position:0%
messaging was being done and as a result
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
caused a collapse in public confidence
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
in uh in in the government's sort of
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
role in in this representative Bel was
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
that at the federal level or state level
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes that was the Federal level Federal
 
04:59:19.070 --> 04:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:21.548 --> 04:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
you I mean I think as part of our
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
findings we really have to say that the
 
04:59:28.990 --> 04:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic caused panic and you know we
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
had agency person after agency person
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
come in and just say you know what a
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
difficult scenario it was for them and
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
they were really they were really
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
scrambling you know we were dealing with
 
04:59:45.868 --> 04:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
remote situation when we I mean now we
 
04:59:48.030 --> 04:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
take it for granted but it didn't really
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
exist at that time um and I mean I think
 
04:59:54.350 --> 04:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
the agency people were really doing the
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
best that they could do um but I think
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
our findings have to reflect the
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that existed especially in
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
the in the beginning of the pandemic I
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
think that's really um important
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
but if I was going to have a
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would say that our
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
Public Health uh you know system we
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
really have to I mean I don't I think
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
there was probably some standard
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
operating procedures in place for a
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic something like this but I think
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
that our systems really need to be tuned
 
05:00:36.590 --> 05:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
up and upgraded so that in a situation
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
like this if it comes up again we're not
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
scrambling like crazy I mean I assume
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
there are things in place but hopefully
 
05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
they'll reanalyze their systems and and
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
we'll be better prepared the next
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
time I mean I agree but I mean I also
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
think that you know in light of the fact
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
um we need to recognize
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
that depending on what area of Public
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
Health they're in you may need to bring
 
05:01:06.990 --> 05:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
in Engineers or industrial hygienist
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just you need to bring in other
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
areas because they're only looking at
 
05:01:17.070 --> 05:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
one aspect of it and there's many many
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
aspects of dealing with the pandemic and
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's important um you know just
 
05:01:24.430 --> 05:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
with uh Dr Chan being
 
05:01:29.310 --> 05:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
here La last week and I asked him about
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that we
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
heard that could have helped mitigate
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
things like almost immediately and
 
05:01:35.708 --> 05:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
schools and things was air filtration
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
and ventilation well yeah we didn't have
 
05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
the money for that well what is that but
 
05:01:42.750 --> 05:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
it still would be to me that would be
 
05:01:45.070 --> 05:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
under public health because you're
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
looking at mitigating a virus um but his
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
Department didn't really focus on that
 
05:01:57.270 --> 05:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
um according to what he his testimony
 
05:02:00.190 --> 05:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
was and correct me if I'm wrong um you
 
05:02:00.200 --> 05:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
was and correct me if I'm wrong um you
know

05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we need to bring in others
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
so that they can look at the different
 
05:02:09.150 --> 05:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
areas I mean I think that's great that's
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
one recommend ation that we say that the
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
response to that I mean and this may
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
even be in the homeland security report
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately our agencies have
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
worked in a sort of they they worked in
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
a sort of a siloed fashion and over time
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
they may have come together but any
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
response to a pandemic really has to be
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
an integrated one that brings in stuff
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
like what you were just saying and and
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I think there was an attempt
 
05:02:42.548 --> 05:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
to to do that but they should like have
 
05:02:44.548 --> 05:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
systems in place to make sure they do it
 
05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the future but funding of course is
 
05:02:47.120 --> 05:02:48.070 align:start position:0%
in the future but funding of course is
always

05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
always
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
really difficult well well of course
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
funding is always difficult and and the
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
thing is is you
 
05:02:58.350 --> 05:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
know no
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
one in this state should take lightly
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
what everybody in the departments were
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
going through at the time of the
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic that they were working hard and
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
had the best interests
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
of the state in mind I mean we have to
 
05:03:16.470 --> 05:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
be thankful for that um so we all have
 
05:03:16.480 --> 05:03:17.470 align:start position:0%
be thankful for that um so we all have
to

05:03:17.470 --> 05:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that important and and and I
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
did I I wrote something up pretty
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
quickly um I was just going through some
 
05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
things and one of the things I said is
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
is the decision could not have been made
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
lightly but as most of us have lived
 
05:03:33.470 --> 05:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
through this in the state we will
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
remember that the fear was instituted in
 
05:03:37.948 --> 05:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
the population we must remember
 
05:03:40.750 --> 05:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
um that what we heard much testimony and
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
do a look back at what happened we
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
realized that it was a difficult
 
05:03:46.030 --> 05:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
decision that the decision makers had to
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
make I mean we have that is important I
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
think it's really important as a Top
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
Line message this this would be in the
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
introduction they they were working
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
really hard and doing the best they
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
could do uh exactly I I actually
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
forwarded this to uh representative
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
beler and asked him you know I said that
 
05:04:09.788 --> 05:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
I think that this here um talking about
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
how we shut down and unknown and how we
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
have to be thankful and I even even
 
05:04:18.190 --> 05:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
closed with
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you know that we must look at you
 
05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
know thank our our people that were
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
involved in this um I think it's really
 
05:04:28.750 --> 05:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
important to thank
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
everybody I I totally I totally concur I
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
say that it's not just as a legislative
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
body there's the trust with the
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
populace is also trust with the state
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and I think what you're hitting
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
upon is the trust with the state
 
05:04:48.390 --> 05:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that we recognize the
 
05:04:50.910 --> 05:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
challenges they faced and the challenges
 
05:04:53.548 --> 05:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
that probably going to come next time so
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
it's I commend you for wording at that
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
way because I think we need to be sure
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
that they know we
 
05:05:03.150 --> 05:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
have their our support we appreciate
 
05:05:05.310 --> 05:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
what they' done I agree with
 
05:05:08.590 --> 05:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
you I mean we to leave something like
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
that out would be fool hard
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
opinion and I just go back to what I
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I don't if you had a
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
chance to read through it and it goes
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
with a pandemic and that's the Fear
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
Factor it's it's when you have such
 
05:05:35.788 --> 05:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
unknown and you're living in a vacuum
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
you're trying to figure out what's right
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
or wrong and there competing data
 
05:05:42.990 --> 05:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
whatever is going on out there it's
 
05:05:45.628 --> 05:05:45.638 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to deal with people
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
when they become emotional and IR
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
rational I agree with you well we're
 
05:05:56.670 --> 05:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
dying right so um but yeah so does
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything represent po
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
off uh today uh during the morning we we
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
discussed uh um briefly
 
05:06:15.310 --> 05:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
compensations uh to certain injured
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
individuals but uh we we even earlier we
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
discussed like New Hampshire like as you
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
know like
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
previously uh returned some fines to
 
05:06:31.830 --> 05:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
businesses issued uh during uh lockdowns
 
05:06:37.310 --> 05:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I I mean uh currently some
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
states uh take measures on people who
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
were probably needlessly fired to for
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
refusal of covid vaccine mandated in
 
05:06:56.548 --> 05:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
their business and those people receive
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
compensations but for example
 
05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
for um uh even though most people who
 
05:07:06.910 --> 05:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
received vaccine they seem fine we we
 
05:07:10.548 --> 05:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
obviously have people who had uh severe
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine reactions to the point of um
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
being uh handicaped or otherwise s
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
injured and uh existing
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh existing um mechanism of comp
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
compensation are often honorous and not
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
working and overwhelmed with number of
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
people uh who want
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
compensation uh uh so maybe it would be
 
05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
prudent to include some recommendation
 
05:07:45.080 --> 05:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
prudent to include some recommendation
into

05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
report uh as as government is reacting
 
05:07:56.110 --> 05:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
to pandemic uh that there needs to be
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
some safety mechanisms uh better safety
 
05:08:02.670 --> 05:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for people who are
 
05:08:02.680 --> 05:08:04.548 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for people who are
inadvertedly

05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
inadvertedly
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
um act uh thank you represent po off uh
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
so um from Dr vau this morning um he has
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
just I believe received a grant in his
 
05:08:29.708 --> 05:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
State uh to do research on long long
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
covid um which I think will benefit
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
everybody um and the effects and uh he's
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
documenting uh he's
 
05:08:42.548 --> 05:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
I guess it's just he's just work getting
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
the grant uh going so um knowing that
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to be out there I think
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
will be extremely important to people
 
05:08:53.470 --> 05:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
not only in New Hampshire but throughout
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
the country uh to understand what his
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
findings are going to be and looking at
 
05:09:02.670 --> 05:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
that um but as far as compensation
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
represent P up I've seen some of the uh
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
reports coming through and they're in
 
05:09:10.590 --> 05:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
different states for um people who have
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
um were fired or let go of you know a
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross worker who was forced uh to
 
05:09:20.590 --> 05:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
leave his position uh because he refused
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um and then there was
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
another one working for Bart um that is
 
05:09:25.958 --> 05:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
another one working for Bart um that is
being

05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
compensated um but I don't think I th
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
those are individual cases that are
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
being brought
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
before I don't know if that would happen
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:09:43.230 --> 05:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
um only because we are in at will state
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and I can just tell you that on
 
05:09:46.548 --> 05:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I'm just going to say this
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee so that everyone hears
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
this I met with a woman about a
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
different topic had no idea you know for
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
some reason I said oh I have a committee
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday and told her what our
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee was she goes oh I was one of
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
them and I'm like what do you mean she
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
goes I was a first responder in the
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
state I was the top first responder
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh in my area they actually put radios
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
in my personal vehicles I was the first
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
one they would call and because I
 
05:10:19.390 --> 05:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
refused the vaccine they said you either
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
do a mandatory retirement or we will
 
05:10:21.638 --> 05:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
do a mandatory retirement or we will
fire

05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
fire
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
you and she had to find another source
 
05:10:28.750 --> 05:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
of income um but those are some of the
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
stories that you're talking about but we
 
05:10:33.548 --> 05:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
are in at will state just so you
 
05:10:35.948 --> 05:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that represent
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair um yeah when
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
it comes to the the the vaccine issue I
 
05:10:44.430 --> 05:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
do think obviously so much of it was
 
05:10:46.750 --> 05:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
Federal and because it was I mean it was
 
05:10:48.270 --> 05:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
an item that was recommended by the
 
05:10:50.590 --> 05:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
state I think there's a necessity to
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
bring in what we know which one of the
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
most important things I think we've
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
discovered at this point is that when it
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
came to making recommendations for the
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines it they our state really first
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
of all didn't seem from what we know
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to have access to any sort
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
of detailed Federal data um that we may
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
have heard about and they were for the
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
most part just taking Federal and
 
05:11:16.600 --> 05:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
most part just taking Federal and
professional

05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
association um evaluations and
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations and guidance at face
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
value which is seems to be what they
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
did President belter I hear what you're
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
saying the challenge I think as a
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
clinician when you're in the midst of an
 
05:11:40.510 --> 05:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
epidemic is what data is is out there
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to support any
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation um a lot of it comes from
 
05:11:46.190 --> 05:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
your colleagues a lot of it comes from
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
things you've heard worked in some other
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
capacity and it's very very difficult I
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
mean that's why we do double bind
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
studies we we do a lot of studies out
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
there we go through it and we rely upon
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
the data that comes through those
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
studies to show us what works and what
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the challenge I think I
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
would face is that if you don't have
 
05:12:06.510 --> 05:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
those studies and you're collecting the
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
data going through the study it's hard
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
to differentiate and make that clinical
 
05:12:15.070 --> 05:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
judgment so I hear what you're saying
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
and not disagreeing with you but just
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
trying to explain that when you're in
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the midst of it all it's very difficult
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
to say what's the real data that I can
 
05:12:24.750 --> 05:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
hang my hat
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
on and I you take the recommendations
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
because that's all you have until you
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
come through Beyond it that's all yes
 
05:12:35.548 --> 05:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think that's basically the
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
point I was trying to make is that we
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
were taking the federal government's
 
05:12:40.910 --> 05:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
guidance that we they were providing to
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
us and we
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
were that's just what it was we didn't
 
05:12:46.590 --> 05:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
develop our
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
own recommendations based on our own
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
studies or anything like that we we took
 
05:12:52.510 --> 05:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
the professional data that was available
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
and we and we went with that I I I want
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
to be sure I'm agreeing with you but I
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to be sure why I'm agreeing with
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
you at the same time I think we actually
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
on the same page on that one um so I
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:08.830 --> 05:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
you there is Common Ground out there
 
05:13:12.910 --> 05:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
Ground sometimes we we we have the same
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
goal we just have different ways of
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
getting there I've used that many times
 
05:13:21.310 --> 05:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
myself when I was on the Board of
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy with a colleague of mine and we
 
05:13:23.878 --> 05:13:25.470 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy with a colleague of mine and we
would

05:13:25.470 --> 05:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
have very robust discussions we agreed
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
upon the end result we totally disagreed
 
05:13:35.390 --> 05:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:38.110 --> 05:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
there well I'm just trying to sorry I'm
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
sorry didn't me jump in um so I'm just
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
trying to think about this in terms of
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
like findings and then recommendations
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
so I don't know quite how you break it
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
up but a recommendation could be that
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
the our Public Health folks continue to
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
try to figure out a way in their systems
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
for response to pandemics uh to try to
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
find some space to
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
to to analyze the data more
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
independently if it's impossible before
 
05:14:11.470 --> 05:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
I mean unless it's impossible before
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
issuing guidance I mean that's I mean
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
that that's the kind of stuff that we
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
can say that I think we can all agree
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
on right I mean so at you know we all
 
05:14:25.470 --> 05:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
know what we've heard in this committee
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
I mean the testimony is the
 
05:14:27.440 --> 05:14:29.708 align:start position:0%
I mean the testimony is the
testimony

05:14:29.708 --> 05:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
um and we've listened we've as had
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
chance to ask
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh and discern you know and
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
then if we didn't think something
 
05:14:40.830 --> 05:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
something was right we can ask it again
 
05:14:44.310 --> 05:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
to you know to get to the bottom of it
 
05:14:48.548 --> 05:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
and um so we have findings through that
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
we also in listening to that have been
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
able to discern really some of the
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
points that
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
were you know the trust the fear the not
 
05:15:04.110 --> 05:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
coming together those have been loud and
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
clear those findings we can't
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
dispute um and so we can approach this
 
05:15:12.480 --> 05:15:13.708 align:start position:0%
dispute um and so we can approach this
from

05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
findings but we all again we have to
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
look at what we did positive so we we we
 
05:15:22.030 --> 05:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
have to emphasize the
 
05:15:24.990 --> 05:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
positive and realize that our findings
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
are after the fact that we weren't this
 
05:15:30.070 --> 05:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
is now not living through the
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic um so that that that's and
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's why in in the beginning we have
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
to recognize that um
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
and so by way no no means should this be
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
people feel like this is a criticism but
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a tool going
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
forward um and be and that's what I'm
 
05:15:56.190 --> 05:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
hoping that it will be a tool and then
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
as we have data we can give data of
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
things that we've received even if it
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
was from the federal government or
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
federal guidance and say look at this is
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
what we found out from F that was at the
 
05:16:08.190 --> 05:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
federal level this is what the state was
 
05:16:11.070 --> 05:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
privy to because
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it all went hand inand and
 
05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
as uh representative groer last week was
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
talking about you know we have a
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
healthcare worker shortage
 
05:16:25.230 --> 05:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
well and I agree but also at the same
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
time we lost like this first responder
 
05:16:29.230 --> 05:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of healthcare workers because
 
05:16:32.350 --> 05:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
of the mandates and not only because of
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
the mandates that's and some of them
 
05:16:37.230 --> 05:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
were imposed because if you wanted to
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
receive payment like at the county
 
05:16:40.830 --> 05:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes you wouldn't receive
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
payments if you didn't impose those
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
mandates and that was Federal
 
05:16:48.548 --> 05:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
guidance and not state so we have to
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the two even though
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
it affected us at the state level we
 
05:16:56.548 --> 05:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
need to point out that why did it affect
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
us at the state level it wasn't through
 
05:17:01.470 --> 05:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
any fault at of the state it was through
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
the federal government and then the
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
question becomes what can we do as a
 
05:17:09.390 --> 05:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
state to try and mitigate that in the
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
future or ask our
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
Congressional do you understand where
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going right I I totally concur with
 
05:17:19.948 --> 05:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
I understand where you're going I'll go
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
back to the comment you talked about
 
05:17:24.110 --> 05:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
before being an
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
any um what do you call it any will as
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
far as an employment is concerned at
 
05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
will thank
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
you and that's a tough one because you
 
05:17:39.230 --> 05:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
know we really in this state take
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
Independence pretty seriously so we
 
05:17:42.750 --> 05:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to infringe upon the
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
independence of the business
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
community so that's a struggle too is
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there is going to be
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
that issue between the state
 
05:17:55.350 --> 05:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
philosophy of Independence and what that
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
means to the worker not saying we're
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to solve it but it's recognizing
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
that that is in fact an issue that
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
that's out there so if you had the
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
federal government coming back and
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
saying this is what you have to do it
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
almost puts the employer at risk because
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
they can't get the reimbursement they
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
have no choice so you're raising a
 
05:18:30.548 --> 05:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
point earlier Barbara and that actually
 
05:18:37.390 --> 05:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
is is why our committee came together
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
because there continues to be a lot of
 
05:18:44.548 --> 05:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
um how should I say disagreement on the
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
way the the the various agencies played
 
05:18:51.150 --> 05:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
out and the systems played out and that
 
05:18:51.160 --> 05:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
out and the systems played out and that
I

05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
mean that's why we're here right right
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
right because and and it's it's that
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement and then in the in the
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had I mean you guys uh
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
brought in a lot of folks that you know
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
they really had issues the way it played
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
out and that was part of what the you
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
know so we can talk about that um anyway
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we're we're here so anyways I
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate that that I
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
really agreed with you and that's the
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
point and I would say when we first
 
05:19:26.788 --> 05:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
started I'll be when we first started
 
05:19:28.830 --> 05:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
this committee we were probably like you
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be really hard to
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement but it's because as
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
you said there's a lot of disagreement
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
out there that's really unfortunate and
 
05:19:39.868 --> 05:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're working toward
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
is to try to sort of bring consensus on
 
05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
a on a few issues that I think we all
 
05:19:48.670 --> 05:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
can agree on so yeah you
 
05:19:51.390 --> 05:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
know out well on the other end here and
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
to follow on that President able is the
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
fact that this committee worked through
 
05:20:00.990 --> 05:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of challenges yeah but at the end
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
we have come together that in itself is
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
quite an
 
05:20:07.708 --> 05:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
accomplishment so I think we need to be
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
sure we don't l side of that within the
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
report to commend the people in this
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee that yes we heard we listened
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
but we actually pulled something
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
together that I think we all can come to
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
an agreement on yeah and I mean I think
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
if we can agree that we're not going to
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
throw a whole bunch of people under the
 
05:20:27.750 --> 05:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
bus I mean I don't I I don't want to
 
05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
crush them under the wheels I think
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
everybody did the best they can they can
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
do um but that doesn't mean like okay
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
DHHS you really need to keep your eye on
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
the situation with long covid or you
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
really need to keep your eye on the
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
situation on vaccines as they play out
 
05:20:49.390 --> 05:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
over the years you know I mean all that
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so where are we with
 
05:20:53.910 --> 05:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of a recommendation I'm
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about long Co and people do we
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
need resources Financial Resources to
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
help those people get through it do we
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to find out how to um ensure that
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
they get the care they need that they
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
don't get hit financially because if
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
they are falling outside of the
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
constraints of their insurance policy
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to be I think that's
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things we could look at and
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
saying how do we ensure that the people
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that have long Co have been impacted by
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
the epidemic or pandemic that they have
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to get the care
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
they need I'll let representative Bela
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
speak to all of
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you well first I just I
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to quickly agree with what was
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
said before that I think in in the
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
report where there is area for criticism
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there will be some area for
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
criticism it's I think it would be best
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
be levied at the level of the agency and
 
05:21:48.788 --> 05:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
and and Branch not at individuals the
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
point isn't going to be we're not
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
looking to indict or impeach people
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
through a report it's it's a matter of
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
what could have been done better and how
 
05:21:57.310 --> 05:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
did we do better in the future and
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's the way to look at
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
the the bus
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um unfortunately I'm going to have
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
to leave now because I was going to try
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
to get at 4:00 because my computer died
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
um it's on the o table I'm going to try
 
05:22:15.150 --> 05:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
to rescue it and see if it needs a
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
transmission we'll see what's going to
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
go on so uh wish me well um well thank
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
you so just really quickly before you
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
leave I mean I'm jumping ahead so the
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
idea is somebody's going to be
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
generating or because are do we have to
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
get this in by November 1st I I don't
 
05:22:35.310 --> 05:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
know um I like we kind of do that's what
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
it says but it doesn't say that in our
 
05:22:38.000 --> 05:22:38.990 align:start position:0%
it says but it doesn't say that in our
Charter

05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
Charter
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I just kind of told this oh speaker
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
that that was kind of like the due date
 
05:22:47.310 --> 05:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
but um also I just want to let
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bela speak to long covid
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
because he can actually answer that
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
question really quick for thank you I'm
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
sorry can you just re repeat the
 
05:22:56.430 --> 05:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
question I I I need to refresher as to
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
what it was the question I have is that
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's now become evident that there are
 
05:23:04.350 --> 05:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
patients that came down with covid have
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
what they call long covid and they're
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
suffering the long-term effects of it
 
05:23:11.590 --> 05:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
what I want to ensure that somehow in
 
05:23:13.470 --> 05:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance policies of the insurance
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
department whatever it's going to be two
 
05:23:17.708 --> 05:23:17.718 align:start position:0%
things one is that they can have access
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
to their insurance and not have it
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
carved out and all a sudden it's no
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
longer covered and then number two that
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
the state needs to either was Medicaid
 
05:23:27.948 --> 05:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to be representative
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
belard that there's Financial Resources
 
05:23:31.390 --> 05:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we can get those
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
patients the care they need because I
 
05:23:35.470 --> 05:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
think it's no fault to them they came
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
down with Co regardless of the reason
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
for it being but we need to be stewards
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
of their
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
care yes thank you I I would I would
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
tend to agree I think there's certainly
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
room to look at What mechanisms are in
 
05:23:49.270 --> 05:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
place to well first of all I think for
 
05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
the most part under current law there
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be anyone to cut them off from
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
insurance um I think it's important to
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
look at making sure that continues
 
05:24:00.990 --> 05:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
and um I
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
think there's
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
some going to be some issues as to
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether what degree certain things are
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
state level versus Federal level but
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
that could even involve potentially
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation for a resolution
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
to our federal delegation or something
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
of that nature so yes thank you I mean
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
it we can also in our recommendations we
 
05:24:24.070 --> 05:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
can also say something like that needs
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
more study and we weren't able to
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
complete you know because I've done that
 
05:24:31.230 --> 05:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
before like one of the recommendations
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
is we should look at this some more they
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
should look at that it's not something
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
we would do but somebody else could do
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
right and just having Dr Devon here
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
talking about how he just got money from
 
05:24:46.548 --> 05:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
his uh Grant from the uh uh state of
 
05:24:49.110 --> 05:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
Alabama uh to start looking into this
 
05:24:52.350 --> 05:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
because it is a real issue um and the
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
other thing is is to make sure that
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
doctors themselves are recognizing that
 
05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
there is long covid and that they really
 
05:25:02.548 --> 05:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
need to start documenting that and
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it and I think that's a real
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
concern car I want want to say thank you
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%

look at it and just uh peruse it and
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
before you send it out to the entire
 
05:25:50.190 --> 05:25:50.200 align:start position:0%

Kristen uh just sent to me yesterday I
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
just got that yesterday um and have her
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
her you know so that everyone can
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
understand what what a committee report
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
looks like and what my is involved in
 
05:26:07.708 --> 05:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
that so I want to send that out to the
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
entire committee
 
05:26:15.070 --> 05:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll meet next I have next
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
Friday's meeting is scheduled at 10:
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
a.m. um and
 
05:26:23.190 --> 05:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know about anyone else but
 
05:26:24.990 --> 05:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
this has been a true learning experience
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
for me as
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I mean I can't say that I came
 
05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
to it with
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm but it's been a you know and
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
I've appreciated working uh with you
 
05:26:38.548 --> 05:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
guys I don't think otherwise we would
 
05:26:41.070 --> 05:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
have been all working together and um
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's been a real Voyage of of Discovery
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
so I guess the only thing I I hope we
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
can get the
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
report s in advance because it's going
 
05:26:52.670 --> 05:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
to be re I mean I would be uncomfortable
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
voting on a report if I just have it
 
05:26:58.350 --> 05:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
that morning and unfortunately after
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
November 5th we're like I mean who knows
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
where the elections will go maybe we'll
 
05:27:07.150 --> 05:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
all be sitting here and maybe we won't
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
well we're all in office until what
 
05:27:11.788 --> 05:27:11.798 align:start position:0%
December 3rd yeah I guess that's right
 
05:27:13.708 --> 05:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
um but I do think we should try to wrap
 
05:27:18.150 --> 05:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
it up um as soon as we can and
 
05:27:21.150 --> 05:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
um I I just I just want to say you know
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
we'll see where the report works out and
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
if there are things we can't agree on
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
then there's some things we can't agree
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
on and I don't want to walk away from
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
the experience with ill will if we just
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
can't come to you know with there may be
 
05:27:36.910 --> 05:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations we agree with and and
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations we don't and I think
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to all come together
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll just I mean I haven't seen the
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
draft report but I guess I mean that
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
from the heart I don't want that to sort
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
of disrupt our otherwise good working
 
05:27:55.270 --> 05:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
relationship it's okay to agree to
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
disagree and I don't think uh that
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee should have ill
 
05:28:04.750 --> 05:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
will towards anyone else um I
 
05:28:07.628 --> 05:28:07.638 align:start position:0%
think uh that everyone's been respectful
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
to each each other um and hoping that
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
the that we all conducted ourselves in a
 
05:28:17.270 --> 05:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
manner becoming of Representatives for
 
05:28:19.708 --> 05:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire um and I
 
05:28:22.750 --> 05:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
think that is really what is important
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
and uh you know getting to know each
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
other a little bit better as as people
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
um is important um at the end of the day
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're all here to do what's best for the
 
05:28:38.430 --> 05:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens we may agree on
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
some things and we may disagree on some
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
things but it's okay
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
see try to wrap it up then for November
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
1 and
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
then yes I mean honestly got this is an
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
enormous subject and I think we can only
 
05:29:08.590 --> 05:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
do the best we can do
 
05:29:10.670 --> 05:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
right and I think our recommendations if
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are just you know we got
 
05:29:15.270 --> 05:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
to look at this be more we really have
 
05:29:17.070 --> 05:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
to be conscious of this we have to be
 
05:29:19.150 --> 05:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
conscious of that blah blah blah I mean
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing wrong with that
 
05:29:24.750 --> 05:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
considering the breath of the
 
05:29:27.990 --> 05:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
topic correct and we all have to realize
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
that you
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
know this is something that we haven't
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
seen in over a hundred years um not s
 
05:29:37.230 --> 05:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
none of us are scientists sitting on
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
this on on this committee um certainly
 
05:29:43.868 --> 05:29:43.878 align:start position:0%
not my area of expertise although I have
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
learned a lot um and I think we've had
 
05:29:50.190 --> 05:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
some good quality people in here
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
testifying all the Departments have been
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh very forthright and coming and
 
05:29:57.788 --> 05:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
talking with us and uh I think that was
 
05:30:01.868 --> 05:30:01.878 align:start position:0%
a good thing uh so so I just honestly
 
05:30:04.110 --> 05:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if about time but I think we
 
05:30:06.190 --> 05:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
should at least try to look a little bit
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the homeland security report if if we
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
can I don't know representative beler if
 
05:30:14.190 --> 05:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
you have time but it' be be interesting
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
to just at least look at their executive
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
summary and see where they came down on
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
some of these issues I wouldn't be
 
05:30:22.948 --> 05:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
surprised if there's some consensus with
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
them on some of the things that we're
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying I mean especially maybe messaging
 
05:30:29.470 --> 05:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe you guys looked at it I
 
05:30:31.868 --> 05:30:31.878 align:start position:0%
don't know I perused it a little bit
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'll probably do a little bit more over
 
05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the weekend um I have some time this
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
weekend so um but yeah yeah I mean that
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
could also give us some ideas
 
05:30:46.590 --> 05:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
yeah representative beler I was just
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
going to say I haven't done a deep dive
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
I have looked it over at some degree I
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
think the the biggest utility of that
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
report is going to be when it comes to
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
looking at a section of a report talking
 
05:31:00.990 --> 05:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
about stuff like integration of
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
different levels of government and um
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
Communications and stuff like that um I
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
think think that's where the most
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
utility for that report's going to come
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
well and then you know if if that I mean
 
05:31:14.750 --> 05:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's we've talked a little bit is that
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
being part of our findings or
 
05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then that would be a
 
05:31:21.788 --> 05:31:21.798 align:start position:0%
good corroboration for what we've agreed
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
to or what what we think it's always
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
reinforcement uh anyone
 
05:31:36.430 --> 05:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
else no thank you for being here this
 
05:31:38.910 --> 05:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon I appreciate of course I think
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
we're all just like juggling an awful
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff and we did the best we can
 
05:31:42.798 --> 05:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff and we did the best we can
here

05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah we did it was it was big it was
 
05:31:50.788 --> 05:31:50.798 align:start position:0%
big so we'll see where the report comes
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
out I mean honestly I just think we all
 
05:31:54.270 --> 05:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
got to do the best we can do and
 
05:31:54.280 --> 05:31:55.590 align:start position:0%
got to do the best we can do and
recognize

05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that's what it is okay hope we
 
05:32:00.910 --> 05:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to do have another pandemic
 
05:32:03.670 --> 05:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years that would
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
be terrible but anyways I would like to
