00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.710 align:start position:0%
listed so it's important
that<00:28:55.360><c> and</c><00:28:55.519><c> the</c><00:28:55.679><c> reason</c><00:28:56.039><c> we</c><00:28:56.600><c> uh</c><00:28:56.760><c> schedule</c><00:28:57.320><c> these</c>

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
that and the reason we uh schedule these
 

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
that and the reason we uh schedule these
in<00:28:58.159><c> between</c><00:28:58.640><c> is</c><00:28:59.320><c> people</c><00:28:59.640><c> have</c><00:28:59.880><c> things</c><00:29:00.120><c> to</c><00:29:00.320><c> do</c>

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
in between is people have things to do
 

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.310 align:start position:0%
in between is people have things to do
um<00:29:01.360><c> so</c><00:29:01.640><c> we</c><00:29:01.760><c> don't</c><00:29:02.240><c> want</c><00:29:02.399><c> to</c><00:29:02.559><c> schedule</c><00:29:02.960><c> them</c><00:29:03.120><c> all</c>

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
um so we don't want to schedule them all
 

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.870 align:start position:0%

03:46:01.229 --> 03:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
increase in weight basically is they
 

03:46:01.239 --> 03:46:03.309 align:start position:0%
increase in weight basically is they
want<03:46:01.359><c> to</c><03:46:01.520><c> put</c><03:46:01.640><c> a</c><03:46:01.760><c> lot</c><03:46:01.960><c> more</c><03:46:02.199><c> horsepower</c><03:46:03.159><c> which</c>

03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
want to put a lot more horsepower which

weighs<03:46:03.680><c> more</c><03:46:04.159><c> and</c><03:46:04.279><c> then</c><03:46:04.439><c> of</c><03:46:04.640><c> course</c><03:46:05.040><c> you</c><03:46:05.199><c> need</c>

03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
weighs more and then of course you need
 

03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:07.910 align:start position:0%
weighs more and then of course you need
a<03:46:05.800><c> lot</c><03:46:06.000><c> more</c><03:46:06.239><c> stopping</c><03:46:06.800><c> power</c><03:46:07.319><c> which</c><03:46:07.560><c> weighs</c>

03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more stopping power which weighs
