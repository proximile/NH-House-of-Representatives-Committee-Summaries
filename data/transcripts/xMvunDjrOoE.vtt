known as a Lakes Region and uh I've seen
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
enough of the world which uh I think
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
I've got a great appreciation for what
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
we have in this area i' like to uh keep
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
our way of
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
life well thank you all it appears
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to be on this committee
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
so so I better not say I
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
didn't now this is my uh fourth term on
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
the committee I served about three years
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
as Vice chair I'm from plastow I
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
represent plasto Newton in Southampton
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and similar to the
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative to my left plasta was one
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
of only two towns in the entire state
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
that has no standing body of water so
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
you might ask how do you get involved
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
with resources well uh I'm a real estate
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
attorney by profession and as a real
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
estate attorney we deal with a lot of
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
development water supply subdivisions
 
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.350 align:start position:0%
development water supply subdivisions
also

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
disclosures um so I thought that would
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
have been interesting during my first
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
term to be and I asked to be here on my
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
first term also I'm on equestrian uh H
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
ride Prof show um do a little bit of
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
trail riding so the trail riding and the
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
groups I belong to got me interested in
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
this because we're in charge and we work
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
with the trails and the forest and um so
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh we did have a couple of bills few
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
years ago about horses on trails and all
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
my friends showed up we had about 200
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
people come to a herea all equestrians
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
so that's how I got involved in this
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm always proud to tell
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
people that this is a
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
very friendly committee um I mentioned
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
everybody probably about 90% of all the
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
bills we passed they go on consent um H
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
and they said how does that happen and I
 
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:28.039 align:start position:0%
tell them it's kind of hard to vote
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
against cleaning water good supplies
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
against past to protect the country and
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
our state and that's the kind of stuff
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we deal with and they go oh uh and I do
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
understand there'll be some bills that
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
we don't agree on but we all work
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
together and I'm looking forward to all
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
of us working together for the best of
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
the state which I know everybody's
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about make this a better place
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
to live for our children and if I don't
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
mention this today my wife who's
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
probably watching uh from New Jersey
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
Jersey will shoot me uh I this morning
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
about 4 hours ago I became a grandfather
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
for the second
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
time and my daughter had a grandon a
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
small baby boy 7B 12 O I'm not sure the
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
height yet but I'll find out that later
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
record for the first time in his life
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
Oliver keki you're on the record of the
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and I hope maybe
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
someday you might be governor who
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
knows so just to let everybody know I
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
our as I mentioned earlier our
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
researchers next door with the clerks um
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
so she may not come in on time our
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee assistant has been with us for
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
a while Jamie Wyman
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
um I've already scheduled for next week
 
00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:56.310 align:start position:0%
um I've already scheduled for next week
six

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
bills um we have 10 on the docket and I
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
expect we're going to get 10 or 20 more
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
um and although they now have a rule
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we can list uh the opportunity to
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
exact a bill without at any time I'm
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to you're going to notice that in
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
the calendar I'm going to put that in
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
every time but it's not my wish to
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
invoke it unless I have to uh so
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
exacting bills will be published and
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
listed unless there's something that we
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
need to do time
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
constraints um I don't know when our
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
first exec session will be I need to see
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the next week how many more bills we got
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
in if we don't have a lot of bills for
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
our third hearing then I might have a
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
short exact session in the beginning at
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
10: and then move on to some bills if we
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
have a lot of bills a lot of FNS a lot
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
of second committee bills we'll have
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
another day a hearing and then probably
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
the next meeting we'll have some exec uh
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
we'll work that out with um
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
representative NAB and everybody will be
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
given notice of it um so nothing will be
 
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.909 align:start position:0%
given notice of it um so nothing will be
a

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
surprise and
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's how we're going to schedule
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions they can
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
can wait until they're done then pass
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
them up okay um if there's only one
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
filling them up then send them up
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
because I put them in order with the
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
clerk and he needs the cards for the
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
record um so I'll know who to call up
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
next and the blue sheets are at the end
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
against and I don't know if we want to
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
check Arie do you want to go see if
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
Jamie wants to come in we got five
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to ask if our
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee assistant wishes to come
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
in she's the assistant for the committee
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
if you think we need something it always
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
helps if you ask me and just say Mr
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair do you think we could have the
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
assistant do something to to accumulate
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh something for us rather than 17 of us
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
giving her
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh also I have asked her this
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
time because although I know we all know
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
how to print and we all know how to put
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
things together this year I asked her
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
when she sends out the notice can she
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
PDF all the bills we're talking about in
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
one PDF and send them out to us so that
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
you can print them all together and she
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
did that for the first four bills she's
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to do them again for the next six
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
because then you don't have to go and
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
print them one at a time and compile
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
them together I thought and she goes oh
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's easy I can do that so I thank
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
Jamie for that for the first time we're
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
going to see it again so if you don't
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
read the bills in advance as they come
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
in you'll get them with the package of
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
the notice of the hearings so all you
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
got to do is download the whole thing
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then you'll have time to look at it
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
since we meet on Wednesdays and unless
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
something happens I continue to meet on
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays um we have to schedule I have
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
to schedule the next week's meeting by
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
noon time today so usually by Tuesday
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
night I send in what we're doing because
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're busy here so it's like I don't
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to forget so the schedule for the
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
next week will be in by Tuesday or
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Wednesday morning for the
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
following Wednesday so you'll have a
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
week's notice of what's coming on but if
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
you just went to the committee and put
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
Bills currently in committee you'll see
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
the 10 bills four we're doing today six
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
were I schedule for next week if
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
overnight it went up to 11 then that's a
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
week yes ma'am Mr chair maybe you said
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
this to your new people but do you want
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
to say anything about the drawers and
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
how people can store things out there or
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
use that room yes so we shared this room
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
with another committee so the other
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
committee asked if they could use the
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
desk I don't use a desk so I said yeah
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
you can use the desk so if you go out in
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
the committee room you'll see a set of
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
draws that look like plan draws that you
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
pull out and you can put a plan in them
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
um your name's on the
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
draws very rarely will be the things in
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
the draw but sometimes somebody will
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
drop a bill off they might have some
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
test Mony and they just fill the drawers
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
um that's your draw if you want to leave
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
something there that's okay but it's I
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
won't say it's not secure but it's just
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
a draw uh but you can check it every
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
meeting before you come in and maybe
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
when you leave I can tell you I usually
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
find it empty but um that's your draw
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
because uh the constituents always ask
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
me do I have a room do I have a desk do
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
I have a private secretary I say no I
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
got a draw
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
I got a drawer out in the in the cabinet
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
there and and I actually had to look CU
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
last year since I was vice chair I was
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
at the top drawer and now I'm
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
alphabetical so I thought they forgot
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
about me so I had to go down the list it
 
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
about me so I had to go down the list it
is

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
alphabetical um so if you look you'll
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
find your draw look in it I don't think
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
there's anything in it there's no
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
welcome gifts or anything it's just you
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
draw any other
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'm just waiting for Arie to
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
10 and for the new people when we
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
schedule a bill like the one at 10:00 I
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
can't start it at 1 minute to 10 I can
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
start at 10:01 I can start at 11:00 but
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
I can't start it before the time it's
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
listed so it's important
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
that and the reason we uh schedule these
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
in between is people have things to do
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
um so we don't want to schedule them all
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same time and they're here all day
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
to wait to testify at 3 in the afternoon
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
and there is no magic to how much
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
minutes I put between the bills I just
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
basically say gee how many people do I
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
think are going to testify and my guess
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
might be wrong I might think one
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
person's going to testify on a bill and
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
there might be 10 so this is why I can
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
start a bill later because of overage of
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
the first bill before it but I can't
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
start it
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
early um this week I scheduled them a
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
half an hour a piece next week they're
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled 45
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
minutes and if they go over they go
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
over we usually like to start at 10: and
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
the last schedule hearing would be
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
around 3: so that you could plan if you
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
want to plan your life we try to get you
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
out of here by 4: or before 4 four so
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
you can get home um and like today we
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
just started with four bills so we're
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to do them I'm not going to break
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
for lunch because if we have some
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
testimony that brings us over I I just
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
want to finish the four bills and then
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
everybody will be dismissed what did she
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
say in the cler oh she's in the cler but
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
she'll be here in after okay so our
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
committee assistant is also in with the
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
clerk's meeting I guess they take
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
precedence over us cuz
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
our house clerk reminded me yesterday
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
that he's in charge of all the clerks so
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
he has precedence over over me and
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
us um so it looks like it's 10 o'l with
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
past so I'm going to officially open the
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%

Windsor residents approach me to see if

we can get some help to uh allow them

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty small town uh there's one
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
Road in and pretty much all the town
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
roads that go into Windsor are in
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
Windsor are dead end roads they're dirt
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
roads uh this the little portion Which
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
is less than 2 miles of State Road is
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
the only paved Road in town everything
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
else is Dirt Road in town and Dead End
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
roads the Selectmen of the town have
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
given the residents the authority to
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
ride their roads with ohvs ATVs and utvs
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
are legal on the roads in
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
Windsor so as it is now it's very common
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
when when I'm driving in there to see
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the ATVs or the TVs as their primary
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle when they're moving around town
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
to get their mail or whatever they need
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
to do the problem is is we have on this
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
map that I shared with you a small
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
section of State Road that actually
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
divides the town so the people on one
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
portion of the Town actually cannot
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
legally get to the other portion of town
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
to visit family friends or whoever um on
 
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.629 align:start position:0%
to visit family friends or whoever um on
their

00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
ohvs unless they travel the state
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
road because this is part of our um RSA
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
in order to give them legal Authority on
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
that portion of the road to travel back
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
and forth we need to put this into the
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
RSA so this bill is hopefully going to
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
be as simple as that for us to be able
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
to get through um on the map you'll see
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
that um I identified where the Hillsboro
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
Windsor line is and there's 8/10 of a
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
mile of State Road that's summer
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance only that travels down to
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
black p uh black Pond Road and there's
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
another 9/10 of a mile on black Pond
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
Road that's that's state maintain for
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
summer so they would like to have access
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
to this one so that they can continue to
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
move around their Town they're not
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
looking to open up an ATV Club they're
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
not looking to have um there's no trail
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
system over there so it's not going to
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
draw in a trail system there's no Club
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
that's organizing over there um this is
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
you know theoretically this is for the
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
the local use to be able to continue to
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
use their Road system uh the Selectmen
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
so far are in favor of this they are
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
still working through their public here
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
ings uh so they have been aware of
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
what's been going on through the entire
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
process I've given them their
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to make sure that they
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
have their public hearing with uh
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
notifying their Butters um so far the
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
feedback that I'm getting there's
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
roughly 12 houses I should say that too
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's roughly 12 houses that's on this
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
path of 1.8 miles uh and so far the
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
feedback that I've received is all
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
positive from the residents Hillsboro is
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
a pretty small town they have 275 re
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
residents according to our meals and
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
population uh they only have 11 kids in
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
school 152 of those residents are
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
registered voters so they're primarily
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
adults that are in this town um small
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
population of children so um I you know
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
again when they approached me about this
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I looked at the situation being an
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
active uh member of a ohrv club uh I
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
identified there's not a dust issue this
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
is these are paved roads so it's not
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
going to increase dust they're already
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
traveling on their town roads without
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
complaints or issues or um any negative
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
results to the to the selectman so
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for years I talked
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
with the police Windsor does not have a
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
police department so they rely on the
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
state police however when the call goes
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
to the state police the state police
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
calls Hillsboro Hillsboro responds to
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
the to the accidents or any um issues
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
that are over there and I talked with
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
our police chief in
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and he he has no issues with
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
this in fact Hillsboro has their roads
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
open to UTV travel and he said over the
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
course of the last three years he's only
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
had one accident that he's had to um
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
tend to with a UTV on our roads in
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro um
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
so hoping that you guys would consider
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
passing this and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions you might have I missed any of
 
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.349 align:start position:0%
questions you might have I missed any of
the

00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
details thank you than you any questions
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question can you just
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarify for me does the Department of
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation have to weigh in on this
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a state road like why does
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
this Authority exist with the select
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
board or the
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislature the select board first has
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
to have their public hearing
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are following the
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
wishes of their people so that is a
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
requirement under the process of the law
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
that exists the do
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
um will probably want to weigh in on
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
this the do can grant access to cross
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
the road if there's Crossing but in
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
order for us to have um traveling on the
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
state road it has to be incorporated
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
into the RSA and forgive me because I
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
did not write down the RSA number I bet
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
this RSA
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
25810 section 4 um specifically has to
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
have the listing of the town in the
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
road based off my best
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
understanding representative Davis thank
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious the speed
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
limit on this 1.8 uh mile par solo land
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
25 M an hour going in and I believe
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
there might be one small section that's
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
35 mil an hour but I'm not confident
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm right on that and if you notice
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
on the map it's a pretty straight shot
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
the the line of sight is pretty clear um
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
so they have they don't have to worry
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative and
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
just um trying to make sure I understood
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
what you said um that the uh Selectmen
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
have approved use of uh ohvs on other
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
town roads but there still debate
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
discussing um approval for these state
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
roads is that what you said they have
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
approved uh ATV and ohrv well ohrv use
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
on all of their town roads they cannot
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
and are not authorized to Grant access
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the state road however in order to
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
have this bill passed they have to
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
notify the abuts they have to hold a
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing and then they can make
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
their decision whether or not they're in
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
approval with
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
this knowing what I know unofficially so
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
um we do not foresee that there's going
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be an issue with this knowing that
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are some people on this route who
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
are asking for this so they they are
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
under the RSA they're obligated to hold
 
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
under the RSA they're obligated to hold
public

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
hearings and I met with them last night
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
and so far everything's going well
 
00:38:47.319 --> 00:38:50.069 align:start position:0%
and so far everything's going well

00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
ghou uh are the roads paved or not I
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
didn't catch that I'm sorry can you

repeat that are the roads paved these
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
two they are the only paved roads in
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
town are these sections of the um State
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
Road and just maybe one tenth of a mile
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
going when Windsor Road comes in and
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
tees off there's about a tenth of a mile
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the right that's paved and then the
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
state road going to the left which is
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
black Pond Road is paved for uh one
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
mile thank
 
00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:21.510 align:start position:0%
mile thank
you

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um as I recall
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
that seems there's a Sim similar
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
situation up in gorum where these the
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
ohvs come out of Jericho park and go
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
down the stay on the roads and go in
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
through town is can we get any
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
information on on their experience with
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's a
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
question not of the speaker because I
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
don't know you wouldn't have any
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
information on that I don't have
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
specific information but I can tell you
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
that I I've ridden up there and there's
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
a trail system up there so there is kind
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
of 1 Point to to another point there is
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
no trail system in in Windsor that is
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
managed by a club there's there's no um
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's no draw over there so being The
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
Treasure of the Kentuck Valley ATV
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
riders we manage the trail systems
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
through henker into Hillsboro but we end
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
at a certain we end at a restaurant in
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and in their in their ballpark
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
we do not go further west into this area
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
so there is no organized Club in this
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
area to manage Any Trail systems there
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
is north of the town but they already
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
have access to everything in that area
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
now as it is thank you there's no draw
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
for tourism I should say there really
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
isn't in my
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
Vale good morning thank you for taking
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
my question um do we have any idea how
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
much traffic would be coming through
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
this area should this be signed into
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
I do not have any study numbers on that
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
but I do not predict that it's going to
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
be any different than what they have
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
today um
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
because the if there's Hillsboro
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
residents who are driving in this
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
area one they're doing so
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
illegally um but they can only take
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
their utvs down this area and if if
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
anybody's not familiar with the
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
difference between a UTV or an ATV I'm
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
happy to explain
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
they can only take this UTV down into
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
this area so it would only be specific
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
traffic because they are somewhat
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
landlocked they can't cross Route 31 in
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro that's a state road and they
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't have authority to cross that road
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
so it's only the people if you look at
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
the map on the right side of the page
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's Stow Mountain
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
Road so people who live on Stow Mountain
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
Road are also on the other end uh
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
trapped in per se uh by the state road
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the residents within Windsor Road on
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
that section
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
around or a second time
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm sorry I'm
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
still trying to wrap my head around the
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
authority if the select board decides
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
not to support this what happens to this
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislation this dies at that point in
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
time if I get word that they have
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
decided against it then I will
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely make the recommendation that
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
we kill this bill so far everything has
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Taylor thank you for
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
question what is the winter maintenance
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the road you mentioned summer twice
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
but I heard nothing about winter
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance the town is responsible for
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
doing their the plowing of this portion
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the state road so they take care of
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
any of the plowing and any of the winter
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs that are associated to
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
the State Road the summertime the state
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
is the one that's responsible for doing
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
any maintenance needs along the
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
road so wash outs anything that may be
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
pertaining to that the state takes care
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
of in the
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
summertime you know I'd also like to
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
mention um you know ohvs are usually
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
less than 1,000 lbs whereas Vehicles you
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
know 4,000 5,000 more so for the town of
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
Windsor with they're when they're
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with their uh dirt roads and
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
everything else I think that this this
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
is a more prudent travel method for them
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
and helps keep their maintenance costs
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
the taxes in in the town of Windsor are
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
$10 per thousand one of the lowest in
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
the state and I think one of the ways
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
that they're able to do this is by you
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
down any other questions for the
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240 align:start position:0%

2024 our land is
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
open for public Recreation but not
 
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.829 align:start position:0%
open for public Recreation but not
motorized

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
motorized
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
Recreation uh during Timber harvests and
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
our land is actively managed uh we do
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
find that ATVs are useful in conducting
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
our forest management work however for
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
us these machines are tools not
 
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
us these machines are tools not
recreational

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
toys um I do oppose House Bill 113 um
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
the sponsor did visit uh the
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
1188 Commission on Friday I am a member
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
of that commission representing
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners and New Hampshire Farm
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau um she gave more detail this
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
morning than she did to our commission
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and we did not really discuss this
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
bill and part of the commission's
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
mission is to review and propose
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislation relating to
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
ATVs uh another part of our mission is
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate conflicts between uh
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
ATV and motorized Recreation and other
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
people using the
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
trails uh law enforcement as we know is
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
strapped in New Hampshire
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh with no law enforcement in Windsor uh
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
if an incident occurs I am not confident
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
that timely uh addressing the situation
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
feasible second uh apparently the uh
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
process is underway to have people have
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
a hearing and have a Butters be notified
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
this also was not clear uh in the
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
present ation that our commission
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
received on Friday um I feel that anyone
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
who would be along a roadway that would
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
have this change in use must be notified
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
and this is by RSA
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
requirement and uh so the fact that we
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
did not really have a chance to discuss
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
the merits of this bill and did not
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
receive the detail that this committee
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
received today I do not support having
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
you uh approve this uh House Bill 113 at
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
this time thank you for your time uh
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
thank you also all of you for your
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
service on behalf of New Hampshire's
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
residents any questions does anyone have
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
a question for the speaker
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you and thank you
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there any
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
sense of when the commission's going to
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation on this bill and
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
other H RV bills um the uh chairman has
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
not really brought brought it up for uh
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
we meet every other month uh and we met
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
on Friday so we will not meet again
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
until March so that would probably if we
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
were going to discuss it and
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh support it or not that would probably
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
be the earliest that we would do so
 
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.309 align:start position:0%
be the earliest that we would do so
thank

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
I can't read your last name but um David
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
right good morning Mr chair and members
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name's David rodrig
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant commissioner for the
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation um thank you for taking
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony the department doesn't take
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
a position to support or oppose this
 
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.309 align:start position:0%
a position to support or oppose this
bill

00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
but we do have a couple of concerns that
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
we'd like to bring to the committee's
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
attention with our read of the way this
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is written from our read of
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
the the bill the law would simply make
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
these roads open for OHV use without the
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
public process that is required by
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
communities when they open class four
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
five or six roads for OHV use so this
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
this law is at the end of of that this
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
chapter and simply opens these roads for
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
use and it it is certainly our position
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
that um the law should at the very least
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
refer to RSA 215
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
a69 which does require public
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
notification of the abutters which does
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
require a public hearing which does
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
require a request from the select board
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
and also has a mechanism to um close
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
these roads to OHV traffic if at any
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
time in the future um that use is is not
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
working well the other thing that
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
section of law requires is signing of
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
the road so whenever we begin to mix
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
ohvs with vehicular traffic we think
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's very important for two things one
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
the ve the vehicular traffic of the
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
roadway should know to expect ohvs on
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
the road and the OHV user should also
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
know where the on road use begins and
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
ends and this signing would would
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
provide that so we would recommend two
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
two changes either this this language be
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
Rewritten to make clear that in order to
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
open these class five or class two State
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
maintained roads the town go through the
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
process that's explained in RSA 2
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
a69 that's option number one or option
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
number two which would require no law is
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
for the town of Windsor to simply
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
request of the Department of
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation to reclassify this from a
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
Class 2 State maintained road so to a
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
class 5 Town maintained road which the
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
law already offers a process for
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
communities to open up their class five
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
roads for OHV use well we think OHV use
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
is not the end of the world on these
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
roads they're not particularly high
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
traffic they're dead end essentially
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
this would be the the first law that I'm
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
aware of outside of Coos and Grafton
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
County that opens up a state maintained
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
Road for OHV use and we do have concern
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
about heading down that that path the
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
law in Coos in Grafton county is very
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
spe specific to Trail connectors and
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
connections OHV use in in Village
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
districts and so forth if we go down the
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
path of starting to open up our state
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
maintained roads for OHV use it will
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
bring a number of complications for us
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with from both a safety issue
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
and a maintenance issue I'd be happy to
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions Mr chairman thank you
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
speaker representative na I promise I
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't always ask this many questions um
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
if under the suggested changes thank you
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question under the
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
suggested changes you had if you were to
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
close the road is that a permanent
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
closure like if they decide this isn't
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
working out could they permanently close
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
it without interference from the
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislature or would this would they
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
have to come back to change the law
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
again it's it's my belief that if this
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
law were to require the town to follow
 
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
follow the process of RSA 2115
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
a69 that process then allows the the the
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
town to open and close the the road
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to the
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%

destroyed by ohrv Trails misplaced ohrv
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
Trails um I urge the members of this
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
commission committee to familiarize
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
yourselves with the ohrv citing statute
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 215a 41 42 43 which dictate all the

criteria that must be met before ohrv
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
trails are opened on state land um
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
please itl
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
hb13 it's not in keeping with the trail
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
sighting standards spelled out in RSA
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
2155a 41 42 43 these standards were
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
the documented nuisance of ohrv writing
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
as a Coos resident I can tell you that
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
the taxpaying homeowners who have The

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
want the nuisance right outside their

obnoxiously disturbingly damagingly loud

and moreover as any a butter will tell
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
you ohvs often ride in packs of four or
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%

amlin actually I probably don't need but
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
so my name is Claude pigeon I am from
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
Berlin New Hampshire I am here
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
representing myself but I am also a
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
member of the study committee as a
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
preface I would like to say uh just
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
qualification that I do not represent
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
any one
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
philosophy to another I have been um a
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
great uh proponent of motorized Sports
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
almost all of my life I have been an
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
off-roader snow machiner pilot um so and
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
I still love my Harley so the uh only
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
thing I haven't done I guess is Drive
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
motorboats I am also a an Enthusiast of
 
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.990 align:start position:0%
motorboats I am also a an Enthusiast of
hiking

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
hiking
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
kaying and nonmotorized activities so I
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
have my feet in Two Worlds uh so I guess
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say that I'm coming to
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
objectively so my issues with this
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill it's rather innocuous as
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's stated as you see it but understand
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
the nature of this industry one thing
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
you hate when you're an off-roader is
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
coming back the same way you went you
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
always want to be doing Loops that's
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
just the nature uh nature of uh of the
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
industry and so yeah right now we have a
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
node we have a group of people who just
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
want to access the main Trails seems
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
rather simple but history has shown that
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
once you create a connector you don't
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
have a node anymore you have a node with
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
an invitation to develop and before too
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
long there's another node up over here
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
to the Northwest that says wow you know
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
6/10 of a mile or 8/10 of a mile has
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
already been taken out of our 3M
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
connector this is doable and in a very
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
short amount of time um you no longer
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
have a node you have a circuit that's my
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
first issue my second issue is that the
 
01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
way these bills are drawn there's no
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
dead end on it so if two years from now
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
another club makes a connector and your
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
traffic goes from 30 units a day to 650
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
units a day there's no device but by
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
which you can go back whoa whoa whoa
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
this is not what we approved it's too
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
late so the way we write these bills we
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
do not write a dead end into them and so
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
your if if your 20 or 30 units A Day
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
become 600 units a day it's too bad this
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
is in an area I I look I checked out
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
Windsor very carefully you have quite a
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
few youth camps all within a couple
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
miles and you have a large number of
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
bnbs so you have an economy basically
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily favored uh by
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
this change in activity those are my
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
first concerns my second concern is a
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
little broader not specific to this
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
topic but um Germain to what was said
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
previously you have the people in
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
Windsor who are taking their kids to
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
school they're going shopping they've
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
they've become um these these units
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
these machines have become their second
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
Vehicles the whole process was
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
specifically design designed for access
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
to Trails the idea of using your ATV to
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
go to aishan to buy your spring flowers
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
or to go to the AA and do your shopping
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
is totally totally not what this was
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
intended to be so what happens now where
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
you might have somebody coming through
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
and coming back through six hours later
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
has grown exponentially you're bringing
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
the kids to school you're going
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
groceries you're going to pick up your
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
your whatever so your traffic has grown
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
exponentially so instead of having 12 or
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
15 machines a day you have that
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
exponential number of four or 500 so the
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
whole argument of saying that you know
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's our convenience is really contrary
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
to what the intended initial uh intended
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
use was um of of these vehicles this
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
industry and this Hobby and so that
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is not anything that can
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
be controlled but yet this is something
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
you have to keep in mind uh not just
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
what is presented cuz what is presented
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
is in fact pretty innocuous but what the
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
potentials and likelihoods are when you
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
open up a road and provide permission
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
for uh for this activity to um you have
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
to look at the unanticipated results as
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
well as the intended results and I think
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
I was well less than my five minutes sir
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
you did well thank you Mr P I see you
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
coming back later any questions for Mr
 
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.870 align:start position:0%
coming back later any questions for Mr
pit

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
pit
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
you're is there anyone that wishes to
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
speak that hasn't filled out a pink card
 
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.670 align:start position:0%
speak that hasn't filled out a pink card
on

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
hb13 I'll ask one more time anyone else
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
to speak on
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
hb13 seeing no one approaching the
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
speaker table I'll declare this hearing
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
closed and now that we're after 10:30
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
I'll move right into the hearing on HB

they'll collect them
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
FN there's the
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
cards call the prime sponsor
 
01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:12.069 align:start position:0%
cards call the prime sponsor
representative

01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
Willette thank you very much um as I get
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
started I have two pieces of
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
um information i' like to pass around
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
the first one is a letter from um
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
executive counselor Joseph Kenny in
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I have a copy for
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
members and I'm also passing around a
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
small packet uh that I prepared for the
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee members so they can um kind of
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
understand what we're trying to talk
 
01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
understand what we're trying to talk
about

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
here so as I start again thank you Mr
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you committee members
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to hear this
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh House Bill 127 uh seems like a a
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
very simple Bill all we're trying to do
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
is make the
 
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
trails closing opening
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
consistent meaning there's on the
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Headwaters
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
land there's a two pieces of Trail total
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
about 10 and a half miles and it
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
connects 120 small odd miles Northern
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
Trails for the town of Pittsburgh and it
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
connects about 700 miles of Trail South
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
through cook arrrow all the way down
 
01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.430 align:start position:0%
through cook arrrow all the way down
through

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
milin Berlin and
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
gorm every once trails close are are
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
should say our open until Columbus day
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
except for that 10 and half
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
miles and you might ask the question
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
what's the big deal about 10 half miles
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
well what happens is we have a very
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
unique trail system in the North
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Country for a couple reasons the first
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
reason is that it allows you to go to
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
destination to destination it's really
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
the only one in the country that does
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
that that you can get up in the morning
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
in Pittsburgh and go to Berlin for lunch
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
or you go to Berlin uh in the afternoon
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
and go to Pittsburgh for dinner
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's very unique in that
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
way and not having those two small
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
sections of Trail open it basically
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
landlock Pittsburgh so people that are
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
riding Pittsburgh can't leave the town
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
but it has a tremendous effect on
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
colbrook also because cook has
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants and amenities but there's a
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
lot more housing and and um camps and uh
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
places for for uh tourists stay in
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh so they work very very
 
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.669 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh so they work very very
closely

01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
closely
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
together but a little bit of background
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
is that the conect headwaters property
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
is about 148,000
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
acres and that sounds like a big number
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
and it is it's about 228 square miles or
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at the other way about half
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
the size of Sullivan County this one
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
property the Kut River Headwater uh
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
property was created through the state
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and so it would ensure
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
access to Sportsmen forever there are
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
easements on the
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
property and
 
01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
um so there's Recreation Hunting Fishing
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh there's 10 and a half miles of uh ATV
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
Trails um snowmobile trails and of
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
course there's a we're trying to sustain
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
a logging business uh industry in that
 
01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.189 align:start position:0%
a logging business uh industry in that
area

01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
also when these easements were made and
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
this Con heav Waters was put together
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
Jean she
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
and Jud Greg were very instrumental in
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
putting this
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
together right now the land is owned by
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
Aurora sustainable lands they own the
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
property but the state of New Hampshire
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
owns the roads and in that property
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's well over 200 miles of roads
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
that are accessible to anyone they're
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
open um and the Department of Natural
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
cultural resources oversee those roads
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and maintain those roads
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
so Aurora sustainable land owns the
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
property but the state of New Hampshire
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
roads a a few years ago there was an e
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
economic impact study done and the ATV
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire uh comes out
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
to about $460 million a year which is
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
just behind snowmobiling and not far
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
behind the ski
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
industry with over 80% of the ATV trails
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
in Coos
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
County um we the benefit of most of the
 
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.270 align:start position:0%
County um we the benefit of most of the
economic

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
impact and it's a it's a huge thing
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've lost a lot of our manufacturing
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
base and our tourist business is our
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
main industry in that part of the
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
country it sounds like a lot of money
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember Kos county is
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
the poorest county in the state of New
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one of the poorest
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
counties in the
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
country so our typical season is 9 weeks
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
that 10 and a half miles of Trail we're
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
talking about right now closes September
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
30th everybody else in the area closes
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day anywhere from 8 to 13 days
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
later all we're asking is just keep it
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
open that next to 8 to 13 days nothing
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
else no big changes just keep it open so
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
that the people from the southern New
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
England our tourists can have full
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
system if you look at the economic
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
impact and break it down it doesn't seem
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
like a lot but those two extra weekends
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
for the North Country the economic
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
impact is about $9 million a
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
weekend and uh I read a study not too
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
long ago and they said for every new
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
tourist dollar that comes in the area
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's spent eight times before it leaves
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
huge the town of pit the club in
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh has over 100 miles of Trail
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
and if you want to take a look at this
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
this map here this is what we're talking
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
about these are all Pittsburgh Trails up
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
in this area you can see how it comes
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
through down through cber stewartown
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
arrol millsfield all the way down to
 
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.270 align:start position:0%
arrol millsfield all the way down to
Burling

01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
gorm so Pittsburgh has 120 miles of
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
Trail and 110 of it is on private land
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
only 10 miles is on the Connecticut
 
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
only 10 miles is on the Connecticut
River's

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
Headwaters and again everything else you
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
see on that map closes Columbus
 
01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
Day cor has 117 miles of Trail arrol now
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
has around 160 miles a trail and as a
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
key to um to the South and so that 10
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
and half miles by by closing off
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh affects all of
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
us law enforcement in that
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
area the primary duty is uh by fishing
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
game the secondary uh is done by the kis
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff's department fishing game
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
subcontracts them through the season and
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
they'll do a lot of the law enforcement
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
area we're at a hearing uh a while ago
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
last couple months and fishing game said
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
that they did not have the manpower to
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
do law enforcement on that 10 m of Trail
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
because bird season starts the 30th and
 
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the Manpower and then
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
they came up and said well I think it's
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
going to be dangerous to have bird
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
Hunters interacting with
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
ATVs but you look at that Map There's
 
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
800 miles of Trail there that had been
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
open for many years uh working running
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
the same time of as bird season and has
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
never been an issue
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
so what U the co County delegation has
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
done uh we put in our budget and made
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
arrangements with the Coos County
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department that coas County
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
will do law enforcement on that 10 and a
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
half miles for that extra 8 to 13 days
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it's no extra cost from the to the
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
fishing game and for that 10 miles of
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
that over the last few years
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
um through climate changes we've all
 
01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
um through climate changes we've all
seen

01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
how um we don't get the snow like we
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
used to is just had a tremendous effect
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
on some of the businesses in Pittsburgh
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and throughout the North
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
Country uh when a business close closes
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't hurt the people that own
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
the business it hurts their employees it
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
hurts the whole North
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
Country um so anything that we can do to
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
support these businesses and keep them
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
going um is good for all of us and and
 
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
just a a reminder there's we're talking
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
about two sections of of of Trail and if
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
two you can you can see on that one the
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
one that shows
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
Clarksville on the uh a to the left that
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
is coming off Cedar Stream Road which is
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
a a Town Road in
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and and then where it ends um
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's where it comes off the
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
um the concut river Headwater land um
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
that's all we're talking about and those
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
two Trails uh this one you see a little
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
360 by the helicopter that's a trail
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
that connects to C Brook and the other
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
one connects to connect to C Brook but
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
also connects to arrol
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
South and on the third map that is west
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
of that area and again you can see
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
that's about a 2 Mile piece and it's not
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
these are logging roads that are
 
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
connecting Trails it's not main roads
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's not traffic roads it's just roads
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
on the headwaters and they're just
 
01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
on the headwaters and they're just
connecting

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
connecting
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
Trails uh from one to the other and you
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
can see on this little map here the
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
amount of trails that you see all those
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
yellow lines and that's all on private
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
land all we're talking about is just
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh two miles or so that are
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
so I I guess uh that will conclude what
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
I have but um I also and I can forward
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
it on to the uh the committee I did
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
receive a letter this morning from
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
police chief duie from Pittsburgh um
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
saying he supports uh this bill 100% And
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
he does uh a lot of the law enforcement
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the Pittsburgh area to the ATVs and
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
um absolutely said this is a imperative
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
area and if there's any questions I'd be
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
them questions for the
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Sergeant thank
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh representative I was
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
just quickly looking at the statute that
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
applies I don't see any other time
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
periods when a trail is open or closed
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the statute is that is my
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
understanding correct and if so why
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
should we do this one in the statute
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
well that's a very good question thank
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
you uh the the trail systems
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about trails and we can
 
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
talk about economic stuff but we have
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
nothing without Cooperative land owners
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm a member of the cook Club the
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
metallic ATB club and we close our
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
Trails on Columbus Day because of two
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
two reasons um that's when the hunting
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
really starts to heat up and that's what
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
the land owners requested and that's why
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's no law that says you have to
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
close a certain day but up in the North
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
Country we've taken the uh the the
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
position that most everyone closes on
 
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.110 align:start position:0%
position that most everyone closes on
Columbus

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
Day representative NAB thank you Mr
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
has the headwaters advisory Council
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this legislation they did
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
and uh they did not support it uh let me
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
back that up they did not uh
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um coming in this legislation this they
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
had their last meeting that we attended
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
was an October this was brought up and
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
they did not support it um and the
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
advisory committee is uh a lot like the
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
commission to study ohrv use in New
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we have a a wide range of
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
people in interest and uh in any
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner or anything the the ohrv
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
business is kind of um can be
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
polarizing uh and that night there were
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
more Nays and yays and and so they um
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
they they did not support it uh but it
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
just seems like such a minor Common
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
Sense thing not creating Trails not
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
adding any money to the budget not doing
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
anything just closing changing the
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
closing date by depending on when
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is you know 8 to 13 days it
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
just seems logical to support the
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
Country um and sorry this is not my
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse so I'm learning um it's Al my
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
understanding when it closes that's when
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
the trail maintenance is done and how
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
would this extension impact the amount
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
of time it's uh that's um there is some
 
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
done but not generally the way that that
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
it works um and it's a it's a kind of
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
a tough uh situation because really the
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the season is 16 weeks we start uh a
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day weekend and we're done uh
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day so if you go to Columbus
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
Day it's 18
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
weeks what happens is in the North
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
Country a lot of times we don't even
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
open on Memorial Day weekend because of
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
snow and it's still too wet and again we
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
have to protect our land owners and not
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
you know let anybody on the trails
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to destroy destroy their
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
property so a lot of work goes on during
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
the summer and there is some trail work
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
done at the end of the season but it's
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
what we couldn't get done during the
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
summer but as a as a rule we don't
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
schedule Trail work in the fall we want
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
question as I understand the
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
conservation easement um that um you
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
know isn't was put in place as you
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned it uh requires Harman of parks
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
and R to develop a management plan um
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that uh oh use o HRV use is a
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
secondary use as opposed to hiking and
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
hunting and things like that that are a
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
primary use
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill therefore sort of
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
usurp um the uh conservation easements
 
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
usurp um the uh conservation easements
um

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:35.410 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
intent I don't I no I don't think so and
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you why because when the
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
conservation easement was put in really
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
the sport of ATV didn't
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
exist and uh this is a a working
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
document and as we've all read in the
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
paper uh dnrc is negotiating with blue s
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
h excuse me Aurora Land Management uh on
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
the easement on negotiating how much
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
logging was going to be and and if you
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
look in the easement it's pretty black
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
and white what the amount of Timber
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting should be so it's it's as
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
things evolve uh there's things come up
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
that change and um so it's a it's a
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
document anyone else for question
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
dncr good morning my name is Craig reny
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of the Bureau of trails at
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
dncr uh thank you chair and committee
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to testify this morning
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
um we do have some handouts going around
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad to hear um chair harb that
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
it's a friendly committee because I do
 
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
have a number of things to cover so
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
quickly so I guess the first thing to
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
say is um you know dncr isn't taking a
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
position on the bill uh we just wanted
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
to provide some background information
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
about the Connecticut Lakes Headwater
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
property and so that's what a lot of the
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
information in the packet you're going
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
to see about the property and the
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
easement and I'm just going to to cover
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
some some key points in the testimony
 
01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:27.350 align:start position:0%
some some key points in the testimony
this

01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
morning um you know we recognize the
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
importance of the New Hampshire tourism
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
economy particularly in Pittsburgh and
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
but we have to balance that with the
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Connecticut Lake uh
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and working with
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut lak's Headwater citizens
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh committee that was just mentioned so
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
we have to work with our partners and
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to figure out those uses um
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
again background in info it's you know
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
originally it was 171,000 plus acres in
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
2001 that was purchase with the Trust
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
for Public Lands and of that 146,000 was
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
sold to the forestry company which is
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
now Aurora and then we received dncr
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
received 269 miles of roads and 100
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
acres for the Deer Mountain Campground
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
expansion also 25,000 Acres went to New
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game for uh protecting
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
highly sensitive natural areas and then
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
the conservation easement was put on the
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
working Forest okay and then um
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
part of the management of the
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes Headwater property it
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's um the organizations our dncr with
 
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
our division of forest and lands and
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
parks and wreck also fishing game
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
department and then Aurora is at the
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
table as well as the landowner um it's
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
also uh and I think it was just
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative harb it's also
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
Guided by Connecticut Lakes Headwaters
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
citizens committee and that's per RSA um
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
12 a 9B so there's there's specific
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
criteria in in that statute now and one
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the things I just wanted to point out
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
is in section B it talks about uh
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
providing advice to the Department of
 
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
Natural cultural resources and the
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
fishing gain department on the
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
management of public recreational use of
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters tract
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
including uh the seasonal use of the
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
road system snowmobile trails and their
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
use and the terms for Access and use of
 
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
the track by motorized vehicles um such
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
advice shall be offered in cooperation
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
with the private land owner so again
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a trifecta of management
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
decisions that occurs with the landowner
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
and with our sister
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
agencies um so as mentioned one concern
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
to consider is the passing of this bill
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the existing RSA
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
1289 a uh excuse me b um so it's just
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
something to consider and then you know
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
in the conservation easement itself
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it requires dncr to develop
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
in in consultation again with the land
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
owner and uh Public Access and
 
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
recreational use management plan and
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's uh to be consistent with the
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
purposes of the easement and the
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
stewardship plans and so the Connecticut
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
Lake citizens committee U met five times
 
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
over the course of 2022 and 23 to
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
discuss the uh Public Access and
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
recreational goals for the property and
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
solicit input um for expanded
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
recreational uses uh we also released a
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
survey and and asked for input of of
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
other expanded uses um on the property
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
and during that whole process we didn't
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
receive any requests to extend the at V
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
season as we went through that all the
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
meetings were publicly noticed and
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
notices were sent out um you know about
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
the committee meetings and whatnot so we
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
recommended adopting a five-year
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
management plan that goes from 24 to two
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh 2028 and that was adopted this past
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
May at the May 10th meeting so again
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
this was never brought up as we went
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
through our our you management committee
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
decisions um and then just finally just
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
as kind of a quick recap cap that uh
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative olette mentioned uh this
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
request came to dncr initially to extend
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
the the ohrv season on the connectic
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
Lakes property um around Midsummer and
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
we reached out to the citizens committee
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
to get input on that as well as fishing
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
game and we heard several committee
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
members were opposed fishing game was
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
opposed as well for some of those law
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement reasons uh that fishing game
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think we'll talk about today um and
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
then uh commissioner Stewart at dncr
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
issue a letter denying extending That
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
season to Columbus Day weekend uh the
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
town and the ATV clubs um did ask at
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
that point that we reconsider our
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
decision and it was then brought with a
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
special meeting in front of the citizens
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
advisory committee to talk about it and
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
as representative olette mentioned uh
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
there was a six to3 vote in opposition
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
of extending the ohrv season on the
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
property um so that's just by way of
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
background that's that's important to
 
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.550 align:start position:0%
background that's that's important to
know

01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know and basically one thing
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
to not to complicate the discussion but
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's a there's a large piece of
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
private land just off of the property
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
the Perry stream U tracked and and that
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
landowner makes their own decisions on
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
when ATV uh you know trail system is
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
open and they allowed it to to be
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
extended to Columbus Day weekend which
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
is AB buding the Connecticut leges
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
Headwater property hence the request to
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
extend it here because they are
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
connector trails with the private land
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
um so again uh after reconsideration
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
dncr commissioner Sarah Stewart um
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
issued another decision on September
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
30th to keep it at September 30th and
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
not extend to Columbus Day weekend and
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
in her letter she just requested that um
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
any future um requests to extend the
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
seion should be in writing to her by
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
April 1st of this year so that we can
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
then again bring it to the citizens
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee the Aurora and fishing game
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
and our partners on the on the eement to
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
get approval for that um I'm happy to
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
take any other questions though on this
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Derby thank you
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
question y um if I understood uh what
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
you just said the um commissioner sorry
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
Sarah Stewart uh yes she um she said
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
that if she received a request by April
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
1st she would um seek input and and
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
without basically uh within the
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the conservation easement
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
um would consider extending the season
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
yep yep and I think that was stated when
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
we met with the committee as well uh
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
again the the timing of you know the
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
request came last season to extend this
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
past fall and you know we had a we had
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
to pull together a special meeting on a
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
pretty short time period and then again
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
it got voted down at the committee so it
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
can come back back up again and but she
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted those requests by April 1st
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
so we can go through the proper channels
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
and procedure to see if we could extend
 
01:31:54.189 --> 01:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
it thank you y representative Davis
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'm just
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
curious do you know Aurora's position on
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
this um yeah I believe Aurora and I'm
 
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
looking to Johanna Lions as our Park
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
planner and she's also the administrator
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the Connecticut Lakes Headwater
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
property at um with dncr as well and I
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe their position on that is they
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to extend any additional ATV
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
mileage or seasons on the trail system
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
I for somebody else take it thank you
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative NB thank you Mr

chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify there is a process
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
for changing the date and this
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislation is sort of an override of
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
that process is that correct okay y all
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you y thank
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire hopefully you remember me
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
from half an hour ago um I support the
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
director of fishing games opposition to
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
extending the trails
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh on the Connecticut Lake headquarters
 
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
um this is there is a public process to
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
manage these lands and this is an end
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
run around it um again if we go back to
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
the trail sighting statutes the intent
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
is for public interest to uh the intent
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
is for the public it's in the public
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
interest to balance the demand for ohrv
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
Trails on state lands with other state
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
priorities and non-motorized Recreation
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it must be done in quote cooperation
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
with the Department a fishing game and
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
all other custodial State agencies and
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
there uh so yeah it's in the statute um
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that fish and game
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
data shows that ohrv registrations have
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
dropped for three years in a row since
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
the covid peak they're now back to their
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
2018 levels and ohrv registrations have
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
always been significantly and
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
consistently lower than hunting and
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses New Hampshire always
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
sells more hunting licenses by around
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
20,000 than ohrv registrations and well
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
over 100,000 fishing licenses if Coos
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
County really wants a robust economy we
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
need to diversify away from
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
ohvs um there is a fiscal note attach
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh where and it's ongoing um
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
where does this $10,000 a year go where
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
where does it come from where does it go
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
is that the actual cost of law
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement for a 10 and a half mile
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
section of ohrv Trail um given the
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
condition of New Hampshire coffers and
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
all our tax uh property taxes going
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
through the roof is this the best use of
 
01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:05.310 align:start position:0%
through the roof is this the best use of
public

01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
money um and uh climate change was
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's changing our Seasons
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
so then it's really in the state's best
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
interest to reduce our burning of uh
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels instead of finding ways to
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
burn more of
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
time oh actually I'm sorry I have one
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
more thing I have friends who live in
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh uh I have friends who have
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
camps up there they've lost the peaceful
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
right to enjoyment of their property by
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
having ATVs roaring past their homes
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds all day
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
long questions for the
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
testimony Mark Brady in support of the
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman um appreciate

the opportunity to come here today um
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know this is a follow-up to I guess
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
the discussion as you've kind of heard
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
from last fall on this issue uh what I
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
would say is this and you know I can
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate being in your position I
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
remember being in the legislature when
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
Benson was governor and that's when this
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
was all just started I'm from Jefferson
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
the county administ rator I've been in
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
the North Country off and on my whole
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
life grew up in the tourism business uh
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
my grandfather started Six Gun City
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
Norman dub boy who started Santa's
 
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
Village they were they were Berlin boys
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
from the East side and convinced him to
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
go start six gun so I'm I'm very Akin
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and very attune just from that ethos
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
alone to the tourism industry up north
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
as you know the north country's two
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
primary Industries are Timber and their
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
tourism and between the two of them it's
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
about $5 billion uh collectively between
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
the two 3.2 and and 1.6 right around
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
there and um we've done a very good job
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
as the state has in general of managing
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
all the different rights between you
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
know the conservationist recreational
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
users uh Property Owners uh Etc but let
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
me be very clear the
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
legislature when we went down this road
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
on the ohrv a lot of us up there we were
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
not big fans of it but we've learned to
 
01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
live with it and when with all due
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
respect when the the nice lady here from
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
gorum says it all needs to go away there
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
will be nothing left of the North
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
country that was part of the issue of
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Aurora on the
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
harvesting of the Timber and this
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
legislation in when you understand it in
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
context is part of a bigger
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
understanding by all of a in the North
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
country and I mean you have the
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
executive counselor I believe you have
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
the state senator you have the nine
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
representatives from all of the North
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
Country you have the three the three
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
County commissioners of which
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner Gorman here he'll be up
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
here in a little bit uh you have the
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
county sheriff we all see it the same
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
way and when they denied that last fall
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
and the representative olette just
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned what ises it $9 million a
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
weekend so that's $18
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
million they took out from these
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
business owners and you should look at
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
these business owners when they come up
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the market
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
working again I remember being in the
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
legislature with with with Governor
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
Benson and I remember what the North
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
country was going to get back then if if
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
if any of you remember this or not you
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
know Timber the Mills are gone and it
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
and it's had a profound negative effect
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
on the North Country we were given two
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
things by conquered we were given two
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
prisons prisons and let's do
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
ohrv and you know what the Ingenuity of
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
our people they took the
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
ohrv and they've done an incredible job
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
with ohrv to the point of New Hampshire
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the study from 2020 uh I
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
think it's the ninth largest we've gone
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
into the ninth ninth largest industry
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
economic prod C in the country that's
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
unbelievable when you really think about
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
it cuz think about the size of New
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know think about even just
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
the land area of New Hampshire versus
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country that are
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
doing this but again you know we
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
understand we all understand the
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
implications of
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
ohrv Coos County does we understand the
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue you'll have the
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
sheriff that will come up and talk about
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
that that's a priority for all of our
 
01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:48.270 align:start position:0%
that that's a priority for all of our
decision

01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
makers we do look at this very much from
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
an economic development perspective
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
effective because we are the poorest
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
county we're 2% of the population 20% of
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
the land area Graft in is 16 to 18% of
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
the land area between those two counties
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
you have almost half of the state okay
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
40% is is 2% and 20% of the of the land
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
area we're generating we have over a
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
million visitors that come to Coos
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
County come to Coos County what is the
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
visited uh what is the number one
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
visited area of the state actual uh it's
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's Mount Washington now that the old
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
man is gone it's Mount
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
Washington now we know rooms and meals
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're generating an incredible amount of
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
economic activity for you here in
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
conquer for your communities all over
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
this state we would argue that we're not
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
getting we're not getting back our fair
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
share but that's not what this
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
discussion is about today we've got
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
other things going on that we're going
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
to start to explore that because the
 
01:40:59.709 --> 01:40:59.719 align:start position:0%
North Country at the end of the day is
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
not just your our North Country it's
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
your North Country too we are the
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
identity of the state we're generating
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
economic activity and it is absurd it is
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
ludicrous and it's one of the nastiest
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
things I've ever seen by some
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats and conquered to say you
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
know what we're not going to give you
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
two weekends we're not going to give you
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
basically 5 days for all intents and
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
purposes five days and somehow because
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
those five days is going to make all
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
hell break loose and this can't be done
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's bull that that that's that's
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
bull and we operate from the county
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
perspective we operate two nursing homes
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're the only only county in the state
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
that has two nursing homes one in Berlin
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
one in West stewartown we have our
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility as you know the
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
state downshifts costs to the counties
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a fun place to be to run a
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
county and it's sure not a fun place to
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
be to run a rural County this is not
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro OR Rockingham
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and that that $18 million that would
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
have been generated that's real money to
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
our residents that's real money to our
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
tax base that gives them the ability to
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
pay their taxes Etc which are
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing you go to Pittsburgh which
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
has a a population of what is it 850 to
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
a th000 let's say it's a to keep it
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
easily a thousand you can go up there on
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
a weekend you can have 4500 5,000 people
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
they actually just had their first good
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
weekend for this this this winter was
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
just this past weekend because we
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
finally got some snow all the way up
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
North and the climate change has
 
01:42:46.109 --> 01:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
impacted certainly the importance of
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
ohrv because you can't rely on the snow
 
01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:50.679 align:start position:0%
machines the way you used to I grew up
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
on snow machines going up into kill
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
Kenny the end of our property you you
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
can't rely on it anymore the way you did
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's why they did come to the table to
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
ask for it to have it open last year
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we have been beaten up we
 
01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:07.719 align:start position:0%
haven't had good winners at all and I
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't understand why why you here in
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
conquer would object to that it it it
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
just it does
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
not it's to me it's not fair this is
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
good responsible public policy with
 
01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative wette and our
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
representatives are proposing
 
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
here and we're asking you to
 
01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
here and we're asking you to
please

01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
please let this be open and we've been
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
forced down this road and I want to say
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
something about
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
dncr you know dncr with all due respect
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
to dncr the way they run their shop in
 
01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.629 align:start position:0%
to dncr the way they run their shop in
the

01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
easement they forced Coos
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
County the smallest and the poorest
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
county in this state we had to go find
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
our own
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys to have them interpret the
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
easement that Shaheen and Greg spent 30
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar of all of our money with
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
both Federal monies and state monies for
 
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.070 align:start position:0%
both Federal monies and state monies for
that

01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
easement to try to get them to enforce
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
the easement they have not done their
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
fiduciary on that
 
01:44:13.599 --> 01:44:15.149 align:start position:0%
fiduciary on that
easement

01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
easement
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
and so again this is an important issue
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
to us I would urge you as well when we
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
start talking about this easement to
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
going and look at CO's submission on on
 
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
the Aurora component of the stewardship
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
plan right now there's no harvesting of
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
log of of logging going up it's very
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
minimal we've gone from 40 to 30 down to
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
we we at 10 even this year this is
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
important to us opening these Trails is
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
about economic activity and doing it in
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
the right way and we urge you to please
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
please pass this
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I'd like to remind all the
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
speakers that we try not to impute
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
anything on any of the other departments
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
or any other speakers so if you could
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
just watch all the speakers watch what
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
you say about anyone whether they're a
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
prior witness or a state representative
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
or a department representative we try to
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
maintain decorum here in this friendly
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
committee understood and I think that's
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
what my fellow wanted to say do we have
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you very much
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
oh we had
 
01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.470 align:start position:0%
oh we had
[Music]

01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
one then
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't thank you for taking thank you um
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous to ask a question
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
after just being spoken to in that
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
manner um if there is a process that
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be followed to open these
 
01:45:51.149 --> 01:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
followed there's a process
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that the process isn't
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
working okay and uh because there's a
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
hard date of April 1 so they lose I
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
would say that's they had good reasons
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
to want to ask for that okay and and I
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
don't know why you would sit there and
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
say with all due respect
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
representative um I certainly wouldn't
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
oh well they missed that April 1st so
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's it so why should be treated
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
differently I'm not I don't I don't
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
think that's the issue at all okay
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
personally and and I will tell you this
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
as well what what I think from our
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
perspective is that um excuse me thank
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
you I I'm I have your answer thank you
 
01:46:34.239 --> 01:46:35.870 align:start position:0%
you I I'm I have your answer thank you
very

01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%

much any other
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%

01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
again thank you but my concerns have
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
been eloquently addressed by previous
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
speakers so I will uh gladly
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh not be redundant and uh uh wave my
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak again thank you Mr
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
pigeon we appreciate that because we
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
have quite a few other speakers here
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's lined up with pink cards in support
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill Ray
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:21.589 align:start position:0%
Gorman County Commissioner District
number

01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
three thank you folks who give me the
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
time to speak today here and I believe I
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
can offer two three different angles on
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
this situation that we have going on in
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
the moment I am part of the headwaters
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
and first of all it it this is an
 
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
and first of all it it this is an
economic

01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
issue as well as you'll hear the uses of
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
non-motorized but this this issue
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be completely that way because
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
the bird Hunters primarily are the group
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
in there at that time they tend to not
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
come as heavy as many of them early in
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
the season because of the leaves all
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
right Etc I I'm an avid Bird Hunter I
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
have bred Britney American Britney bird
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
dogs for 40 years I have competed
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
nationally Canada won multiple
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
championships in American Britney Hall
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
of Fame and I don't want to be dragging
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
right now but I'm just want to tell you
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
that to get to that level where I did
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
was I need to train my dogs a minimum of
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
three times a week an hour per dog okay
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
run two at a time and I know where the
 
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
birds are I know we're the best places
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
out of train my friends do as well and
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things I will say is that the
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
area that the trails that we're asking
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
about to affect the bird
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
Hunters it's it's not in my opinion
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's significant compared to Scotts
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
bogs East Inland and we're talking a a
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
very large area here and the trails that
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is a small area 10
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
miles versus 200 miles of Roads Etc it
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
it really should be the importance of
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
just the the area we want is important
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
so I believe there's no reason why the
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
bird hunters and the other people I I
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
feel the bird Hunters what they do is
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
they drive up a road they see a pull off
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
and they go with their truck okay if
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
they have dogs they unload their dogs
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
and out they go two three guys they're
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
Walkers it's the same thing all right
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
they're not on the roads I mean there's
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
the old road Hunters yes but they're not
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the same areas as the ATV people and
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
even if they are they're off the trail
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're in the woods the guns that they
 
01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:49.159 align:start position:0%
are using are Shotguns with low pellets
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay they're not out there with double
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
odd Buck they're not out there with
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
slugs okay so some of this needs to
 
01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
balance and and I think it's a big part
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
today that's my part there I think
 
01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why that cannot all
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
work there's no reason that Bird Hunter
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
should be just fine that should do well
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
economically I live in cber I'm a
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
selectman in COK as well I've been
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
involved with the HRV some of the things
 
01:50:14.589 --> 01:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
that you talked about your previous
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
hearings our our community we did the
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
public hearings we have roads open
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
we''ve you had to work with it
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement so on and so forth and is
 
01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
working and is a tremendous boost to our
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
community economically it has brought in
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
several people that have bought houses
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference snowmobiles and
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
ohvs for the North country is a huge
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
thing Miss
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
and the ripple effect of this last
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
weekend was the first decent weekend of
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
snow snow in Pittsburgh all the trails
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
are open Pittsburgh was very busy and
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
cook was very busy our restaurants were
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
full all weekend our Motel was full and
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
the ohvs I think even have more of a
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
ripple effect because the Berlin gorm
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
traffic loves to come to Pittsburgh they
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
go there have lunch and head back so it
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
affects all of our area but we have and
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
in the last few days I went around in
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
the past week I've been around to the
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
businesses I've been around I've U to
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
the Selman I have a statement here from
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
the selectman as well I'll have passed
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
out to you folks I should have given
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
that to you immediately of their support
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the board supports that
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
these Trails stay open till Columbus Day
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
weekend it's important to understand
 
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
that it affects everybody up there it
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
affects I'll say it affects you guys
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
with rooms and meals so on and so
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
forth and lots of people have spoken on
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
that and I'm going to keep stressing
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
that being part of the advisory
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee there's a document that was
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
written there's copies of the public
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
hearings okay and it was clear in those
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
documents and what those folks did back
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
then the Fred Kings all those folks
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
economics was a big part of this all
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
right they wanted to protect the timber
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
industry the forest industry okay they
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the document also
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
flexible in in that document it talks
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
about motorized Sports okay so it's
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
before the
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
OHV times okay and the economics of the
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
area they were very very specific about
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
how important they knew what this
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
tractor land how special it was and how
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
much it meant to the North Country okay
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
to the county all right and and I think
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Brady made a very good we have ohvs
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles that's one of our big things
 
01:52:59.790 --> 01:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
we have the prisons in my area okay
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
we've lost so much industry it it's just
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know my brother lost his job in a
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
paper mill my sister lost her job in a
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
in a Furniture Factory so the whole area
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
I mean it it it needs this these folks
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
when they came this summer to the public
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
hearing they had just come off from two
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
bad Winters all right and not
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily a good summer because we had
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
so much damage from the floods those
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
100e floods that are now becoming 5year
 
01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
floods to Trails to roads the winters
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
without snow okay they needed some help
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
all right at the public hearing that
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
night for that committee all right it
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
was quite obvious the people in that
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
room okay a large majority I'm willing
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
to say 80 to 90% were absolutely in
 
01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:52.750 align:start position:0%
to say 80 to 90% were absolutely in
favor

01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
favor
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
all right of keeping those trails open
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 more
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
days it's it's it needs to be seriously
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
considered and uh we appreciate your
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
help with it I'm going to give you my
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
statements that I have from the uh
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh select board who I spoke with
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
last night um I think Mr Brady and
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
everybody else made it very clear that
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners are totally
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
behind us for our whole County you know
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
right right through Senate Joe Kenny and
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
definitely all of our reps so I hope
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we do have some influence on this
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
folks thank
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
you oh whoops any
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%

01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
question uh commissioner do you see any
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
downside to this
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
legislation could you say that one more
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
time do do you see any downside to this
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislation anything that's oh
 
01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely not absolutely not I mean I
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
think that this no reason we're talking
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
10 days to start with we're talking a
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
town that's been specifically singled
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
out okay out of a whole system all right
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
I mean Co County the state let gave us
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to open our roads open our
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
Trails recognizing what it would do for
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
us all right and then we close them for
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
for what for 10 days why it's in the
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
residents there want it open so it's
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's AR we need to keep that open for
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
our area and to through the business
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we have and so on and so forth and
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh and we there is in that agreement
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
that was made there's a lot in there
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
about Economic Development if any of you
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
guys ever have time go to the website
 
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
connect Headwaters and read some of the
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
old history spend an hour or two reading
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
that stuff you'll you'll be surprised I
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
think it's a great document I think it's
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
very well written and you can see what
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
those folks were trying to do and um you
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
know they wanted to keep the logging
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
industry strong and they want to keep
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the tourist those were the two big
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
things wildlife of course thank you any
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
other questions for the speaker
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for um you know articulately
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
describing uh the challenges and I'm
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
wondering as a member of the committee
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and um if you think that the process
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
that was described by um dncr and uh
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
advocated for by the commissioner could
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
work if um
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
if there is a way to extend it using the
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing process it's when it
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
comes to hrvs it's it seems to be
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
difficult sir um I asked earlier when
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the committee was working on the um
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
trails and all the the document that was
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
just signed it I asked about because we
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
needed a we were looking for a connector
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
Trail I think it was three miles long
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
between the kak ATV Club and the
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh club and at that time there
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
was significant resistance from Aurora
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
they were not allowing any more trails
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
to be opened it was it but I was told at
 
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
that time that I could bring it back up
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right and that we did have the
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
ability I mean we we you know but I
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
think we need help from you folks here
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
to show that this process needs to
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
happen in an objective way all right and
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
I an objective okay not just anti this
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
or anti-
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
that I hope that answers your
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
question any other
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
testimon and I'll give the handouts
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you again for the
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
ability to uh speak on House Bill
 
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
127 um several people have already
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
spoken and raised some points that I had
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
in my prepared testimony however um I'd
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
like to make a couple notes uh we mark
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
and I have a conservation easement on uh
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
our property that's next to the guile
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
State Forest um that is held by another
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
entity as is the Connecticut Lakes uh is
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
the easement is held by the state of New
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we are still the land
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
owners and we still have the right to uh
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a say in the management of the
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
property um there are uh quite a few
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are contained in the
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
easement uh but it is a working Forest
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh conservation easement um we've
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
developed uh 10 miles of Trails um at a
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
significant cost to us uh for for that
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
so I would I would suggest that the
 
01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.589 align:start position:0%
so I would I would suggest that the
committee

01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
weigh the uh rights of the landowner um
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
part of me sees this as a property
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
rights issue and
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative ulette read part of
 
01:59:36.430 --> 01:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
the uh ohrv 1188 commission's uh
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
objectives um but there is one other
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
that he did not refer to so I would like
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
um number five the report the commission
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%

1st of each year so part of our mission
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
is to weigh in on legislation we did
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
just learn about this particular uh bill
 
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
but we did not discuss it and we did not
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
make a decision one way or another on it
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%

02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
into consideration the first one in
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
support captain Michael Eastman New
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
Eastman Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee I apologize to excite everyone
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
behind me but uh the uh Fishing Game
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
Commission is actually in uh opposition
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
of this um bill so then you checked the
 
02:01:18.069 --> 02:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
apologize my other uh card that's in
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
there for the next bill is would be of
 
02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:30.270 align:start position:0%
there for the next bill is would be of
support

02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
then thank you all uh for having here
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
today I uh I am here at the beest of the
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh namp Fishing Game Commission um they
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
had uh had all met and taken a vote to
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
oppose um this uh this proposal or this
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
bill um certainly uh and this uh comes
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
from the uh when we first went in front
 
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee and were asked about
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
our stance on uh opening uh this section
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the headwaters property it um it was
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the reason for the closure at
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
this time is because uh small game
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
season our
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hunters um for grous and and such open
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
on October 1st uh so therefore the
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
caveat of opening up this property was
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
to uh close it so that it was open to
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
primarily to our
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
Hunters um certainly director simc and
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh the commission and myself understand
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
you know how important ohrv Commerce
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
Commerce just to Kos County and what the
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
ohvs bring uh to the North Country um
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
but this section of um of property the
 
02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
headwaters property uh is and was
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
designated for
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
Sportsman um and for their uh use of
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
that property now certainly
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
um that's our primary goal here is that
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
we um we look at the rights and the
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
Privileges of the hunters and and how
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can better be successful now
 
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
certainly I've worked this is my 23rd
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
years as a conservation officer I've
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
checked hunters in that area and and
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
ohvs obviously um and what I've seen is
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
that this is really a a destination um
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
there are articles written about
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and uh small game hunting um
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
there are uh I've checked hunters from
 
02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
as far as uh Wisconsin and
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and uh with them they bring
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
obviously their dollars and they bring
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
their their animals with them um and
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
certainly some of those dogs that they
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they run um would cost as much as a
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
a UTV um so that's really one of our
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
concerns is that there would be a a
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
potential adverse um interaction between
 
02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
those Hunters that have come here and
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
possibly travel from afar um and then
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
also the other part of that is that as
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that uh n fishing
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
game is the uh primary uh law
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh agency that covers the
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement of ohvs and hunters and
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
fishermen on that property now
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
understand uh we do uh certainly give
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
ohrv monies uh to Coos County Sheriff's
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
Department to patrol and they Patrol you
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
know throughout their County um the only
 
02:04:26.549 --> 02:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
issue is that and and I will say that
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of law enforcement
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
especially recently in Pittsburgh with
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
Northern borders stone garden um patrols
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
that are going on up there actively and
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
their primary goal is to to do those
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
Northern borders duties um you know for
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
illegal entries and drugs and what the
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
issue is is not necessarily the amount
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
of enforcement that's in the are area
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's what that enforcement is doing so
 
02:04:55.119 --> 02:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
it's what that enforcement is doing so
for

02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
instance the law enforcement up there
 
02:05:01.229 --> 02:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
does not cover accidents that occur on
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
the Trails um and those accidents um you
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
know they will go and they certainly
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
will um take information um and give us
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
that information um but that does not
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
alleviate my officers from having to sit
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
down on a Monday and fill out an
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
accident report and everything else that
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
goes along with an accident um so we
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
really are the primary ones that are
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking care of that um and and uh so uh
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
really you know I'm here for the hunters
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the other Sportsmen that that
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from this uh property like I
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
said uh director simc commission we
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand Commerce we are there for the
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
ohrv community um we are there when
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
there when new stores open up in in
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
gorum uh we're there for the Pittsburgh
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
old home day for or Jericho Fest or
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they call it these days um
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
riverfire we're there really to support
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
the oy community and unfortunately this
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
is just one uh section of the support
 
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
that we cannot give to that Community
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
um that's really the end of my
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions representative
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
NAD thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question a previous speaker
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned the numbers of hunting and
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses versus o Riders does
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
fish game have any sense of that or any
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
tracking of those
 
02:06:28.030 --> 02:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
numbers unfortunately I didn't bring
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
that here today um certainly um when uh
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
Abby Evan Co U did spoke about that data
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know it it's yes we do
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
sell more hunting fishing licenses than
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
um ohrv and through Co ohrv the people
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
were looking for something to do atving
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
UTV that was a big thing that they did
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
number really spiked up and then they're
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
starting to come down to where they were
 
02:07:00.189 --> 02:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know preco so follow up follow up
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
would you be able to supply us with
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
those numbers of course all right thank
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
you very
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
G thank you for taking my question I I
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
may not have heard correctly I I think
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
someone may have said that these uh
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
Hunters go to another area a swampy area
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
or someplace rather than this particular
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
particular area that's is from here is
 
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
that correct or what certainly uh
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
they're I mean they go to Pittsburgh in
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
general so that doesn't exclude one east
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
east Inlet I mean there's there's a tons
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
of places they could
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
go this is one section that's open that
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
is there specifically for sportsmen um
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
that is you know State Property um and
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh so yes there's other places they can
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
go they can go throughout Coos County um
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
but um like I said this section was
 
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
specifically set aside for sportsmen or
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
women of the
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Eastman for taking my question I I
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm a little unclear why this
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
10 miles of Trail differentiates from
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
the rest of the trail system up there
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and as uh as commissioner Gorman said
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
Bird Season doesn't really get hit hard
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
until the leaves drop I I'm just curious
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
what would hurt that for that uh two
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
weeks of of being open to help out the
 
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
economic development of that
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
region thank you for that
 
02:08:33.599 --> 02:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
region thank you for that
question

02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's only 10 miles it's only two
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
weeks uh we understand that and and uh
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm sorry can you say that question
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
one more time well I I don't I'm not
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
clear as the difference uh the maps that
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative wette brought show
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles of trails and it's
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
just this one little island what what is
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
the difference it I'm just curious why
 
02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
is that uh should be held different than
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state thank you for
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
repeating that I lost my train of
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
thought um I think the opening and
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
closing dates of ohrv use throughout the
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
state is probably one of the most
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
confusing things that we have going out
 
02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:22.030 align:start position:0%
confusing things that we have going out
there

02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh you know one part of
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the State closes at this time the other
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
start part closes at this time some
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Trail is open year round this
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
Trail's open year round you know I think
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes there are other portions that are
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
open so but this once again is a is a is
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
a section that was set up and and where
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh is a destination place to go
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
um for grous hunting now certainly I
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
know people come to the Pittsburgh
 
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
October 1st and throughout and and once
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
again atving yes it may start a little
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
bit later in Pittsburgh um but certainly
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's at least a 90 days for which it
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
is open and now you have bird Hunters
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
that have um really technically three
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
weeks um from October 1 until moose
 
02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
season starts the third third week of
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
October and then you're into youth deer
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
season and then you're you're into a
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
regular muzzle loader season so really
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
this a very short window for which small
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
game for the price that they pay for the
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
price they pay to come to this area uh
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
has to to hunt those areas do I probably
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
one of the best ways to shoot a grous is
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
to wait until the snow on the ground and
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
and drive down a road and they're
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
they're sitting on a branch on the side
 
02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
of any Logging Road in Pittsburgh um but
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
once again that's not when the main
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
Hunters come and run their dogs and and
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
come to the Pittsburgh area for my
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
experience yeah can I have a follow up
 
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:54.830 align:start position:0%
experience yeah can I have a follow up
follow

02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
up uh I understand that that the trails
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
open and close at different times but
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that make sense to put this in
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
align with the rest of the state
 
02:11:07.149 --> 02:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
confusing I would agree would make it in
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
line I would not agree that this is the
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
time frame for which I if if it were up
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
to me I think that and and looking at
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishermen as as the primary
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
individuals to benefit from the
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
disclosure it would be that the state
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
would close down on on September
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
30th okay thank
 
02:11:28.679 --> 02:11:30.669 align:start position:0%
30th okay thank
you

02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
thank you C Captain correct um is there
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
anything uh just a point of
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
clarification is there anything
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictionally prohibiting uh other
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies from performing
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
um the tasks in a law enforcement sense
 
02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
that fishing game would provide in the
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
North country country or do you guys
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
have a mutual Aid agreement up there
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
where uh local police County Police they
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
can all work kind of cooperatively and
 
02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm taking your testimony from
 
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
earlier right if there is an accident or
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
something your office would still be
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
involved in that based off the um gather
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
evidence Gathering from the local um
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
authorities is that
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
correct so the agreement that I spoke
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
about earlier is our ohrv PD uh ohrv PD
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
grants so portions of the OHV fund go
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
towards it's $30 $40,000 goes towards
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement um of ohvs any Police
 
02:12:31.549 --> 02:12:31.559 align:start position:0%
Department can put in for that and they
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction within their
 
02:12:35.069 --> 02:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
municipality Coos County Sheriff's
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
Department puts in for that regularly
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
they get actually the the largest amount
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
of that fund to do enforcement um which
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
really generally is around
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um and they have and they have
 
02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
the authority as well as State Police
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh Police Department
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
um they have authority to enforce the
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
the rules within their jurisdiction and
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
they can cover the accidents that occur
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
well representative Derby representative
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
ghoul can you shut off your mic please
 
02:13:11.229 --> 02:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
my question just briefly what's the
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
speed limit on these roads that you're
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
talking about for the
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
ATVs everything's about 25 miles hour
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise marked
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
followup and followup and um uh based on
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
your um on your U you know enforcement
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
exceeded I can tell you this the the
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
cause for ohrv a and snowmobile a is the
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
biggest contributing factor is excessive
 
02:13:47.229 --> 02:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
speed and um basically inexperience so
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
yes that's probably one of the biggest
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
tickets that we write as as for
 
02:13:51.239 --> 02:13:53.790 align:start position:0%
tickets that we write as as for
excessive

02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
speed anyone new
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
Captain are these roads closed like to
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
ohvs at that time you know like
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
September 30th are all motorized
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh denied access or just the
 
02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:24.189 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh denied access or just the
ohvs

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't answer that
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
question because in my mind I can I've
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
definitely been across Cedar Stream Road
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
which is closed at times um it's
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
probably a better question for uh for
 
02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
chief renie um I can't speak to that
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
section okay thank you because he the
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned how he you
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
can hunters can bring their trucks in
 
02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
with the B you know their dogs and stuff
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't sure what if they had access
 
02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't sure what if they had access
or

02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
not that's what's confusing to me
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
there certainly are sections where you
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
can operate into those areas there are
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
other sections that are gated off um I
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
can't speak to why that is or or why it
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
isn't um but um you know certainly there
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
are times when they are open when they
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
are closed okay thank
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Davis yes thank thank
 
02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
you uh so I'm I'm still unclear if
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
there's 228 square miles of small game
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
hunting why this 10 miles of trails
 
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
which is so crucial to the economic
 
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
development of that area would would
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
much all they can speak to is that they
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of the land that that o
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
operate on is private property um
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
outside of Rockingham Trail know Jericho
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
State Park things like that so it's
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
really up to the landowner when they
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
choose to um open or Clos Trails um this
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
section even though it it does the 10
 
02:16:01.229 --> 02:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
and 1 half miles um it is under the um
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group and it was designated for
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
the sportsmen and women um you for use
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
of those those
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
individuals um and so therefore um like
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
like I said my my commission feels that
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh that it's important for those those
 
02:16:20.109 --> 02:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishermen have their their
 
02:16:22.589 --> 02:16:22.599 align:start position:0%
say and and that they and that's why
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
this section has always been closed
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
because for those hunters and
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
fishermen thank you any other questions
 
02:16:31.389 --> 02:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
captain seeing none thank you Captain
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%

much I have Keith robur the uh Coos
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
County High sheriff and um if you can
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.990 align:start position:0%
keep it less than your 10 minutes would
be

02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated I'll try to give it real
 
02:16:51.549 --> 02:16:51.559 align:start position:0%
quick uh
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
Keith robach I just got elected as high
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
Sheriff of Coos County I have been
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
working for Coos County for 27 years
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
before being Sheriff I've gone through
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
five sheriffs and when the captain
 
02:17:05.469 --> 02:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
brings up about accidents our prior
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
sheriffs fishing games expertise oh hrvs
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
snowm Beals Hunting Fishing it wasn't
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
ours so they always were under the
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
standing where let's let them do their
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
expertise so we don't mess up their
 
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
accident reports is the new sheriff in
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
town I'm going to change that and I'm
 
02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
hoping with fishing game we can go
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
through send some of our guys for
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
training with them on
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
accidents major accidents I mean fatals
 
02:17:33.389 --> 02:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
that's their expertise but our guys will
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
be there and they are going to cover
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
accidents this year it is great they do
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
give us funding through the Grant I
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
think we got a little under 10,000 last
 
02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:44.599 align:start position:0%
year um the county puts a substantial
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
amount in so the county will give us
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
20,000 pit Patrol fishing game so we got
 
02:17:49.439 --> 02:17:51.309 align:start position:0%
20,000 pit Patrol fishing game so we got
$330,000

02:17:51.309 --> 02:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
$330,000
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the summertime we put three guys out
 
02:17:56.349 --> 02:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
designated just for ohb to help these
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
guys because when it first started it
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
was like the wild west up there and
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
without all the agencies coming together
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
it would have been a cluster I think
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
we've done a great job our rentals were
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of our issues um we've hammered
 
02:18:13.309 --> 02:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
down on rental companies and they have
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
been great to work with when we write
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
their guys tickets that they rent to
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're very glad they actually tell
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
them if you're speeding you're going to
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
get a ticket um jurisdiction wise we
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction throughout the whole
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
state can make an arrest right here in
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
conquer whether that Pittsburgh Nashua
 
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
we stay in Coos County you know but we
 
02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
do have the ability our guys do arrest
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
um we do a lot of trolls I think last
 
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
year our guys rolled about 238 Summoners
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
and about 680 warnings just on
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
ohbs and we've been seeing a lot of
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
increase where people stay in gorm and
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's their starting point destination
 
02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.349 align:start position:0%
that's their starting point destination
Pittsburgh

02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
so and our guys sometimes stop them on
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
their way up and stop them on their way
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
back so they go to Pittsburgh stay
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
overnight in a hotel or cabin or
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and then on Sunday they drive
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
back and come back to gorm and come back
 
02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
home so we are going to be out we are
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to make sure I have
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
at least three guys if it does get open
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
for those 10 days or whenever the trail
 
02:19:15.389 --> 02:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
is open designated up there I was on the
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
phone with Chief duie from Pittsburgh
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
and he supports it and his guys are
 
02:19:22.589 --> 02:19:22.599 align:start position:0%
going to do the same thing as
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you Sheriff any other
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
sheriff representative Sergeant uh thank
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just Sheriff uh a quick
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
question so I I didn't hear you say
 
02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
either way I'm assuming that you're in
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation yes we we're
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
in support of it we're going to support
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
it we're going to patrol
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
it what do you think the economic cost
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
to you with the extra co uh patrols will
 
02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:51.550 align:start position:0%
to you with the extra co uh patrols will
be

02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
the economic cost your department for
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
the extra patrols luckily for us we use
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of we call them part-time
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
full-time people so these are retired
 
02:20:01.870 --> 02:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
full-time guys that work part-time for
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
us and they have so many hours they can
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
work so we actually don't have to pay
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
time and a half for those we will
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
because our full-time guys will be out
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
there doing it as well but I mean on a
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
weekend you know they're
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
getting 30 bucks an hour and they're
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
putting 10 20 hours in you know so you
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
take three guys it costs money but it
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
cost money to make money and I think
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's very important for Coos and for the
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and Co-op that provide you
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
know Pittsburgh we don't want them on an
 
02:20:33.479 --> 02:20:36.630 align:start position:0%
know Pittsburgh we don't want them on an
island

02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%

Headwaters Forest uh did was I the

company didn't have uh and had a plan to
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
speak today but I did just want to uh
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
make a slight correction to the
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
company's position on this legislation
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
our uh Partners at dncr they did
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
correctly note that uh the company is
 
02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
very cool to the expansion of trails on
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
the property but on the issue of
 
02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
extending the season the company has no
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
position and so I just wanted to make
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
make that
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
distinction thank you any
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions the
 
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you very much
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.309 --> 02:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
Rober hello my name is coren Rober I'm
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
the owner of bay Rock adventures in
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh New Hampshire um so I'm I'm
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
the face of what you're talking about um
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
my business is motorized Sports started
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
out with a TV rentals in front of my
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
house used to live down in the North
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
Conway area and owned a restaurant
 
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to get to an area that was more
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
remote and had more Trail access Mo both
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling and
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
atving um our business started in
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
2013 we started out with 10
 
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
ATVs we now have 50 and 50 snow machines
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
which may sound like an enormous impact
 
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
on the area in regard to noise and more
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
people but the reality of it is is that
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
we have 15 employees in an area that has
 
02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
800 people that live there so 15
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
employees that are full-time that's a
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
big deal when you lose Seasons or pots
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
of a season for instance last winter and
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
this is relative to ohrv because they're
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
all connected you we may have what seems
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
like year round but the reality is we
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
have 6 months of operation and then need
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
to fill 6 months of payments with bills
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
and employment pay so last year our
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
season was to begin December 15th which
 
02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
is when the trails open for the winter
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
we open January
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
11th we still have payments we still
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
have employees typically we run through
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
to the end of March possibly April 15th
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
we closed March
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
1st to put that in dollar figures for
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
you in a small business that equates to
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
$175,000 of lost
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
income often times we don't open on
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day for ohrv because of
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
$75,000 when you close 30 days or sorry
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
13 days you close on the 30th of
 
02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.670 align:start position:0%
13 days you close on the 30th of
September

02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
September
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
the adjoining Town colbrook stays open
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
so we're literally talking about a
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
10-mile Trail if you do the math that's
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
7.7 acres of
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
land that's what we're talking about to
 
02:24:41.389 --> 02:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
NE connect one system to the next so
 
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh's gas stations retail
 
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
locations rental locations lodging
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
establishments food
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
they all lose and I'll put another
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
dollar to that because we have the
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
ability actually to take our rental
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
business and move it to our Campground
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
that is in
 
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
stewartown it's not ideal you try moving
 
02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:08.990 align:start position:0%
stewartown it's not ideal you try moving
50

02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
machines to another location for
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 8 to 13
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
days do the math lots of trips lots of
 
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:20.910 align:start position:0%
days do the math lots of trips lots of
gas

02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
gas
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of money when we shut down our
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
retail store shuts down for that period
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
of time that equates to about
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
$150,000 that's a lot of money for a
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
small business when what we're talking
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
about is for you to just say this
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make an ounce of
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
sense what's going on here we're not
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
looking at who can do what we've been
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
asked to do reports when we have
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
accidents by fishing games because they
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
can't get there we do our
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
part I collect registrations and sell
 
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
the decals $60,000 last month we sent to
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
the fishing
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
gang a thousand of it granted the
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
seasons change a thousand of it was for
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
license the rest were for snowmobile
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
registrations so we typically collect
 
02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.389 align:start position:0%
registrations so we typically collect
about

02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
$275,000 worth of
 
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
registrations in a year
 
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
we don't make money on that we lose
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
money on that so what we have to do is
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have to make money where we can make
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
money so we're asking you to give us
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
next year it's 13
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
days we would close on a Tuesday but we
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
want two
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
weekends you try paying
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
payroll for 11 weeks when you don't have
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
that income anymore it's not a joke it's
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
a big
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
deal we do have other things that we can
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
collect off of so we start Ecom but the
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
reality is this this Pittsburgh
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is what we are living off
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
of my husband was in the logging
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
industry since he was 16 he had to get
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
out because it's
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
collapsing it got out three years ago
 
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
what's our business our business is bar
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
Rock Adventures living off of the land
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
living off of The Economic Opportunity
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
within the area so don't shut it down
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
just consider there's a real face and
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just the rental agents we work
 
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
with the authorities we work with land
 
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
owners we work with the town we own 700
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
Acres those Hunters are all over our
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
properties they don't stop hunting
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere else but on this seven
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
acres like that makes no sense granted
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
they may be processes and granted we may
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
be asking for a process that doesn't
 
02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
seem as it it aligns with what you think
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
should happen but does that make any
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
sense either when this can happen and it
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
matters does anybody have any questions
 
02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.510 align:start position:0%
matters does anybody have any questions
for

02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you for being here today
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
um is there any sort of Chamber of
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce or Business Association in your
 
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
town that has taken a stance on this do
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
you have any stance of that I'm
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
currently not involved in the Chamber of
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
Commerce but I was for over seven years
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay and The Stance is that economically
 
02:28:31.630 --> 02:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
is the greatest impact on the area at
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
that point in which I was involved I did
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
a short study with the real estate
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
agents in the area and then again
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we own several hundred acres and
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
my husband has been in logging for a
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
long time we also do real estate devel
 
02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
development on a small on a residential
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
piece 80% of all properties that were
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
sold were sold because they were
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
connected to Trail systems both
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
snowmobile and ATV that's a
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
reality that's yeah representor
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
Bridal thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question today sure uh
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
thir 2013 is when you said you started
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
yes that's a long time have you found
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
that over um over over a decade worth of
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
being in business up there when you lose
 
02:29:17.309 --> 02:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
a holiday weekend like Memorial Day
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
Weekend the amount of and and that's due
 
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
to weather correct to have an arbitrary
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
date of September 30th um where you
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
could have another holiday weekend 8 13
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
days later that that additional holiday
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
would make up for a loss of a holiday
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
weekend at the beginning of the season
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
so like the the amount of money that is
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
brought in by a holiday weekend is worth
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
more than just having an arbitrary date
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the end of the month yes so let me
 
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
get that straight you're asking me if we
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
lose a one end do we do I think that the
 
02:29:54.429 --> 02:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
extension of that season would help
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
offset that loss absolutely one of the
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
things that happens is Memorial Day
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
weekend can often be impacted by the
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
snow level we don't have that typically
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the middle at at the beginning of
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
October to the middle of October so yes
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
anything that we can get we need and if
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
you do remember correctly the past two
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
seasons for o rving we' had several
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
closedowns due to um rain that was
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
impacting the trail systems um so some
 
02:30:22.510 --> 02:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
people one of which was one of my
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
lodging establishment that you could not
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
access on the trails so yes if we can
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
gain 10 or 13 days on the other end
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely it matters you're
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions for the
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
speak seeing none thank you for your
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:30:43.950 --> 02:30:43.960 align:start position:0%

02:30:43.960 --> 02:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
you in favor of the bill Darren Darren
jock

02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
um most of my points have been brought
 
02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
out here but I would like to just touch
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
on a couple of things that are that are
 
02:31:09.279 --> 02:31:10.110 align:start position:0%
on a couple of things that are that are
very

02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
important um obviously October 1st is
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
the same all the way through the state
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
as far as hunting goes
 
02:31:22.910 --> 02:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
and for 10 miles I that's that can't
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
even be a
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
consideration for what
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're this we we brought this to be this
 
02:31:33.309 --> 02:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
last summer we we have a new land owner
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
the the Perry stream property was is
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
about 8,000 acres is our primary trail
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
system that we're talking about
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
connecting to um they came to us this
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
year and asked if we could keep it open
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
through Columbus Day so we met with our
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
town Selectmen and they unanimously
 
02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
agreed this spring to go on board with
 
02:31:55.269 --> 02:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
this so we brought this decisions to
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
Trails Bureau uh June 1st we requested
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
this so
 
02:32:04.990 --> 02:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
um when this this April 1 date that
 
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
they've talked about just came to be
 
02:32:10.429 --> 02:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
this fall so we will be pursuing this as
 
02:32:13.630 --> 02:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
well um again in April if we have to uh
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's a shame it's got to come to
 
02:32:17.309 --> 02:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
legislation the state of New Hampshire
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
owns those roads we spent $40 million is
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
to get the rights to those roads um and
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
we should be able to to make this a very
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
simple process um I'm on the board of
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
directors for the great Northwoods
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
Riders and I also own a business in town
 
02:32:36.309 --> 02:32:36.319 align:start position:0%

02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
Country resources Recreation
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
development this would probably be inim
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
study but why are we confining ourselves
 
02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
to a 10mile trail when we should be
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
expanding the entire North Country Coos
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
County anything north of Lake wiip
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
why do we not have worldclass
 
02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:21.630 align:start position:0%
why do we not have worldclass
snowmobile

02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
snowmobile
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
races why do we not have dog sled races
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
going from Berlin to
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
Montreal why do we not have a train that
 
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
comes from Montreal to Berlin and why
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
would you go to Berlin because you got a
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.190 --> 02:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
manufactures Ste mobiles the Berlin
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
bomber if you will what we want to do in
 
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion Mr chairman we want to expand
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
our thinking there's no reason why the
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
fish and game department should be in
 
02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
here opposing this bill there's no
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
reason why people who say we need
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
conservation should be opposing this
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill there's no reason for anybody to be
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill what we are looking
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
for is economic development of
 
02:35:18.359 --> 02:35:19.950 align:start position:0%
for is economic development of
everything

02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
the bird Hunter who goes bird hunting is
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%

that let's get some great great
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
development going on in the north
 
02:36:21.870 --> 02:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
county I I I just can Envision with the
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
effort a major effort being put in and
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
by this committee I might
 
02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
add this committee is
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
specifically what are we looking at
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
resources Recreation
 
02:36:37.469 --> 02:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
development this committee could be the
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
most exciting Committee in the entire
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislature uh barrowing Finance of
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
course Mr Gorman I appreciate your
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
passion I can see it from this far away
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
but can you keep your comments to this
 
02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I thought I was Mr chairman in
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
addressing the people who were opposing
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't see why they're
 
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
opposing if we include them into a
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
development and specifically to answer
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
your question Mr chairman if this bill
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
was to put on inm
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
study we could take those two instead of
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
killing it as we usually do instead of
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we could add
 
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
develop with the fishing game with the
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
conservation people develop a worldclass
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
organization up here in the North
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
Country so I may be drifting off the
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
specific of the bill but I see this
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for this bill so
 
02:37:43.950 --> 02:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what I have to say um
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm very glad that I came today to

02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
we're including everybody um I think
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great way to go and this is not
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
a Democrat Republican bill this is a
 
02:38:01.389 --> 02:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
people of the North Country development
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
Bill if you're getting on a lift ticket
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
I don't say uh are you a democrat or a
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
republican you want the family day pass

that's what I'm interested the economy
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
of the area so I may have drifted I
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
apologize for that Mr chairman but I
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%

a pink card that wants to talk about
 
02:38:32.279 --> 02:38:34.990 align:start position:0%
a pink card that wants to talk about
hb17

02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
hb17
 
02:38:37.870 --> 02:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
FN yeah you need to fill a pink card out
 
02:38:41.070 --> 02:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
but you can take the seat and tell us if
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
against no you won should speak so we
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
can move on on hi my name is St
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
wi hi my name is Steven Wilkey I
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire off highway
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle association we're the
 
02:39:01.469 --> 02:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
association of the 23 clubs um I was not
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to speak on this bill but I'll
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
make it quick it's very hard to compare
 
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing licenses which are
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
for an individual person to machine
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
registrations a lot of our machines now
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
carry two four or six people so
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
comparing those numbers are apples to
 
02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:19.870 align:start position:0%
comparing those numbers are apples to
oranges

02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
oranges
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
and I would I would caution against that
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
um Nova does support this in that it
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
would universalize the closing date
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
above Route
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
26 and it make it very clear that above
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
Route 26 it closes at Columbus Day Above
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
The Notches closes uh October 31 and it
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
would then very universalize the closing
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
dates up there at that is it any
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you if you
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
could just fill in the pink card and
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
up on the blue
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
Sergeant seven in
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%

02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing on House Bill 127 FM
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
closed we'll move immediately on to uh
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
174 and calling up the prime sponsor uh
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
again thank you uh Mr chair and thank
 
02:40:56.110 --> 02:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
you committee members I'll be very brief
 
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
HB 174 basically changes the definition
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
of an
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
ORV uh taking the weight which is
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
currently of uh 2100 lb to 3500
 
02:41:13.469 --> 02:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
lb the reason to do that is um
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
basically their orvs are getting a
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
little more fancy little more sophis
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
icated there's some out there now with
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
air conditioning and heaters and
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
electric windows and they've gotten a
 
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
little bit heavier so they're a little
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
bit over the current weight
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
limit the second thing that is important
 
02:41:34.429 --> 02:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to give the ability for
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers to allow and produce
 
02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers to allow and produce
electric

02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
electric
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
ATVs so if someone is very you know
 
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
environmentally conscious it's going to
 
02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
allow them to do it the batteries are
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
heavy we need the extra weight in the
 
02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
definition um this um this law I mean
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I brought it in uh at the
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
request of the New Hampshire off highway
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle association
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
Nova um but as far as ohbs and
 
02:42:07.469 --> 02:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
dimensions there's a limit in the state
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire depending on the trail
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
system of no more than 65 Ines in
 
02:42:13.389 --> 02:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
certain areas other areas no more than
 
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
50 Ines this doesn't change anything
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
nothing is changing except the
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
um we discussed this quickly for a few
 
02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
minutes uh a couple months ago at the um
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
commission to study uh ohrv in New
 
02:42:35.710 --> 02:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um the director or I
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
should say the the uh exact title is but
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
the head of Bureau Trails said he felt
 
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
that the change in weight would not have
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
significant wear on the
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
Trails um and I think that
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
um you're going to have a little
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
testimony after that shows that the
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and the tire manufacturers
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
have um Incorporated new designs and
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies to reduce uh Trail
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
wear but again as I had mentioned
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
earlier no matter what kind of trail
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
system you have the land owners are the
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
key to have a trail system without
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative land owners you don't have
 
02:43:15.389 --> 02:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
anything clubs have um access to what we
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
call Grant nade through the bureau
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
trails and that's uh money that goes
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
grants that go to the clubs to help
 
02:43:26.190 --> 02:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
maintain trails and like my club again
 
02:43:30.030 --> 02:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
up in the in cook we have some uh trails
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we use on logging
 
02:43:35.710 --> 02:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
roads and getting that um Grant aid
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
helps us to maintain those roads when
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
required and just for information you
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
know we put out in 2024 over 100 dump
 
02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
truck loads of gravel on our Trails as
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance not building
 
02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
um so I think that um our land owners if
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
they the ATVs have much less PSI
 
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
footprint compared to cars trucks uh any
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
other vehicle uh I don't think that the
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
extra th000 pounds is going to be
 
02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
significant uh to tr Trail damage and um
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
I would ask the land owners to please uh
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh communicate with the local clubs and
 
02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh they stay happy and
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
local clubs will work with them to
 
02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
maintained questions I see on my right
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you for taking my question
 
02:44:34.110 --> 02:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um how is this enforced what
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
is the enforcement mechanism for the
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
weights really there isn't okay uh
 
02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game of course is Primary Law
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
Enforcement but I don't think they're
 
02:44:46.349 --> 02:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
equipped to do U any kind of weighing um
 
02:44:49.469 --> 02:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
and and like I said Nova has uh proposed
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
this and it was just to be upfront and
 
02:44:56.349 --> 02:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh to be keep everybody legal so that
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
there isn't a problem you know we're not
 
02:44:58.910 --> 02:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
trying to hide anything behind the
 
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
curtain uh where things are getting
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
heavier or or we want to support the
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that that want to bring
 
02:45:06.590 --> 02:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
out uh battery battery powered and
 
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
utvs

02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
utvs
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
Bridal thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question you have to excuse my
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
ignorance I'm not ohrv Enthusiast um
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to registration of these
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh I know certain vehicles that
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
are on our roadways get um higher fees
 
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
for a higher weight due to the impact on
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
the roads is there any sort of uh
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
proposed higher fee that is attached to
 
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
this or is that something that was
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
considered is that not considered at all
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
in in uh when when this was created part
 
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
from your testimony from your experience
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
everybody um in the ohrv world whether
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's a side by side or or or a
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
four-wheeler they pay the same same
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
registration um is it um an idea yes is
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
it out of the question I mean it's got
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
to come to legislature and we can we can
 
02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it but uh at this time
 
02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
everything everybody pays an eval
 
02:46:16.510 --> 02:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
fee any other questions representative
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman uh representative
 
02:46:22.750 --> 02:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
is this build to compensate for the
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
weight of the batteries or for the size
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the machine to answer your question
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
precisely it's for the weight of the
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
batteries the size of the machines uh
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
has is not a consideration in this we
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to change the size of
 
02:46:42.510 --> 02:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
machines we do not um we want to keep
 
02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
the widths the same so because a lot of
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
trails are gated so we we want to have
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
ohvs and side by side on on Gates uh on
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
Trails but we don't want jeeps we don't
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
want trucks we don't want other vehicles
 
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of them are gated at 65 Ines so
 
02:47:01.309 --> 02:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
the that's why the state law is maximum
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
65 Ines and some of the trails in
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County they're only or and I
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
think up in towards Sullivan County are
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
only 50 in but it's totally for weight
 
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
not for Dimension yeah okay thank you
 
02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:16.429 align:start position:0%
not for Dimension yeah okay thank you
representative

02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
ghoul our battery are operated ohvs
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
quiet versus the other
 
02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.389 align:start position:0%
quiet versus the other
kind

02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
extremely any other
 
02:47:34.429 --> 02:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
Taylor for gasoline powered ATVs at this
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
3500 lb weight what would be the uh
 
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
approximate average horsepower and
 
02:47:45.309 --> 02:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
maximum speed of that
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
unit when we uh and I had mentioned
 
02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
earlier some of the fancier ones coming
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
through with the air conditioning and
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
heat and that sort of thing um most of
 
02:47:57.309 --> 02:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
the ones the manufacturers are on that
 
02:48:01.389 --> 02:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
platform it's about uh 100 horsepower
 
02:48:03.870 --> 02:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
and um most of
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
those I'm going to guess top speed is
 
02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
maybe 70 M an hour but as a reminder the
 
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
25 representative diary thank you Mr
 
02:48:21.150 --> 02:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative pette um I was reading
 
02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
last night that um and I think it was
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that in many cases 90%
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the trails are private um what do the
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh land owners think about the increased
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh weight and are there would this
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
require renegotiation of the um
 
02:48:42.190 --> 02:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
agreements with the land owners for this
 
02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:46.429 align:start position:0%
agreements with the land owners for this
increased

02:48:46.429 --> 02:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
weight the clubs uh can't speak for the
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
whole state but I know the clubs up
 
02:48:55.230 --> 02:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
north um really have a an honest and
 
02:48:59.349 --> 02:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the um with
 
02:49:01.150 --> 02:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
the land owners of course uh I know for
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
my cobber club we have 120 miles of
 
02:49:07.150 --> 02:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
trail and I think we have 108 land
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the they will if this passes they will
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
be notified but um according to the
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
studies I've seen and I think that my
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
friend from Nova will bring us some
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
statistics that as far as uh ground
 
02:49:28.950 --> 02:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
disturbance um it's insignificant
 
02:49:33.309 --> 02:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
else uh thank you Mr chairman Mr
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative as a prime sponsor I'm
 
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're familiar with the
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
the language in here uh I'm hearing two
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
main purposes one is for Ev batteries
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
but the language is not limited to 3500
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
pounds for an EV ohrv right it's just
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
for all ohvs so I'm assuming that it's I
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
I do like the batteries obviously but
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it's also for the the
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
fancier ohvs like you said and I'll
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
explain a part of it
 
02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
myself I have a standard off
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
theot uh OHV side by side it's a Polaris
 
02:50:18.269 --> 02:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
General it's not very fast it's kind of
 
02:50:18.279 --> 02:50:19.750 align:start position:0%
General it's not very fast it's kind of
comfortable

02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
02:50:21.389 --> 02:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
um and after I bought it I put I put a
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
winch on it and I put a windshield and a
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
winch wiper and I put a heater and uh I
 
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
put um a spare tire carrier on the back
 
02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I put a spare tire on it and I carry
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
a tool box I carry a recovery box which
 
02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
got some straps and winches you know
 
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
stuff if I get stuck and and a jack and
 
02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
I carry a cooler I'm over 2100 lb
 
02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:50.950 align:start position:0%
I carry a cooler I'm over 2100 lb
so

02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm I have nothing fancy but legally
 
02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:56.750 align:start position:0%
um I'm I have nothing fancy but legally
I'm

02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:50:59.190 --> 02:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
overweight and of course I'm not the
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
world anyone new representative
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
Bridal thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
02:51:13.070 --> 02:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
for the followup um in in that regard is
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
there anybody
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
um I'll cut right to the chase do some
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the law enforcement vehicles that are
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
out there with all their extra equipment
 
02:51:23.469 --> 02:51:23.479 align:start position:0%
added equipment or say first other First
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
Responders Fire EMS some of their um
 
02:51:28.269 --> 02:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
setups that they have to operate in the
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
North Country would they be similarly
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
equipped uh and therefore overweight
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
currently in your
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
opinion I I know I can tell you what I
 
02:51:42.389 --> 02:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
know uh the city of Berlin has their own
 
02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
ohvs that they uh patrolling the trails
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
they are overweight the Coos County
 
02:51:51.389 --> 02:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department on their ohvs are
 
02:51:54.110 --> 02:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
overweight um fishing game I don't know
 
02:51:56.590 --> 02:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen them out on the trails to
 
02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
to know exactly what they're riding but
 
02:51:59.469 --> 02:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
yeah some of the law enforcement guys
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
are definitely overweight by Teddy's uh
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
definition representative Ryan thank you
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um can you
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
explain unladen dry weight to me I'm not
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with that
 
02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
term it says 35,000 pounds unladen dry
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
weight in the right so
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
um when uh the
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers build a unit they weigh it
 
02:52:27.389 --> 02:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
and said this is the weight and unladen
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
dry weight mean that there's no oil in
 
02:52:32.990 --> 02:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
it no gas no fluids of any kind no
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
operator Bare Bones that's what it
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.990 --> 02:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
built anyone else for a
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
question s yes representative Darby
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
So reading the bill um there are you
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
know 215
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
a434 state starts out by saying that
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
ohvs can um uh cannot be over a th000
 
02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
pounds on state owned Trails except for
 
02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
and then there's a couple of exceptions
 
02:53:12.229 --> 02:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
Coos County another area that I'm not
 
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with and Jericho Mountain which
 
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
you took me on last year or earlier so I
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um how how many trails
 
02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
are we actually talking about here uh
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
that would um that are 35,000 3500
 
02:53:28.830 --> 02:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
pounds versus the
 
02:53:31.710 --> 02:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
Thousand I can speak
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
um for the North Country which is what I
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
know from gorm North and Northern
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
Grafton County which is from maybe uh
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
Lisbon North um that those are the
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
trails we're talking about it's probably
 
02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
a little over th000 miles um when you
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
get to the rocking inam County Trails I
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
believe those are only 50 in so that
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
would you'd never have anything 50 in
 
02:53:54.790 --> 02:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
wide that would be that heavy and I
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
think that some around the Claremont
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
area same thing that the trails a little
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
bit narrower so it wouldn't have any
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
County seeing no one else thank you for
 
02:54:12.229 --> 02:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony well I want to thank the
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
um the chair and the committee for uh
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
tolerating me today and it's been a
 
02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:21.229 align:start position:0%
tolerating me today and it's been a
pleasure

02:54:21.229 --> 02:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
ianco sorry it's good afternoon
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
now um I'm Abby Veno from gorum New
 
02:54:40.349 --> 02:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh this bill changes the
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
allowed weight of utvs on certain State
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
lands to increase by
 
02:54:48.429 --> 02:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
75% while HP 174 directly applies only
 
02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
to State Property which is about 200 mil
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
of Trail it will impact every landowner
 
02:54:55.150 --> 02:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
whose property connects with State
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
Trails um in North Stratford alone 150
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
land owners allow ohrv Trails on their
 
02:55:05.070 --> 02:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
property HB 174 has no Provisions for
 
02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
any notification or in input from land
 
02:55:10.590 --> 02:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
owners or towns about this weight crease
 
02:55:13.309 --> 02:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
because ATV trails also go over town
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
roads class 5 class
 
02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
six um and uh meanwhile both land owners
 
02:55:23.229 --> 02:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
and ohrv clubs alike have expressed
 
02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
concerned at the degraded state of the
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
trails the uh inability of the bureau
 
02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
Trails despite their best efforts to
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
maintain them properly and the
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
increasing severity of storms so a
 
02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
drastic increase in allowed weight won't
 
02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
that speed up erosion and where will the
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
money come to repair more damaged Trails
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about the uh Titan
 
02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
budget that New Hampshire is
 
02:55:50.910 --> 02:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
facing um a recurring theme of the peace
 
02:55:53.790 --> 02:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
meal ohrv legislation is that the
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
property owners most impacted by the
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
changes in law are not notified or
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
considered or asked for their opinion on
 
02:56:04.429 --> 02:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
the issue if you truly want to reduce
 
02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
the complaints around ohrv Recreation
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
then it's time to stop the peacemeal
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
approach let the ohrv study commission
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
continue its work we're supposed to uh
 
02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
submit a report and legislative proposal
 
02:56:20.590 --> 02:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
by November 1st of every year and we
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
have our final report is due November
 
02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:24.910 align:start position:0%
have our final report is due November
1st

02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
1st
 
02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
2026 uh we our our commission is diverse
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're big um and let us do our work and
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
propose a workable bipartisan leg
 
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislation bring up some of the good
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised here so
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
please itl this bill or send it to the
 
02:56:45.150 --> 02:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
study commission for evaluation thank
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
you questions for the speaker
 
02:56:51.590 --> 02:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
02:56:54.269 --> 02:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
Abby speaking in support of the bill
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
Stephen I can't read the end of your
 
02:57:05.710 --> 02:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
Wilkins hi thank you uh for hearing us
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
um as I said earlier my name is Steven
 
02:57:14.429 --> 02:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
Wilkey I represent New Hampshire off
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
highway vehicle association who is 23
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh one of each need to go to everybody
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's multiple letters of support
 
02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
there um so we represent 23 clubs ohrv
 
02:57:34.030 --> 02:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
clubs in New Hampshire uh and about
 
02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
15,000 members um we pro pro promoted
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation because the original
 
02:57:45.710 --> 02:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
UTV definition which is different than
 
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
the ohrv definition in New Hampshire was
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
created over 15 years ago when they were
 
02:57:58.229 --> 02:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
truly utilitarian vehicles uh mule or
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
Gator John Deere Gator Kawasaki Mule
 
02:58:04.830 --> 02:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
made for the Ranch in Texas over the
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
last 15 years our machines have evolved
 
02:58:13.229 --> 02:58:13.239 align:start position:0%
into severe recreational usage and along
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
with that has come four seat vehicles
 
02:58:21.389 --> 02:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
enclosed C tabs heat and AC and when
 
02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
they started adding the heat and AC they
 
02:58:27.630 --> 02:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
started going over the 2,000 pound dry
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
weight limit and um there have been
 
02:58:33.550 --> 02:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
these vehicles out on the trails for the
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
last four or five years the gas powered
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
ones as we studied um I I also do sit on
 
02:58:43.469 --> 02:58:43.479 align:start position:0%
the 1188 study commission and I am also
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
president of the Sullivan County ATV
 
02:58:49.150 --> 02:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
Club in Claremont so
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
um as we we studied this these vehicles
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
are getting out there because there is
 
02:58:59.950 --> 02:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
no um enforcement of the weight limit um
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has done a really good job
 
02:59:05.790 --> 02:59:05.800 align:start position:0%
over the years of defining our o hrvs we
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
have a separate definition for trail
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
bikes which are ride on Two Wheel
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicles we have a a definition for ATVs
 
02:59:20.030 --> 02:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is up to 1,000 and 50 in wide we
 
02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
have a definition of utvs which has been
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
originally 62 in and 2,000 lb in 2014
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
the 62 in went to 65 in so we've already
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted this definition um and and now
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
we are at the point where we need to
 
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
adjust it again um interesting also is
 
02:59:48.750 --> 02:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
jeeps and trucks are considered Ohr vs
 
02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
when operated off from a public way so
 
02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
on our landowner permission forms there
 
03:00:00.229 --> 03:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
are four boxes trail bikes ATVs utvs and
 
03:00:02.830 --> 03:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
jeeps and trucks so we have had actually
 
03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
land owners checking off jeeps and
 
03:00:07.950 --> 03:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
trucks on their own property so those
 
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
are getting out on some properties um
 
03:00:13.630 --> 03:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
also when a municipality opens their
 
03:00:16.830 --> 03:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
class six roads or class five roads um
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
they often open them to ohvs which don't
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a width or weight limit
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
because conventional Motor Vehicles are
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
on those roads also the class six roads
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we often are considered Trails we
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
have um uh tractor trailers on them
 
03:00:39.550 --> 03:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
because the logging um and very heavy
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
equipment my local Club suvin County ATV
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
Club we just put a bridge on a Class 6
 
03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
Road it was a 60,000 pound Bridge we uh
 
03:00:52.830 --> 03:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
as an organization and Bureau Trails
 
03:00:55.269 --> 03:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
have encouraged clubs when they update
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
Bridges to make them so that you can put
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
heavy equipment across the bridge to
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
take the and maintain the trails so when
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
we put a 60,000 lb bridge in on a Class
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
6 Road um I met with the logger this
 
03:01:11.950 --> 03:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
summer he's like H in the future when
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
you do a bridge make sure it's 120,000
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
lbs so we can get full logging trucks
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
across there
 
03:01:22.030 --> 03:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
so the the logging industry it will do
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know a lot more weight than this
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
1500 lb weight raise uh that we're
 
03:01:30.990 --> 03:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
looking at and and a lot of talk has
 
03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
been about the electric machines coming
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
down the road and while they have just
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
started to get to the public um the
 
03:01:43.150 --> 03:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are working on detuning
 
03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
the electric so they don't have as much
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
impact the other letters that were um
 
03:01:52.269 --> 03:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
passed around with you um we have one
 
03:01:54.030 --> 03:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
letter from Roa which is the
 
03:01:56.830 --> 03:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
recreational Highway Vehicle Association
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the whole country many other states
 
03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
are aligning their UTV definition to
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
3500 PBS and uh there's at least four
 
03:02:08.110 --> 03:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
other states that are doing that
 
03:02:10.990 --> 03:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
currently so that letter will show that
 
03:02:13.469 --> 03:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
support uh we also have a letter of
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
support from Polaris Polaris is the
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
number one manufacturer of op High
 
03:02:21.870 --> 03:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles and um they have gone to
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
extensive uh educ uh engineering to
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
engineer these machines to have a
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
lighter footprint on the ground they
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
have employed the uh tire manufacturers
 
03:02:39.550 --> 03:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
to to develop better off highway vehicle
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
tires which are low pressure wider
 
03:02:47.309 --> 03:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
better tread compounds and better tread
 
03:02:47.319 --> 03:02:48.510 align:start position:0%
better tread compounds and better tread
patterns

03:02:48.510 --> 03:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
patterns
 
03:02:53.950 --> 03:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
for on and off pavement um so these uh
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
letters of support and the chart
 
03:02:59.229 --> 03:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
explaining the off highway vehicle tires
 
03:03:03.389 --> 03:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
versus a conventional Auto uh Tire um
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
shows how less impactful just 1,500 lb
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
more will be so um I will keep it short
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
and appreciate you listening to my
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and and we answer any
 
03:03:21.150 --> 03:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:28.550 --> 03:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just wondered if
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
you could Supply us with a vehicle um
 
03:03:35.950 --> 03:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
with a picture so that we would be able
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
to tell what the difference in size is
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
and what each of these vehicles look
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
like that will we be voting on so in
 
03:03:46.110 --> 03:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
other words if we're at 2,000 lb now
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
what is the size of that vehicle and if
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're at 3500 lb then what is the size
 
03:03:52.670 --> 03:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:03:56.269 --> 03:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle size will not change our maximum
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
width is 65 in that is enforced by
 
03:04:03.870 --> 03:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
weight width limiting devices on state
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
land um so the actual physical
 
03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
dimensions of the vehicle will not get
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
any larger with this definition change
 
03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
only the weight of the vehicle so I we
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
can gather some pictures and we can
 
03:04:22.269 --> 03:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
email them off to the to committee so
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
differences representative NAB thank you
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I know you don't repres
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I know
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
you don't represent Roba but they
 
03:04:35.469 --> 03:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned 80 Ines as a width in their
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
letter is that a future goal no not at
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
all we we will never go wider than 65
 
03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
because as soon as you get to 68 in now
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
you're getting into some of the Jeeps
 
03:04:49.590 --> 03:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
and trucks and we don't want them on
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
these designated Trails the 65 in is
 
03:04:57.229 --> 03:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
been an accepted width um for the
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh they do make a 50in
 
03:05:04.670 --> 03:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
side by side uh UTV which goes on the
 
03:05:07.870 --> 03:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
state trails in Central and Southern
 
03:05:11.229 --> 03:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
parts and you know those uh state laws
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
that uh talk about 50 in uh other than
 
03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
grafting Coos is really only on state
 
03:05:20.349 --> 03:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
owned land the private land owners and
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the choice to allow
 
03:05:26.429 --> 03:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
larger machines so at solivan County we
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
have um about 45 miles that allow um uh
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
utvs and only the 9 Mile Sugar River
 
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
Rail Trail which is state owned is 50 in
 
03:05:42.190 --> 03:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh and we have about 20 mil of class six
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
roads which jeeps and trucks are out
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
there with the High Press tires and in
 
03:05:50.429 --> 03:05:50.439 align:start position:0%
all honesty the Jeeps and trucks do the
 
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
most damage versus any of our machines
 
03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:55.349 align:start position:0%
most damage versus any of our machines
thank

03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:05:58.510 --> 03:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:06:01.070 --> 03:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
Baldwin thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
question as I understand
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
it one of the benefits of increasing the
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
poundage would be to accommodate
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
electric batteries is that correct that
 
03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
benefits we're talking about the North
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
country and people in the North Country
 
03:06:31.790 --> 03:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
have a hard time plugging in an electric
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle because there's nowhere to plug
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
them in in the North
 
03:06:41.150 --> 03:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
country where would these um electric
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles be plugged in where would you
 
03:06:45.790 --> 03:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
get the power there's no infrastructure
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:06:50.110 --> 03:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question um part
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
of uh the 1188 study commission is to
 
03:06:57.429 --> 03:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
study electric charging stations at
 
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
Trail heads um but we often like in
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
Jericho we've got five big wooden
 
03:07:06.389 --> 03:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
turbines up there making a bunch of uh
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
Power uh they could be plugged in there
 
03:07:11.670 --> 03:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and Out West what they have done is
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
Standalone solar uh battery packs where
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
people can plug in out in the middle of
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
wilderness um uh New Hampshire is kind
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
of a doughnut hole for electric uh all
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
the states around us have um increased
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
their electric capabilities and charging
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
capabilities and I think I just saw that
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is finally going to get on
 
03:07:38.269 --> 03:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
board and try to get more uh charging
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
stations um but the the the future is is
 
03:07:45.510 --> 03:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
in front of us and um you know while not
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be into electric
 
03:07:51.269 --> 03:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
those are going to be uh built as as
 
03:07:55.070 --> 03:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
time goes on um rivan which is a
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle um made by GM and I
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
can't remember who their other partner
 
03:08:04.710 --> 03:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
is but they have actually got many uh
 
03:08:06.429 --> 03:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
charging stations out in the middle of
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
the desert out west and um so that they
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
can take the electric vehicles from one
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
place to the other for you know
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of miles so uh you know we
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's just starting to get developed and
 
03:08:24.309 --> 03:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
solution so Mr wiy I have a question
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
sure do these vehicles because I also
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
like a fellow representative I don't
 
03:08:33.790 --> 03:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
have one of these vehicles do they have
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
a tag in it like my car that says how
 
03:08:39.150 --> 03:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
much the dry weight is in the vehicle uh
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
no they don't but every manufacturer
 
03:08:43.630 --> 03:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
when they do um it comes out on their
 
03:08:46.349 --> 03:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
spec sheet so every vehicle out there
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can look right up on the internet
 
03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
see what the dry weight is and know that
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
that is um our uh Community has been
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
trying to self- police this for uh the
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
last seven years as long as I've been
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
involved with this um as the machines
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
have gotten heavier you know one group
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
of our Riders says oh that's too too
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
heavy for our trails and um when you
 
03:09:13.389 --> 03:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
know re reality is these are the the
 
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
machines that people want um and and I
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
will put it that uh five of our land
 
03:09:23.429 --> 03:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
owners um that I know who have Trails on
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
their property already have these
 
03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
overweight machines and they are out
 
03:09:31.710 --> 03:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
there as land owners themselves thank
 
03:09:34.269 --> 03:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from Mr wiy
 
03:09:34.279 --> 03:09:36.150 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from Mr wiy
representative

03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
veale thank you Mr chair um it got my
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
curiosity when you mentioned a tag um
 
03:09:44.150 --> 03:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to get like one of
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
those tags that goes in the window that
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
says what the features are of the
 
03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:49.510 align:start position:0%
says what the features are of the
vehicle

03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:52.950 --> 03:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
the 3500 lb vehicle um just like when
 
03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
you buy an automobile isn't there
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
something that says
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's the machine is made of I'm not
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
sure the the manufacturers are willing
 
03:10:09.150 --> 03:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
or even have ever thought about that uh
 
03:10:12.229 --> 03:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking my
 
03:10:15.790 --> 03:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
question representative Darby thank you
 
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:17.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
um we you talked about the size but how
 
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
about the engine sizes between the
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
difference are they are there larger
 
03:10:26.510 --> 03:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
engines to uh you know to get these 3500
 
03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
lb uh o up to 70 M an hour and if the
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
engines are larger are the um noise at
 
03:10:35.870 --> 03:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
25 miles an hour
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
comparable so the most of the side by
 
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
sides um are between 700 CC's and 1,000
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
CC's um the the th000 CC will do 70 um
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
if you had a long straightway and you
 
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
you built up speed but um our our speed
 
03:10:58.830 --> 03:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
limit on the state owned trails are 25
 
03:11:00.590 --> 03:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh private trails that are not marked
 
03:11:04.030 --> 03:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
are are 35 but a lot of our Trails on
 
03:11:06.429 --> 03:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
private land you can't get a machine to
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
go faster than 20 or 15 miles an hour um
 
03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's really on the roads that people are
 
03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.630 --> 03:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
Trails so the the sound difference um
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
Polaris has also um been working on um
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
re uh tuning their engines through the C
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
CPUs of computers to Dune um I will tell
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
of a story out in Sedona cal um uh
 
03:11:44.990 --> 03:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
Arizona there was a rental agency and
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
when you leave the rental agency and go
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
out on the the road the the rentals
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
would always step on the gas and it
 
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
would be very loud so Polaris went in
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
there retuned that engine so it was
 
03:11:59.630 --> 03:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
quieter and it wasn't so bothersome to
 
03:12:01.630 --> 03:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
the the neighbors and now they are
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
carrying that onto a lot of these
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
machines um when a lot of the sound
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
complaints stem way back to two stroke
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
machines dirt bikes and sport quads
 
03:12:19.229 --> 03:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
those are two stroke racing machines and
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
often times when people would get those
 
03:12:23.070 --> 03:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
the first thing they would do is change
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
the exhaust which is where our our hard
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
exhaust laws came about where no
 
03:12:32.309 --> 03:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
modified exhaust that modifies it louder
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
than stock um most of these side by
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
sides and even the ATVs now are all
 
03:12:41.790 --> 03:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
fourstroke much quieter and the
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers recognize the noise
 
03:12:49.389 --> 03:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr wi
 
03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
for your T thank you very much for
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
listening and asking the questions in
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
Davis thank thank you again Mr chairman
 
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
my name still is an Davis uh and I am
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
Ino opposition to House Bill
 
03:13:29.790 --> 03:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
174 um other speakers have pointed to a
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
couple of the reasons why I oppose this
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill so I will not go down that rabbit
 
03:13:38.349 --> 03:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
hole however um one I have two
 
03:13:38.359 --> 03:13:39.630 align:start position:0%
hole however um one I have two
significant

03:13:39.630 --> 03:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:13:42.429 --> 03:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
concerns uh these vehicles would be
 
03:13:42.439 --> 03:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
concerns uh these vehicles would be
allowed

03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
on trails in coas County the amusic
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
recreational trail from haal to
 
03:13:53.070 --> 03:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem the Warren recreational trail
 
03:13:55.870 --> 03:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
in Warren in Crafton County and Jericho
 
03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
Mountain State Park so these are
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
state-owned Trails but as previous
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
speakers have acknowledged most of these
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
trails are
 
03:14:07.990 --> 03:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
connected through private
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
landowner uh
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
agreements um so my question and concern
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
is these private land owners who
 
03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:17.550 align:start position:0%
is these private land owners who
comprise

03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
comprise
 
03:14:21.309 --> 03:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
80% or more of the trail system are they
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
being advised of this potential change
 
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
and uh if they are what kind of
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
notification will they be given um and I
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
did a little research last night and
 
03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
just thinking you know 3500 lb that's a
 
03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
75% increase in these vehicles and um I
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank Mr wilky for helping to educate me
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
about uh you know the current weights
 
03:14:49.469 --> 03:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth about these
 
03:14:52.429 --> 03:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
machines um he's so knowledgeable and a
 
03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
great resource on our
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission uh but you know the curb
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
weight of a 2023 Toyota Tacoma is 3900
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
lb so one of these 3500 lb machines with
 
03:15:11.870 --> 03:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of people and the
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
cooler and the toolkit and all the rest
 
03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned about the weight and
 
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
what it will do to Trails not only in
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the states owned by the state but also
 
03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
for private land owners
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and again uh we the commission is
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
aware of this bill but we did not really
 
03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it in depth and as I mentioned
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
before that is one of our um
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh purposes to propose and vet uh
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislation which I think would help
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
answer in the future some of the
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
questions that you you know this this is
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
a great team you've asked wonderful
 
03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions you pay attention um and it's
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
a privilege to have an opportunity to

speak before this committee um but I
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
think we could help save you some time
 
03:16:09.189 --> 03:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the future on ATV legislation if we
 
03:16:13.189 --> 03:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
got a chance to uh vet it first and
 
03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
finally just to speak on behalf of the
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
commission um we are a talented Bunch um
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
I represent landowners so I do but I use
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
an ATV so I'm not completely anti ATV
 
03:16:27.070 --> 03:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
but I
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:17:11.110 --> 03:17:11.120 align:start position:0%

bill we are in support I olizee for that
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
confusion I will endeavor to do better
 
03:17:22.269 --> 03:17:22.279 align:start position:0%

03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:17:27.269 --> 03:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh The Fishing Game
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
Commission is in support uh of this uh
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh the reason being is that
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh Nova and uh came to us and about this
 
03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill and and I too at first looked at it
 
03:17:41.110 --> 03:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
and said well increase in weight what
 
03:17:43.630 --> 03:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
what does that mean um and then I looked
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
at really what the gross weight of a
 
03:17:47.309 --> 03:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
Jeep Wrangler is off the lot and it's
 
03:17:51.550 --> 03:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
about 5,300 um pounds and this would not
 
03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
bring that that you know the 3500 would
 
03:17:55.070 --> 03:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
not bring it to that level wouldn't
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
allow Jeeps or anything else um the
 
03:17:59.070 --> 03:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
other part of it is as well is that as
 
03:18:02.349 --> 03:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
you increase uh weight you're going you
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
know we're restricted to that 65 in in
 
03:18:07.870 --> 03:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
width and manufacturers just can't make
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
a machine that's uh that's heavier and
 
03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
not make it wider so really we are
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
protected by that width um going forward
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and um so therefore that's why we would
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
we would support it thank you any
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
03:18:27.189 --> 03:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
cap seeing none thank you C thanks so
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%

bill um and uh wanted to First give you
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit of uh background on who we
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
are um our
 
03:19:41.229 --> 03:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
organization represents Timberland
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
owners in the state's Forest products
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
industry our Members Own or manage over
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
a million acres of land in the state of
 
03:19:48.560 --> 03:19:49.269 align:start position:0%
a million acres of land in the state of
New

03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:19:51.469 --> 03:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of that land is open
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
to Recreation um whether it's it's
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
pedestrian use or in in many instances
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
Trail use you heard earlier today that
 
03:20:07.189 --> 03:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
um that I think the number was 80% of
 
03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
the trails in the state um are on
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
private land so we're a big stakeholder
 
03:20:17.229 --> 03:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
in ohrv use and Trail use across the
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
state and we we have a good relationship
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the state agencies that regulate
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and monitor this um and and for the
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
with the local clubs as well there's a a
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
good Cooperative relationship in in
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
almost all
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
instances um for a forest land owner you
 
03:20:38.279 --> 03:20:39.150 align:start position:0%
instances um for a forest land owner you
you

03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
own 100 acres even 50 acres the value of
 
03:20:46.990 --> 03:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
that Timber is dictated in large part by
 
03:20:51.030 --> 03:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
access if I can't get to my wood cut it
 
03:20:54.269 --> 03:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
and get it to Market its value is is
 
03:20:57.630 --> 03:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
greatly diminished so what so anything
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
that affects or has the potential to
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
affect my ability to access that Timber
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about roads skid Trails
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
log Landings if anything impacts that it
 
03:21:10.790 --> 03:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
it actually has a dollar effect on my
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
bottom line um if I have a piece of land
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's on a class six road on the
 
03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
backside of a class six road that has
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
been that has been weathered and used
 
03:21:25.229 --> 03:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
and is impassible for my logging truck
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
for me to access my Timber and get that
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
to Market I have to put a significant
 
03:21:32.910 --> 03:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
investment into that road and that
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me affects my bottom
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
line um when I brought this bill before
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
our policy committee I just want you to
 
03:21:43.229 --> 03:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of the context that we
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
look at these bills bills like this the
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
land owners and and two of them are
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
large land owners from Coos County
 
03:21:53.309 --> 03:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
they're private land owners they own
 
03:21:57.229 --> 03:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of acres and their
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
their eyes kind of bugged out and they
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
said you know right now oh and they
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
support ohrv use they support it on
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
their on their property they have
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
easements or right of ways um which are
 
03:22:12.510 --> 03:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
updated annually or every five years
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Trails Bureau they
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
support the sport they recognize it's an
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
important economic engine but they also
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that's a there's a financial
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's a financial downside if that
 
03:22:27.309 --> 03:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
road gets degraded if that road really
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
starts to fall apart and recognize these
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
are not highly engineered roads um in
 
03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
some instances we're talking about skid
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
trails that have over time been kind of
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
developed and graded and and cultivated
 
03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
into a trail so we're not talking about
 
03:22:46.510 --> 03:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
an interstate or a a road where you have
 
03:22:50.349 --> 03:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
lifts of of gravel and and uh fabric uh
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
erosion fabric underneath it many times
 
03:22:55.389 --> 03:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
these are skid Trails or Hall Roads that
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
have been kind of developed over time
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
and so they they looked at the bill and
 
03:23:02.950 --> 03:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
they said you know right now our roads
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
are taking a beating as it is um we have
 
03:23:08.670 --> 03:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
instances and it's and it gone are the
 
03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
days I should say of the bad apples we
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
could always point to well there was
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
that bad apple he went out or she went
 
03:23:17.550 --> 03:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
out they should have been out there in
 
03:23:19.710 --> 03:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
in March when the ground was wet they
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
said that's yeah you get some of that
 
03:23:24.269 --> 03:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
but the volume of traffic on some of
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
these roads has gotten so large that
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
roads um one of the L one of the
 
03:23:33.389 --> 03:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
Foresters said he said you know my my
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
roads are starting to look like creek
 
03:23:38.710 --> 03:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
beds or stream beds because the fines as
 
03:23:42.189 --> 03:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
these machines go over it you get dust
 
03:23:44.550 --> 03:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the dust are your fines and that's
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
what knits your Stones together you get
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
those dust that blow off and they said
 
03:23:51.189 --> 03:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know we manage it we recognize these
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
are important but these are some of the
 
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
impacts that we see and particularly on
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
private land that's a cost to me as a
 
03:24:01.189 --> 03:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
land owner to maintain that road and
 
03:24:03.790 --> 03:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
maintain my access to do the management
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the timber
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
harvesting and and so that's that's the
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
point those were some of the comments
 
03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
that I got from
 
03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
them although this is specific to State
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
state-owned Property
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
or state-owned Trails there are some
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns you heard
 
03:24:24.269 --> 03:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
already today about the connection
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
connecting Trails Perry stream was
 
03:24:27.790 --> 03:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
times um so there are connectors that
 
03:24:34.110 --> 03:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
aren't state-owned we also heard couple
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
that with the fact that we heard that
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't really enforced or
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
enforceable um absence say a sticker as
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Veil had suggested it's
 
03:24:45.910 --> 03:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult to enforce this um
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
fishing game doesn't carry around a set
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
of scales like our friends at the
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety when they stop our
 
03:24:52.590 --> 03:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
logging trucks and weigh them along the
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
side of the road they don't carry scales
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
along so you have you have a situation
 
03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
where I could be riding along at on a
 
03:25:03.790 --> 03:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
state state-owned Trail I need to I want
 
03:25:08.349 --> 03:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
to go to point B I'm going to cross over
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're out in the woods without a lot of
 
03:25:13.229 --> 03:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
signage it's very many times very
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to know that you have you have
 
03:25:17.710 --> 03:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
wandered on to private property it's a
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's an accessible Trail and so we heard
 
03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
earlier that with the Connecticut Lakes
 
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know this issue of confusion about
 
03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
dates we've got a trail here with a date
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
closing date and another Trail let's
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
take that and apply it to weight limits
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
I've got a trail here that says 2100 lbs
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
um oh now I've got a trail that says I
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
can go up to 3500 lbs you get the same
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
confusion concerns and same confusion
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
issues that you could see with that with
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
that closing date that we you you folks
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
on I guess the the other the other piece
 
03:26:01.710 --> 03:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
is you know this there's the spillover
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
piece with respect to State ownership um
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know you talk to a real estate
 
03:26:09.189 --> 03:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
attorney and I know there are a few
 
03:26:12.070 --> 03:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys probably in the room what is
 
03:26:14.349 --> 03:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
ownership if I have a right of way
 
03:26:16.750 --> 03:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
across my property or an easement across
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
my property that the state of New
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire holds it we we believe that's
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
a ownership interest and therefore does
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
that entitle that trail across private
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
property is that trail now eligible for
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
a 3500 pound weight limit um and I want
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
to point out that we're talking about
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
weights and we're throwing around
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
numbers here you know 3500 3500 lbs is
 
03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
an unladen weight we've all that's where
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's we're Now setting kind of the
 
03:26:52.150 --> 03:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
basement here as we've heard earlier
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
today you add on all the goodies and and
 
03:26:57.550 --> 03:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
forget battery packs but you start
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
adding on some of the other goodies
 
03:27:02.349 --> 03:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
3,500 lbs can certainly become a lot
 
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
more so that's that's something else we
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
want you to to contemplate Rob Johnson
 
03:27:11.070 --> 03:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
does a good job at discussing the quote
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
un what is unladen depending on which
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
section of law or which state you look
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
at unladen can mean different things um
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
and so that's really that's not really
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
defined what is
 
03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
unladen um and lastly I would I would
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
argue just I would give a plug for the
 
03:27:34.590 --> 03:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1180 88 subcommittee in the
 
03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
fact that this it would really have been
 
03:27:38.469 --> 03:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
good to have this vetted a little more
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
thoroughly before that committee for
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
those who have testified or excuse me
 
03:27:44.349 --> 03:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
have been been in this committee for
 
03:27:47.229 --> 03:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
years we can all record call the
 
03:27:51.389 --> 03:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
ohrv kind of turmoil and part of the
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
solution was let's create a sub commit
 
03:27:56.110 --> 03:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
let's create this study committee so
 
03:27:58.110 --> 03:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
that we can Hammer these issues out
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
beforehand try to get some modom of
 
03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
consensus on it before we throw it into
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
the the committee and say here you go
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
here's my idea and now everyone
 
03:28:12.349 --> 03:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
including myself comes out of the
 
03:28:14.110 --> 03:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
woodwork and says whoa whoa wait wait a
 
03:28:15.630 --> 03:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
minute did you think about this did you
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
think about that it would have been much
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
more efficient to have had this some of
 
03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
these discussions and and some of these
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
comments made in that in the context of
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
that study commission um you folks do
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
get you do get paid for your service to
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
the state some would argue not enough um
 
03:28:35.910 --> 03:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
and you know let's make your job easier
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
let's use that study commission for what
 
03:28:42.030 --> 03:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
it was intended for um and so with that
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
I will I will conclude my my testimony
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any question and
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
again um oh the only other thing real
 
03:28:52.349 --> 03:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
quick when we look at weights um there's
 
03:28:55.469 --> 03:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
been a lot of talk about comparing ohvs
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
to SUVs pickup trucks Tacomas pick your
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
pick your favorite
 
03:29:03.309 --> 03:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle I think the thing that the ball
 
03:29:05.309 --> 03:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
that we've got to keep our eye on is
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about comparing 3500
 
03:29:12.030 --> 03:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
lbs to my Toyota Tacoma we're talking
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
about 3500 lb to what is existing law
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
2000 so to say oh this is all right
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
because it's not as heavy or as bad as
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that's the
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to think about this it
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier we're talking
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
about a 75% increase and to increase a
 
03:29:34.590 --> 03:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
weight limit just because there isn't an
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
easy way to com to ensure compliance is
 
03:29:40.510 --> 03:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
probably not the best reason to increase
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
a weight limit let's work on getting
 
03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
these let's get a handle on the enforce
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
M piece and then figure out what's
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
really going on before we start
 
03:29:52.750 --> 03:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
increasing weight limits so that we can
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
say all right now we feel good we're in
 
03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
compliance because it's
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
3500b let's we set we set a weight limit
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
at 2100 for a reason let's let's enforce
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this time I will conclude my
 
03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
comments and I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for your
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
patience any
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
questions one question yes sir Mr than
 
03:30:19.710 --> 03:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm reading down here the your
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
03:30:27.150 --> 03:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh dry un Laden
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
weight specifically some say States in
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
case of electric vehicles the battery is
 
03:30:36.349 --> 03:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
not included now see I'm trying to
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
reason why they want to increase the
 
03:30:42.510 --> 03:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
weight limits now my thought process was
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
okay well they want electric vehicles
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the batteries weigh so much
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
I go that's a great idea because you
 
03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
know it's going to decrease the sound
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
because everybody's complaining you know
 
03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
about the noise but now you're saying
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
that you know it's not going to include
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
the battery weight or is is there some
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
written something written on to confirm
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
that uh sure if if I may chairman um to
 
03:31:10.510 --> 03:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
respond to that question and this was
 
03:31:12.429 --> 03:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
something that Rob Johnson had had dug
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
up with the Farm Bureau this is you're
 
03:31:16.750 --> 03:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
you're really getting at the nub of the
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
issue here is or the Crux of it is that
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
there is not a universal definition and
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
I will talk to Rob and we will he can
 
03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
provide you where it is it is in one
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
definition does not include batteries um
 
03:31:33.070 --> 03:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
there are other def definitions that
 
03:31:36.070 --> 03:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
include you know X you know di Minimus
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
amounts of petroleum and so again it's
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of murky area what is UN
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
ladened and now to kind of put a law
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement person in the seat of trying
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
to enforce something that's not clearly
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
defined just creates conflict and
 
03:31:54.910 --> 03:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
problems I'll talk to Rob and we'll get
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
he can he can dig that
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
up follow up follow
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
up okay can you answer
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
me this I don't
 
03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
know um I'll try
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
objectively why did did they i' say they
 
03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
seeking this weight
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
increase I haven't heard any reasoning
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
why on
 
03:32:22.030 --> 03:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
this otherwise because I said the size
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
isn't getting
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
bigger um so why is there why are they
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
seeking this weight limit increase when
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
everything seems to be hunky dory now I
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
don't that's where I really I'm really
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's the batteries okay that's
 
03:32:40.110 --> 03:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
a great idea but doesn't seem to be that
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
so so I I sat in I sat through the
 
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
testimony you heard before I heard two
 
03:32:48.750 --> 03:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
things I heard one is the battery piece
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
if you get electric you kind of enter
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
this other Universe of weight when it
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
comes because of the batteries in
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
electric but the second piece is is one
 
03:32:59.790 --> 03:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
of compliance there's concern that you
 
03:33:04.510 --> 03:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
have an O A UTV today that's maybe 2100
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
lb you start adding on all the
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
goodies you're out of compliance with
 
03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
that with that weight limit so let's
 
03:33:16.189 --> 03:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
increase the weight limit and now my TV
 
03:33:20.670 --> 03:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
with the goodies is now legal that's the
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's the testimony that I heard today
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
is one of compliance with existing
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
internal combustion two is the electric
 
03:33:30.080 --> 03:33:31.070 align:start position:0%
internal combustion two is the electric
and

03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:33.150 --> 03:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
batteries well then let's just increase
 
03:33:35.070 --> 03:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
it to Laden
 
03:33:38.510 --> 03:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
weight no no anyway thank
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
you other questions for Mr
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
star one
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
more thank you Mr chair um
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you uh correctly you
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
said that there are existing easements
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
um that um members of your Association
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
hold uh are held on properties that your
 
03:33:58.080 --> 03:33:58.990 align:start position:0%
hold uh are held on properties that your
Members

03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
Members
 
03:34:01.950 --> 03:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
Own um it sounds like they don't include
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
weight limits in those easements and so
 
03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
um it's it seems like they're I'm trying
 
03:34:12.269 --> 03:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
to understand what you said are are you
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this is sort of um
 
03:34:19.510 --> 03:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
an intentional taking of by adding on uh
 
03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:21.790 align:start position:0%
an intentional taking of by adding on uh
more

03:34:21.790 --> 03:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
weight so thank you for your question so
 
03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:26.750 align:start position:0%
weight so thank you for your question so
the

03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
easements so I'm I'm a land owner I have
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
20,000 Acres I have a trail that crosses
 
03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
me that's an important trail that the
 
03:34:38.469 --> 03:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Trails Bureau wants to
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
ensure remains open they approach me and
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
say will you grant us an easement to use
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
that strip of land for an ohrv Trail I
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the easements um I don't
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
know to what level of specificity they
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
get into regarding weight limits my my
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
assumption and this is my assumption is
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that they probably just mirror existing
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
law why wouldn't they um but so what I'm
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
saying is in in my point was if I have
 
03:35:15.309 --> 03:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
an easement whether it's granted or sold
 
03:35:18.389 --> 03:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
the state has a real estate interest on
 
03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
that strip of land now they have a legal
 
03:35:23.189 --> 03:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
interest there is a document a legal
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
document that says State of New
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have a legal interest on
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
this strip of land for ohrv use when I
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
go back to the bill that we're dis
 
03:35:35.710 --> 03:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
discussing today it talks about State
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
ownership and state owned trails and so
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
the question that our kind of real
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
estate attorney types are asking is okay
 
03:35:47.309 --> 03:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
if that that's the case Jericho Mountain
 
03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
Park that's easy State owns that fee
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
ownership they own that Lock Stock and
 
03:35:55.150 --> 03:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
Barrel but what about an easement that
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
they own they that's a strip of land on
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know a piece of property they have
 
03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
an ownership interest in it does this
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
apply to that or was that the intention
 
03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
and that's the concern that our our our
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
members had is they said look this is
 
03:36:15.189 --> 03:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
although I don't have state doesn't own
 
03:36:15.199 --> 03:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
although I don't have state doesn't own
the

03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
property um they may have they may be
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
able to claim an ownership interest on
 
03:36:27.189 --> 03:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
this or let's say a a local um ohrv
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast or Club says whoa whoa wait a
 
03:36:31.990 --> 03:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
minute I want to drive my 3500 lound
 
03:36:34.110 --> 03:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle across that piece of private
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
land where the state has an easement on
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
it and state you have an ownership
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
interest your this bill says if it's
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
state-owned I'm going to claim my
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
interest in driving my 3500 lb vehicle
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
across it whether that's a taking or not
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know I guess you know this is this
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
would go into effect these easements get
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
updated once every one to five years um
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
presumably they would mirror that they
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
would reference law and that would be
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps a point of discussion but my
 
03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
point is is that this we talk about
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
where kind of the boundaries that this
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
applies it's not just Jericho and the
 
03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
the other areas that we talk about there
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
are there is a potential implication for
 
03:37:20.590 --> 03:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
private land where the state does have
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.910 --> 03:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
easement representative Sergeant thank
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman could you walk me
 
03:37:31.870 --> 03:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
through that because I'm confused and I
 
03:37:34.030 --> 03:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
think I might be reading this wrong then
 
03:37:35.710 --> 03:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh the language of the statute I thought
 
03:37:41.469 --> 03:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
it was um on state-owned Trails the 50
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
Ines th000 pounds applies except for
 
03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:48.429 align:start position:0%
Ines th000 pounds applies except for
Jericho

03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
Jericho
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
Mountain I thought it was just limited
 
03:37:50.239 --> 03:37:51.910 align:start position:0%
Mountain I thought it was just limited
to

03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
Jericho no no let me let me let me let
 
03:38:06.229 --> 03:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.349 --> 03:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
statute it's Jericho
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
Mountain it also talks about um there's
 
03:38:19.110 --> 03:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
also this definition also applies to
 
03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
trails in Coos County state owned trails
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
in Coos County um I don't have a copy of
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
the statute itself so it's my my read of
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
it and I I could be wrong but it was
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
also a a application of
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
this on Jericho Mountain as well or
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me um state-owned trails in Coos
 
03:38:44.590 --> 03:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
County and then the other I think there
 
03:38:46.830 --> 03:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
was reference to to amonk and there were
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
some other trails that were referenced
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
where there's state state
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
ownership again nevertheless the the
 
03:38:57.790 --> 03:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
concern the spillover concern is I
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
someone comes up for the weekend rides
 
03:39:03.790 --> 03:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
their 3500 pound ohrv on Jericho
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
mountain and says all right Saturday
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of fun where do you want
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
to go today kids let's go for a
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
ride north um up towards uh you know up
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
up towards arrol on these state state
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
Trails they have a right of way State
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
trail again without this enforcement
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
even if it is just Jericho Mountain
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
who's going to say wait night you can
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.510 --> 03:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
Mountain thank you Mr star thank you
 
03:39:46.990 --> 03:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
speaking

03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
against you know the disadvantage and
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
coming up towards the end is everybody
 
03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
gets to steal your thunder before you
 
03:39:57.720 --> 03:39:58.830 align:start position:0%
gets to steal your thunder before you
sit

03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
sit
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
down so um for the bulk of my career I
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
have built roads and bridges uh of many
 
03:40:10.990 --> 03:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
sorts State Bridges rotaries so I have a
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
fairly good command of uh Road design
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
and Bridge design also a lifetime ago I
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
was a young architecture student who had
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
to sit through Statics and strength
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
materials steel Design One steel design
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
two concrete one concrete 2 and
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
indeterminate structures I'm not going
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to try to get too Nerdy with you today
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
cuz uh it's not my intent but um I do
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
have a very serious concern uh about
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
bridges um you know we've been assured
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
that they go over our bridges or the
 
03:40:47.469 --> 03:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
their I should say with maintenance
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
equipment and grooming equipment if it's
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
shared with sow machines that's all well
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
and good but a tractor pulling a groomer
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
is probably 30 feet long so at any point
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
if it's going over a 12T Bridge only a
 
03:41:04.830 --> 03:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
very small portion of its entire weight
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
is uh is on that bridge same if it's a
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
pickup truck or whatever you know the
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
wheelbase is such that the front wheels
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
are off the bridge before the back
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
wheels come on but when you're talking a
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle um that um has a five less than
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
a 5ft wheelbase you can you can have
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
three of those on one bridge and if
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
you've increased the dead weight to 3500
 
03:41:31.389 --> 03:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
by the time you fuel it oil it at a
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
spear tire and any other conveniences
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
and put six fat jolly men like me in the
 
03:41:39.630 --> 03:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
top of that thing you're well over 6,000
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
lb I weigh 300 lb put six of me on top
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
of one of those vehicles and imagine
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
what what that does to a small bridge
 
03:41:49.469 --> 03:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
that has not been raided by any
 
03:41:53.070 --> 03:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
engineering agency or any dot engineer
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
and so um as a uh snow machiner I had
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
been over many of those bridges and sort
 
03:42:00.990 --> 03:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
of held my breath and prayed while I
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
went across and my snow machine weighed
 
03:42:05.229 --> 03:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
considerably less than what we're
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
talking about now my my Hyundai weighs
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
less than uh 3500 lb and uh so uh my
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hyundai also have much larger tires it
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
has dis brakes so think about the
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
Dynamics you're adding up to uh six Kips
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
on on on this on this piece of Machinery
 
03:42:29.790 --> 03:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're um presumably not changing the
 
03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
wheelbase or the width so what happens
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
Dynamics you want to be going 35 miles
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
an hour with Five Guys Like Me on a
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
little vehicle that's got less than four
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
feet of stance um center of gravity on
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
that thing is going to perform entirely
 
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
different than the 2100 uh pound machine
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about so we've got
 
03:42:52.110 --> 03:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
something that's going to perform
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
entirely differently um being rented out
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
to people with absolutely no experience
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um there is a certainly a
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
potential uh for some uh serious
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
disasters with that scenario but that's
 
03:43:09.070 --> 03:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
again an entirely different subject back
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
to Bridges um um I'm thinking that the
 
03:43:16.229 --> 03:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
intelligent approach to I'm not saying
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't increase machines I love
 
03:43:22.590 --> 03:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
the idea of of of battery uh Laden um um
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
equipment I love the idea of the
 
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
industry uh moving over to fourstroke
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
engines which are inherently much
 
03:43:34.110 --> 03:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
heavier but much quieter so I I'm not
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
saying we should close the door on any
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
of this kind of progress but I'm also
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that the immediate the now
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of it if they want to make bigger
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
machines oh that's another thing too if
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're if you're taking a 2100 lb
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
machine and making it weigh 6,000 lb
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
when you look at uh speaking again to
 
03:43:56.910 --> 03:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
what was previous said when you look at
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
the change in ground pressure it's
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
enormous um um there's a whole body of
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
science called rotational physics or
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
rotational Dynamics but if you have a
 
03:44:09.389 --> 03:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
wheel that's about this big the amount
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
of surface area that all the weight is
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
bearing on is uh is relatively small
 
03:44:18.030 --> 03:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
compared to my uh my Hyundai which has a
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
wheel that's about this big and has a
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
much greater surface area so yes they
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
are working on Tire design they're
 
03:44:26.830 --> 03:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
putting less pressure in the tires to
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
flatten it out a little bit but we there
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
is still a potential uh for some serious
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
damage to uh to roads in my opinion and
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
if this was a do uh project um I would
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
be I would be bounced to very specific
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
gravels and compaction levels and
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
building a road that would essentially
 
03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
be capable of taking um the uh the
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
pressures being generated but we're
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're on back roads in some cases not
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
even roads and so the potential there is
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
is terrific and again back to the
 
03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
bridges uh you know you get five or six
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
people at Stop on a 20 foot bridge and
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're running at uh
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know 5,000 6,000 there is a
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
potential there uh that should be
 
03:45:18.149 --> 03:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
identified uh the US Forest Service with
 
03:45:20.349 --> 03:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
all their back roads for instance has a
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
posting uh class one class two class
 
03:45:24.750 --> 03:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
three Bridges and often time they tell
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
you what the weight limits are uh so the
 
03:45:30.030 --> 03:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
forest service certainly recognizes um
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
the potential for um uh for some kind of
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
mishap and I I'm not against moving
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
forward but I think there needs to be a
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
good deal more thought put into uh the
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
inertia of these machines you know they
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
were ility to tip over very easily how
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
long is it going to take them to stop
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
with this extra momentum this extra iner
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
are they be going to put much larger
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
disc brakes on maybe that's part of the
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
reason why they're asking for uh an
 
03:46:01.229 --> 03:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
increase in weight basically is they
 
03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
want to put a lot more horsepower which
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
weighs more and then of course you need
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more stopping power which weighs
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
more that's my thought that's just an
 
03:46:12.429 --> 03:46:12.439 align:start position:0%
opinion I can't offer that as testimony
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that as fact but that is in
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
fact my my answer to your question about
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sorry why do they want
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
to do this so anyway I I could go on a
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
lot more nerdier about rolling loads
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
static loads Dynamic loads but you would
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
all fall asleep I hopefully have made my
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
point that this needs a lot more thought

boating season started on Memorial Day
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and ended on Labor Day however changes
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
have occurred to our New Hampshire

kayaking caning and Rowing sculls all

three activities allows participants to

explore our Waters and experience the

connection with New Hampshire's nature
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
however associated with these activities
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
can be a significant risk that is not
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
realized by many participants
 
03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
while kayaking canoeing and roaring in

the scull during late fall and early
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
spring and cold water can be a rewarding
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
experience it does pose significant
 
03:49:55.830 --> 03:49:55.840 align:start position:0%

03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
in New
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've all experienced
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
occasional warmer days in both late fall
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
and early spring these days often give
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
false Impressions that water
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
temperatures are as warm as the year
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
temperatures but in fact they maintain a
 
03:50:14.189 --> 03:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
dangerously cold temperature during late
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
fall in early spring strong winds make
 
03:50:18.189 --> 03:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
the padding of these type of boats more
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
challenging and can increase the risk of
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
capsizing or falling
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
overboard when you capsize or fall
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
overboard you can experience a
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
scientific term called cold water
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
immersion cold water immersion is a

sudden unexpected fall into cold water
 
03:50:35.710 --> 03:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
which causes you to involuntary gas
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
water in justest water which can lead to
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
drowning and ultimately death another
 
03:50:42.550 --> 03:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
danger that participants facing falling
 
03:50:44.670 --> 03:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
into cold water is hypothermia
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
hypothermia recurs when your body core
 
03:50:49.149 --> 03:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
temperature drops to a dangerously low
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
level symptoms include intense shivering

slur speech confusion unconsciousness
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
and eventually death wearing a personal
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
flotation vipes would not totally
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
prevent hypothermia hypothermia but it
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
will certainly prevent the quickest
 
03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
onset of it and save your life the
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
participants Who falls into cold water
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
will not be kicking their feet and
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
moving their arms to try to keep
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%

03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%

03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire go 237 years
 
03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
without a proposed Bill like
 
03:54:09.790 --> 03:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
this why personal responsibility it's up
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
to each of us to take care of ourselves
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
to keep ourselves safe when we go into
 
03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
the waters and you do boating
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
activities now the issue
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
of this is definitely a shell wear so
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're definitely talking threats of even
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
though I don't see any penalties in this
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure it's going to go uh it
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
would go to Ru making and then there
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
would be fines threats of fines and
 
03:54:40.149 --> 03:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement and
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it's so we're then we're
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
talking you know clearly uh you know to
 
03:54:47.389 --> 03:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
take the fun out of boating when you've
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
got you got to worry you know you're
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
wearing the the uh life jacket this
 
03:54:54.750 --> 03:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
whole in enforcement thing so the basic
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
question comes down to is it is it the
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
proper role of government to take care
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
of uh the residents to keep us safe or
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
is it our own uh personal responsibility
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
to keep ourselves safe when we go about
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
and uh you know do Recreation or or
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the state or us and I say it
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
should be up to the individuals the
 
03:55:23.189 --> 03:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
residents to determine they know their
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
level of skill when they go and do
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
boating they can check the temperature
 
03:55:29.309 --> 03:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
of the water can check the weather
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
conditions also the size of the body of
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
water that they're going into and the
 
03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
speed and they can decide do I they need
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
to wear the is it worth it or not
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're not a baby um and so I think
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point is who's resp
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for keeping us safe us or or
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
the state and I say it's us and that
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill actually goes against the New
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Live Free or Die uh spirit
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically Nanny State and
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons I oppose the belt
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
freeden seeing none thank you for your
 
03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
testimony and the last pink card uh
 
03:56:23.189 --> 03:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman honorable
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh it's good to
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
see you uh familiar faces and and those
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
new faces uh your committee is one that
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol visits often and uh I look
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing you on a regular basis
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh I come to you today uh my name is Tim
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
Dunley and I'm the retired Captain uh of
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol unit and currently
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
employed as a program specialist and a
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the Marine
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
Patrol I come to you today in support of
 
03:56:54.910 --> 03:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
this bill uh as here in New Hampshire we
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
recognize uh that our statistics for
 
03:56:59.229 --> 03:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
freshwater drownings particularly as
 
03:57:01.590 --> 03:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
they relate to uh paddlecraft in our
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
state reflect the statistics that we see
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
Nationwide in that over 80
 
03:57:13.630 --> 03:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
3% of the people who drowned as a result
 
03:57:15.870 --> 03:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
of a boat accident meaning the boat was
 
03:57:17.550 --> 03:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
initially the platform for their
 
03:57:21.389 --> 03:57:21.399 align:start position:0%
activity over 83% of those folks were
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
not wearing life jackets and in fact
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
that 83% applies to these types of craft
 
03:57:28.560 --> 03:57:30.269 align:start position:0%
that 83% applies to these types of craft
specifically

03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:57:33.550 --> 03:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
paddlecraft over 78% were not wearing
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
life jackets when they
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
passed uh hold water immersion as
 
03:57:42.030 --> 03:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald mentioned is a
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that most people who who uh
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
are ignorant and that's not a negative
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
connotation who are ignorant to boating
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
and paddling they can go to a big box
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
store for $150 walk away with a kayak or
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
standup paddle board and not have any
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the dangers that exist they
 
03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
are not required to take boating
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
education courses like our power boers
 
03:58:07.870 --> 03:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
and so they they strike out on the water
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
and when that water starts dropping
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
below temperatures of 50° and
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
colder it is amazing how quickly and
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
they don't know how quickly Mother
 
03:58:19.349 --> 03:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
Nature will take away the use of their
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
arms and their legs it's the it is the
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh rapid onset of hypothermia in that
 
03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
cold water that takes those necessary
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
bodily functions away from
 
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
self-rescue and so often I have seen
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
over over the years in my career where
 
03:58:38.080 --> 03:58:38.950 align:start position:0%
over over the years in my career where
First

03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
First
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
Responders are within sight of victims
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
who have fallen through the ice or have
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
capsized in a paddlecraft before the ice
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
comes into our Waters and and they just
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to keep
 
03:58:53.710 --> 03:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
themselves on the surface where with a
 
03:58:56.269 --> 03:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
life jacket not a bulky one I have
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
examples of life jackets now technology
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
makes it comfortable they're not
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
intrusive and will allow that person to
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
remain on the surface whether they're
 
03:59:06.910 --> 03:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
suffering from hypothermia or not that
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
much longer for First Responders to get
 
03:59:12.750 --> 03:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
to them uh it's as a result of this and
 
03:59:15.070 --> 03:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
and looking at the scientific facts that
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
exist with with how many people we can
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
save and I know particularly the last
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
few years in our state it's been the
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
concern of the legislature it's been the
 
03:59:26.349 --> 03:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
concern of the governor's office and the
 
03:59:27.790 --> 03:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety with the number of
 
03:59:29.469 --> 03:59:29.479 align:start position:0%
drownings that we are
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
experiencing and so often many of them
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
are during that cold water season thus
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
the dates that have been presented in
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
this bill from representative McDonald
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
before you and I encourage you to uh
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
support it I'm happy to answer an ENT
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
any questions you may
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
have yes representative Brun Bridal
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
taking my uh question uh was the New
 
03:59:56.670 --> 03:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol consulted in the
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
um when this when this bill was first
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
drafted like the the Inception of this
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
Bill yes we were yes sir uh follow if
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
you don't mind um I represent Hampton we
 
04:00:11.229 --> 04:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of paddle boarding standup
 
04:00:12.910 --> 04:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
paddle boarding in the marsh I noticed
 
04:00:16.630 --> 04:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
that that um specific activity is
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
omitted from this uh version of this
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is this a piece of
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation if past you intend on
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
following up on in the future to include
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe other paddle Sports to to more
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
clearly Define that would be included in
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
this I think it's safe to say that that
 
04:00:35.309 --> 04:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol and the department of
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
safety uh would be open to any uh
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
changes or advancements in making sure
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
that people on our waterways are safe uh
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
if if representative McDonald saw this
 
04:00:48.070 --> 04:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a first attempt to bring
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
awareness to what is happening in other
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
states with seasonal life jacket wear um
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
certainly we would be behind any safety
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
measure that is just going to keep uh
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
people on the water alive it's it's
 
04:01:02.110 --> 04:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
important to to realize and I know i'
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
I've had some people in the hallway say
 
04:01:05.710 --> 04:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
well it's you know motorcycle helmet
 
04:01:08.830 --> 04:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
seat seat belts the surface of the water
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
is such an unforgiving environment you
 
04:01:13.510 --> 04:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
can become involved in an automobile
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
accident and if you're injured and
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
thrown from the vehicle You're On Solid
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
Ground on a boat you're not and uh the
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
the water is just so unforgiving and and
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
people are just so unsuspecting uh when
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
situations representative
 
04:01:35.070 --> 04:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:01:39.149 --> 04:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
Captain for taking my um my question um
 
04:01:42.030 --> 04:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at those flotation devices
 
04:01:43.950 --> 04:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
you have there and they look extremely
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable and they perhaps wouldn't
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
interfere with paddle Sports in any way
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
could you tell me how both of them work
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
particularly the smaller one that looks
 
04:01:52.479 --> 04:01:54.030 align:start position:0%
particularly the smaller one that looks
extremely

04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
04:01:56.149 --> 04:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable thank you very much for your
 
04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
question yes I'd be happy to this is
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
essentially a fanny pack that one would
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
wear around their waist um you will see
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
on the front of it it has a yellow tab
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
it is equipped with a small CO2 air
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
cartridge inside here you simply uh pull
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
this cord
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
it inflates into the typical horseshoes
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
type design that most life people are
 
04:02:20.349 --> 04:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with when they think of a life
 
04:02:22.750 --> 04:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
jacket it is inflated in front of your
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
chest you simply put your head around it
 
04:02:26.670 --> 04:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a plastic Buckle that you
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
you you snap across your chest it has a
 
04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
little air valve on the side so you can
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
regulate the inflation um if the the
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
warm sun and the summer is beating on it
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
you can let a little air out or you can
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
fill it up uh and and that's all there
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
is to it uh this type of device is again
 
04:02:48.269 --> 04:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
an inflatable it's more of a suspender
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
style that you would wear around your
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
neck um Buckle it in the front you pull
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
the tab it's already around your neck it
 
04:03:00.990 --> 04:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
inflates up uh into a uh um a bright
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
material and if you've encountered a
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
marine patrol officer on patrol by
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
Department policy we are required when
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
we are underway on the boat
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
to wear these at all times to set the
 
04:03:19.389 --> 04:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
example for the public and this just
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
inflates around your
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
neck um and will keep you at the surface
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh it comes with an emergency whistle to
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
bring attention to people if uh if
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're out alone again the air valve to
 
04:03:33.389 --> 04:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
be able to regulate the pressure um when
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're through with it you simply
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
deflate it fold it back up put a new CO2
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
cartridge in it which is about $12 and
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
