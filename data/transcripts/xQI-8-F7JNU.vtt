i think we're all set um with that
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tell you briefly the uh the
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
process that we're going to
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
um operate under here we have
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
two senate bills uh omnibus bills today
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 and senate bill 142
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
fn um my plan for today
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
is to introduce
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
um each part
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
individually and let the
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
sponsoring senator speak to their bill
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
and run through all parts of senate bill
 
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.229 align:start position:0%
and run through all parts of senate bill
100.

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
100.
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
um that's a little glitch to that we're
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to actually start with part four
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to start with part
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
one and the reason for that is a
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
scheduling problem
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
with one of the people testifying for
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
part four
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
um at some point early on here i have to
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
step out for a few minutes for a
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh commitment um to my constituents back
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
in franklin
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
um but i will hand things over to uh
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
vice chair green for for the hearings
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
and things will proceed
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
with that um i think unless there's any
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
comments or concerns or questions how
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
we'll go through we'll introduce each
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
have each sponsoring senator speak and
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
then go back
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
to each section and and call on everyone
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
as they have signed up
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
and by part number so right back to part
 
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
and by part number so right back to part
one

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
part two part three when we get to
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
the general public any
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
problems concerns anyone here no one
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
with the committee that i see
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
hands up um with that
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
um i would like to call uh senator
 
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
um i would like to call uh senator

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
charities are selected to
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
be involved in all of that i was on a i
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
was on a commission
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
about six seven years ago which we we
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
did something similar
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we felt it was time to do it again
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
so uh just so you understand that there
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
was two
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
two bills there was one in the house and
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
one in the senate
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
the house bill was identical to the
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill with
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
except for reception of one one
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
component which i'll talk about in a
 
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.749 align:start position:0%
component which i'll talk about in a
second

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
the house bill passed out of ways and
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
means unanimous you
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan unanimous was on consent
 
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.189 align:start position:0%
bipartisan unanimous was on consent
calendar

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
the senate voted yes on that and but
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
then put it on the table
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh now we have this this uh section four
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 100 and what i did was i
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to senator d'alessandro
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh to say that can we talk about
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
the difference in the makeup of the
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
committee that's all we're going to be
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
talking about here is the makeup that
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
i said the senate can have whatever they
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
want they want one member from
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
from the ways and means and one member
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
finance committee i brought this issue
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
back to ways and means
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
and ways and means unanimously said we
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
want to increase our number to four
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
and have two members all of the members
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
from ways and means two from the
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
majority party and two from the minority
 
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.310 align:start position:0%
majority party and two from the minority
party

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
which i have discussed that with senator
 
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.310 align:start position:0%
which i have discussed that with senator
d'alessandro

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
he's fine with that so uh
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
i've forwarded uh some amendment
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
language to the chair
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh so we'd like to amend this bill this
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
will probably be the surviving bill
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you so choose as uh your
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
to pass this uh with with the amendment
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh in short that's
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
what this is about again this the
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're talking about
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not only representing myself today
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm representing
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
all of ways and means uh because we did
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
talk about it last week and voted on it
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh that we would support this uh
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 100 part four
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
as amended uh
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was i had difficulty linking
 
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was i had difficulty linking
up

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very very much and uh i i
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
will support everything that
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative obama said
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's about time we look at
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming there's been a
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
proliferation of the quote-unquote
 
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
proliferation of the quote-unquote
casino

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
casino
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
type activities that have taken place
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's become a multi-billion dollar
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
business as
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
as all of us know and uh when senator
 
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
as all of us know and uh when senator
o'dell

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
o'dell
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
chaired a committee a number of years
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
ago uh the the 35
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to the charities uh was put in
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
place and
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
there have been times when that hasn't
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
been arrived at and the charities uh
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
come to us uh repeatedly and ask that
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
amenities be added
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
to charitable gaming in order to
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
increase their portion
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the of the renumeration
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
but i think we need a thorough
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
examination of charitable gaming
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
as as i said it has proliferated
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i think it correctly uh
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative probably but i think we
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
have 16 casinos
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
currently in operation don't we that's
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
the correct number yeah 16.
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
right so i would hope that the committee
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
would would support
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh part four uh with the uh brownie uh
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
amendment which i think is a good one
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
that uh i thank you very much for
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
touching base with me
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to it and i think we'll
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a of a good committee and do a
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
of of this activity that that has become
 
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
of of this activity that that has become
a

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
um it's really become a big part of new
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire and certainly the
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
the charities uh cry out for uh
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the revenues that they need to continue
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
and some incidents that were happening
 
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
and some incidents that were happening
there

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
we had some success that was when the
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the current commissioner of uh health
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh ms shebonet was just taking over at
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
the state hospital
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
and we had some successes and we're
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
trying to now
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
look at some of the other hospitals
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
and right now because of covid
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the isolation and other things um
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
there are those that believe that the
 
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.829 align:start position:0%
there are those that believe that the
incidences

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
incidences
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
of violence and workplace safety
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at now
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
and uh we actually introduced this bill
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh at the request of the hospitals and
 
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
uh at the request of the hospitals and
uh

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
as many of them did to die to covet
 
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
as many of them did to die to covet
death

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
and we believe it's
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
a commission that needs to happen and we
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray are there any
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
i have a question a question from
 
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
i have a question a question from
representative

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
william is this microphone on press the
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
red button
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
i did press the red button i can i can
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
huh you can hear me okay thank you for
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
um the question i have about the
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals and workplace safety
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh i know all the hospitals have
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
protocols for workplace safety
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
are they looking for root causes
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
of incidents or are they just trying to
 
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.269 align:start position:0%
of incidents or are they just trying to
overhaul

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
overhaul
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
their policies and protocols with regard
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
to workplace safety
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much up to the commission
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
where this thing
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately goes uh but
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
right now there are are those that don't
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
the uh rules that we have in place right
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
now are adequate
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
um there was a uh a a
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
zoom session that was held by uh senator
 
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
zoom session that was held by uh senator
sherman

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and some of the doctors testified
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
um and their solution
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
more involved in patients
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
for patients that present themselves at
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
a hospital
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i particularly don't believe that
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
that is the solution
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
so we need to get the best minds in new
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire together
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
on this issue and chart a path forward
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that all those healthcare
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
workers are taught about de-escalation
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
techniques which is one of the things
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we used
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
at the state hospital which appeared to
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
work very well there
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
so again a representative
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
exactly where this commission is going
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
to go uh i can't tell you right now
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
but uh there are people on there that
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
will be smarter than i about this
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
seeing any okay
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony sir uh next
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh senator haybard to speak first this
 
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
uh senator haybard to speak first this
morning

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh for part three among others yes
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm i'm here uh just on behalf
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
of senator ward
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
who is the prime sponsor of this and she
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it so i'm basically just
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to introduce it as uh
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
part three and it's a commission uh to
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
differentiate the cost of education
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
and the cost of care for children in a
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
residential facility
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
and again it's sponsored by by senator
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
ward and uh
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's about as much as i can offer at
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
well i guess i do have a question okay
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
um and i know you don't have a whole lot
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
of information but
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
um my question on this is
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
we already know what the cost of
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
residential care is
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
and it it seemed to me that it would not
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
be too difficult although i may totally
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
be wrong
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the cost of education
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
over and above the cost of
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
um providing a safe place
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
um with the residential setting
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i when i read this i thought geez it
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
would seem like it's pretty easy
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
tell me where i'm wrong on that i i
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't tell you either way
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh because i'm really not super familiar
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
with this part of it i'm just
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
here just to present on on behalf of
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
senator ward who couldn't make it
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
at this time uh it's basically a
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
check out the different uh the
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
differential cost of education
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
for the care of children residential
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
facilities that's that's about as far as
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
i can
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
go with this update thank you i
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the questions and uh and i
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
think they're good
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's a good question thank you yeah
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i believe that grant bossie
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
is also here to
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
to speak to on behalf of the ward if you
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
would please elevate him the panelists
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes do you see him yet he's on his way
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
my name is grant bosse i'm the majority
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
policy director for the new hampshire
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
senate senator ward asked me to be
 
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.230 align:start position:0%
senate senator ward asked me to be
around

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
mostly to write down any questions you
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
have so that she could answer them for
 
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0%
have so that she could answer them for
you

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
two school districts approach her uh
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
before the bill filing
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
period and talked to her about disabled
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
children with residential placements now
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
there are several ways we differentiate
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
state adequate education aid based on
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the different needs of children
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
including special ed but residential
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
care is not part of that differentiation
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
formula so the
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
this bill this commission uh wouldn't
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily study what those costs are
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
but how those costs should if at all
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
be included in the adequacy formula
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether this is a
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
different category of differentiated aid
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to some
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
other program that we might do outside
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the adequate education formula
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh one district had a child with a
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty thousand dollars
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh in residential expenses another
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh and especially for smaller school
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
districts this can mean
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
a huge hit to the budget and a huge
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
impact on local property taxpayers
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you get one or two kids with really
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing expenses
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh spread over a very small local
 
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh spread over a very small local
district

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
so uh senator ward thought that
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
deciding whether this might be
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate for differentiated aid under
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
was something that would require a
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more in-depth
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
study and thought that a study committee
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
would be the proper vehicle to do so
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
and she appreciates uh your
 
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:05.669 align:start position:0%
and she appreciates uh your
consideration

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions i do have a question
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
i seem to be the question gail today
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's right um
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation you know
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
when i was thinking residential setting
 
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
when i was thinking residential setting
i'm

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
thinking more of facility rather than a
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
home residential setting so
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um it seems to me and
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not an
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
education guru and and
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
and defer to those that are um but it
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
children that require special education
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
have been provided with some
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
additional adequacy for that specific
 
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
additional adequacy for that specific
category

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and how does that
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
adequacy differ when someone goes into a
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
residential setting because
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
i would think the residential setting
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh care other than education per se
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then education as um
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
directed by the local community that is
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
that child's care so how
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
how again are we trying to figure out
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
what that is if we already have a
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
formula and i assume we do
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
in place for folks that that need it for
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
a specific education
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative well the
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
current formula doesn't differentiate
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
between the level of care that these
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh special needs students get uh it's an
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
extra bump
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
in your district's formula but that's
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
whether that that
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into account um the
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
services that they can really run up the
 
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.750 align:start position:0%
services that they can really run up the
tab

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
tab
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
so you get the same amount as a student
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
that is simply receiving
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh extra attention from uh somebody in
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
the classroom from somebody like my aunt
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
who was
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
for many years special education
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
provider in local public schools
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
um so this would this would look at
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
which of these costs uh much of much of
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
them are outside the classroom
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
are appropriate for state education aid
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
and which uh maybe should be picked up
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
through some other
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
hhs some other agency it would really
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
look into
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
not only the total money spent where
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
that money should be coming from
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
between the state between which agencies
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the state or
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
whether it should come from local
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions seeing
 
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions seeing
none

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and next week i'll try to
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
bring up uh
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
hello i can you hear me yes i can
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm speaking on part two
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
is this is this time you want you're
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
you're aren't you talking about part
 
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
you're aren't you talking about part
three

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
well what i'm doing now is i'm
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of moving down the list
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
of the order just from top to bottom
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's all right okay
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay if you're ready for part two of
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm i'm fine i just wanted to say
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
you might we might be hopping around a
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
little bit but let's
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
let's proceed in that way thank you mr
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair this is
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes it might it might be helpful if i
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually introduce part two
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
before you take ms bearden oh if you
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
would sir yes please proceed
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry for the confusion but i
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
go to all the witnesses for each part
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
before we introduce the second one
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh again for the record i am james gray
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
senator from district six
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
and here to introduce the section of the
 
00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
and here to introduce the section of the
bill

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
which deals with payments in lieu of
 
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
which deals with payments in lieu of
taxes

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
by charitable organization this part of
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
the bill was requested by the assessing
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
standards board
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
which has many functions uh as we deal
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
with the taxes
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
right now one of the things that the
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
the assessors have found is
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a a good look at
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
these payments and move taxes
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that is why they've asked for this
 
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.149 align:start position:0%
and that is why they've asked for this
commission

00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh to do that what portion
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
should be taxable uh what portion should
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
not be taxable
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh all issues that
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of money
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
in various municipalities and uh
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
so again they think that this needs a
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
good scrub and they are willing
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
to assist is in doing that and uh you
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
can see the list of uh
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
other people that they've suggested be
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
commission so i would request that you
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
would support
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh this looking
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you sir i apologize for going a
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
little out of order my sheet here
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
does not indicate who some people have
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
indicated what parts of the bill they're
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
speaking on other ones have it so
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
if we skip around a little bit i
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
apologize now if uh one of the things
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
mr chair one of the things that the
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
other some of the other chairmen have
 
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
other some of the other chairmen have
done

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
is that when you get to a part if you
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
ask the participants that are going to
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
speak on that part to raise their hands
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh it probably would make it easier on
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you and the
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
staff that's a great idea thank you sir
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh but let's bring up kathleen reardon

at this time thank you
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%

i am the ceo of the new hampshire center
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is a non-profit organization that
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to strengthening
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
and giving voice to our state's
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector we have
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
more than 700 members that represent the
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
diversity of the nonprofit sector
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
representing all mission types as well
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
as sizes of organizations
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
in the state we are
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill we have some
 
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill we have some
concerns

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
and don't see a specific urgent need to
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with the commission
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
but if the legislators decide to move
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
forward with one we're happy to
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
have a representative on the commission
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
just as way of background as you know
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
law provides for an exemption to
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
religious educational and charitable
 
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.789 align:start position:0%
religious educational and charitable
institutions

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
from taxation of real estate and
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
personal property that are used for
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
mission-related purposes
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
and this exemption is very important to
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits our financial sustainability
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
relies on
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
on this exemption in many cases and
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
you certainly have seen over the last
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
year the critical role that nonprofits
 
00:27:59.039 --> 00:27:59.430 align:start position:0%
year the critical role that nonprofits
play

00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
in aiding the health and well-being of
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
um from non-profit child care
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
organizations um
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
make it it possible for parents to get
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
um that's been really critical health
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
care centers
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
educational institutions all a wide
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
range of
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that are really part of
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
the common good
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
of our communities and essential so we
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
need to do what we can um to make sure
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
that these organizations are sustainable
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
in some cases non-profit organizations
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
voluntarily enter
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
into agreements with municipalities as a
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
effort to address
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
some of the municipal related expenses
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
however even when they do so it's really
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
important to note
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
that this diverts their funding from
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
their charitable mission
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
and many organizations have extremely um
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
tight buzz budgets and often their
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
primary source of funding is donations
 
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
primary source of funding is donations
um

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
so large pilot pilots would divert from
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
the charitable mission
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
so we do urge policymakers to avoid an
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
opening of the floodgate
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
we must be careful to not inadvertently
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
create policies that encourage
 
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
create policies that encourage
municipalities

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
to collect revenue from non-profits
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
that are clearly exempt by law
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
medium-sized smaller
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
organizations would not be able to
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
survive such a burden
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that's very important um we
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
understand that the assessing standards
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
board has an interest in convening this
 
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
board has an interest in convening this
commission

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
again as the state's primary voice of
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofits we don't see an urgent need
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
but we will participate in the
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
commission if the legislature decides to
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with it
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to take any
 
00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:53.029 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to take any
questions

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a question representative
 
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.149 align:start position:0%

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
good background um
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
this this section is dealing with
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
payments in lieu of taxes
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you have an example of what one of
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
i mean like a specific organization that
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
pays them is that what you mean no like
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
what what form these payments in lieu of
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
taxes might be i mean are we talking

about like
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
donating a truck to the city i mean
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
they're usually a cash payment in lieu
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
of taxes
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and they
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a voluntary agreement that
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
organization enters into within
 
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.870 align:start position:0%
organization enters into within

payments and lower taxes to attract
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%

of taxes
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
to attract businesses to new hampshire
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%

uh for these charitable organizations
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
are we planning to
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
allow permanent payments and lower taxes
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
or what do you know
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
i i don't know but i don't think that
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
the the tax incentives to recruit
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are the same
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
as pilots pilots again
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
are non-profits are exempt from paying
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
for for the property that is for
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
charitable uses
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
they may enter into an agreement with
 
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.630 align:start position:0%
they may enter into an agreement with
municipalities

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
to offset some of the municipal
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
costs for things like fire or you know
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
the regular
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
so you know they're not a permanent
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
thing it's something that the
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you i have a
 
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you i have a
question

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
is weird yes yes representative
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
i don't have to push my blue button
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
again i hope i'm all set
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me here yes thank you uh i
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
i really don't know a whole lot about
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
the pilot program so my question is does
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
each municipality
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
or each town have the ability
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
to set um payments in lieu of taxes or
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
have agreements with the different
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations or are they
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
governed by something
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
issued by the state with regard to
 
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.509 align:start position:0%
issued by the state with regard to
percentages

00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the um state law allows for
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
um pilots to take place um
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
and again they are voluntary um so they
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
are negotiations that happen at the
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
at the local level okay and and
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that this
 
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that this
commission

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
would like to look at this to see
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not that should be changed
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
um my unders my understanding is that
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
the commission as
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
senator gray outlined wants to look at
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
what is happening with the pilots as i
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
we want to be sure that any conversation
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
about pilots
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
recognizes the important role that
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits play in our communities and
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't open the floodgates
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
for undue taxation
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
when they're clearly exempt from taxes
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you i see
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
that senator gray has his hand raised
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming he would like to jump in to
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions we've had
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
senator gray if i could mr chairman
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh again um the
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
an organization say a hospital
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
does take services from the community
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
water police fire
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
but it may be better to look like a at a
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
college campus say in durham
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
where a great deal of
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the services of that small town
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
may be dedicated to that tax-exempt
 
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
may be dedicated to that tax-exempt
organization

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
university and this is a way to
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that in some cases these
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
can be a burden and that's the reason
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
for the pilot the reason to look at
 
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.589 align:start position:0%
for the pilot the reason to look at
these

00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that when you get down to the details
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
there can be
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
profit centers or private
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
businesses inside of these organizations
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
that would not be um exempt from taxes
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
if there is a um
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know a lease to a particular piece
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
of land over in durham
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know for uh some commercial
 
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.670 align:start position:0%
you know for uh some commercial
operation

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that part of that should be taxable
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
in some people's opinion uh
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
others so again what we're trying to do
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
is look at the whole issue trying to
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
to seek out fairness between the
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
organizations we are not trying to take
 
00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
organizations we are not trying to take
away

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the tax exemption for any non-profit
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
organization that's working within the
 
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
organization that's working within the
law

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but we are trying to look
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
at those
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
things that are on the fringe to see if
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
being treated adequately and that
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
pilot or the income that they're getting
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
is being done properly so again
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't see you know any hospital
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
any service organization
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
being affected by this other than
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
if they say own a building and they're
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
renting that building for a commercial
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
operation to happen
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
and then that commercial according to
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
state law right now should be taxed
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh if a a community has in their town
 
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
uh if a a community has in their town
hall

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
hall
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh a building or a portion of the
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
building that they rent to somebody
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
it is that should also not be taxed
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
i should be taxed so if there's any
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
on that i'd be happy to try to field
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
them no thank you that
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
helped a lot thank you any additional
 
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
helped a lot thank you any additional

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised no none inside here
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other people willing
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
completely agree with what her testimony
indicated

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about um this
 
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about um this
commission

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
not exactly clear what will be
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
what will result from it um but i can
 
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
what will result from it um but i can
explain

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals are big um obviously big
 
00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
hospitals are big um obviously big
charitable

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
institutions um we um
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals make it a priority to
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
engage and collaborate with the
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
community partners to share resources
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
skills expertise leverage opportunities
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
to meet the most critical needs of their
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
communities and make the vision of a
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
healthy place a reality
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
we do have significant concerns about
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
this part too which would establish a
 
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
this part too which would establish a
commission

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
that in lieu of payment in lieu of taxes
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals do pay
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
23 of new hampshire's 26 community
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals are non-profit
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
three of them are for-profit under the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
hca umbrella
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
um and they are as ms reardon indicated
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
exempted from property taxes
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
under rsa 72 some of them however
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
have negotiated and made arrangements to
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
make payments in lieu of taxes
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as pilots those are
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
decisions made at a local level and we
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
believe that's where these decisions
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
should remain they are exempt from
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals are exempt from paying
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes in return for their
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
charitable benefits
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
they provide to the community so it's
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
not like they don't pay taxes and don't
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
provide anything um new hampshire's
 
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.670 align:start position:0%
provide anything um new hampshire's
hospitals

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
just um in 2018 had um
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
contributed over 500 million dollars in
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
community benefits um i have a report
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm happy to share with the
 
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.069 align:start position:0%
that i'm happy to share with the
committee

00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
that outlines what all went into that
 
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
that outlines what all went into that
but

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
a big portion of that is financial
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
assistance for those that
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
um cannot otherwise afford to pay for
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
their health care
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
um including the value of unreimbursed
 
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.309 align:start position:0%
um including the value of unreimbursed
medicaid

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
to not to name a couple hospitals do
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively and to identify and
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh assess the needs of their communities
 
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
uh assess the needs of their communities
through

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
detailed community needs assessments um
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
um every three years i believe
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
and those are provide those reports are
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
through the chair the office of
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
charitable trust in the attorney
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
um so decisions again about whether a
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
community and a non-profit hospital or
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
other entity should enter into a pilot
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
is a local decision we have them
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have one up in hanover we have them
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
in new london they're all over the state
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
but again that is negotiated and just to
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
if a hospital is um if there is a
 
00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
if a hospital is um if there is a
for-profit

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the hospital um
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
an independent prac not an independent
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
but a hospital
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
if they're own a physician office
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
building for instance they pay taxes on
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
if they rent it from the town um or the
 
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
if they rent it from the town um or the
city

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of them in concord for
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
instance that concord hospital rents
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
out a number of office buildings from
 
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
out a number of office buildings from
the

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
city um or from the landlord that's a
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
little different they don't pay taxes on
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
that for instance so it varies
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the state every single town
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
every single
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with the hospital in the
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
city is is different
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that this study
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
commission could create the expectation
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
as again ms reading indicated that
 
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
as again ms reading indicated that
nonprofits

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofits
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
exempt from property taxes be required
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
to enter into a pilot
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
that does take away from that their
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
charitable mission
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
and as i said hospitals contribute
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
currently 500 million dollars in chair
 
00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:16.230 align:start position:0%
currently 500 million dollars in chair
in

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
in community benefits and that would be
 
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
in community benefits and that would be
impacted

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that is a very big concern to us
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
because vulnerable
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
populations benefit from those community
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
benefits we don't
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
believe that this type of mandate from
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature is the right approach
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
and we believe the best approach would
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
be to lead these decisions to the local
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
decision makers to determine how best to
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
serve their communities
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
and that is my testimony on part two and
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
i will um
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i will shut down my video and then
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
when you're ready for part one i will um
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
come back when you're ready for me
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.349 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions

the committee room any questions
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%

you're speaking on part two of senate
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%

uh mr chairman and members of the
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael chance i'm
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
the ceo for the ymca of greater nashua
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here today on behalf of the ymca
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
alliance of new hampshire which is
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
comprised of nine ymcas in our state
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh the ymca alliance opposes part two of
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 to establish a
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
commission to study the pilots
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
the alliance feels this commission is
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and potentially harmful to
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
community-based non-profits like the y
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
that provide essential services to new
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire families
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
the first ymca in new hampshire we were
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
founded in 1852
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
today these nine wise serve more than
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
100 000 granite staters each year
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
through our programming and services the
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wives provide essential
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
services in our communities to some of
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
the state's most vulnerable residents
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
at the why these services include child
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
care hunger relief
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
community-based chronic disease
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
prevention programs
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
and by providing these ymcas i'm sorry
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
by providing these services
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
ymcas are actually lessening the burden
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
on government
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
our tax exempt status is a critical
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
component for us to be able to provide
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
these services
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
to people in need the new hampshire wise
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
we work hard to eliminate barriers so
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
that everybody can thrive the y in fact
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
a core portion of our mission is not
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
turning people away because of their
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
inability to pay
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
each year the new hampshire y's provide
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
an average of five million dollars in
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
financial assistance
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
for individuals in the state to be able
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
to access these services
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
these are scholarships for camp child
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
care wellness programs
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh requiring the wise to pay pilots
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
would have a significant and
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
negative impact on our ability to
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
provide these programs in this level of
 
00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
provide these programs in this level of
support

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh it would also disappropriately affect
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
those that are most
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in our community the
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
low-income families individuals with
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
seniors and immigrants we respectfully
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to remove part two of
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
mandated pilots would directly results
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
in the wide and other community-based

organizations
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
being forced to serve fewer of new
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%

to part one of senate bill 100
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
which dealt with a commission to study
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%

we are very supportive of part one of
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and we do thank senator gray for
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
introducing um this bill
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
for us a couple years ago um delay
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
it was reintroduced last year because it
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
never crossed over
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic from the senate
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
however it did pass the senate with
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
strong support
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
we along with other health care provider
 
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
we along with other health care provider
organizations

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
asked that the commission be established
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
to address the ongoing concerns
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
our health care workers face every day
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
while caring for patients
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
the sin the incidence of of violence in
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
against health care workers in new
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire and other health care settings
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
continues unfortunately
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other providers have
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
implemented various policies and
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
strategies to address
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
these growing concerns however we
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
believe a more comprehensive
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary approach is warranted
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
it should not be the expectation of a
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
nurse an aide
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
a physician or another caregiver to be
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
verbally or physically harmed while
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
doing their job
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
caring for others we do look forward to
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
working with the members of the
 
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
working with the members of the
commission

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
and as senator gray indicated it is um
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned um if you look at
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the members of the commission it is
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
definitely multi-disciplinary and that's
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we believe
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
is necessary to really dig into
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the issues and to address um i'm
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not sure which representative
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
asked the earlier question but on page
 
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
asked the earlier question but on page
two

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
starting on line 24 the
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
um charge of the commission is very
 
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.750 align:start position:0%
um charge of the commission is very
comprehensive

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it really would look at everything
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
and anything
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to address the concerns
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
that have been raised and to try to
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
determine again as a comprehensive
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
approach what we could what we could do
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be a statutory change or
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
what other um
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
tools there are to address this we do um
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
support the creation of the study
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
commission to focus on the healthcare
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
worker safety
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
so we can begin to work on with all
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the legislature
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
in this very important issue and i just
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
will point out that
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the pandemic it's
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
actually gotten worse
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
um we um and senator gray did try to get
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
this passed last year
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
because he understands this has been an
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
issue for a while
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten it has gotten worse and
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
um so we are
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
a little desperate um to get this
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
commission going so we
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
we do um strongly support it and
 
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.349 align:start position:0%
we do um strongly support it and
encourage

00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%

00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
my question is has the new hampshire
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
hospital association as a whole
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
done any preliminary studies hearings
 
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
done any preliminary studies hearings
investigations

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
for its hospitals concerning workplace
 
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.790 align:start position:0%
for its hospitals concerning workplace
safety

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
and as a second part of that question
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
and if they have what has come out
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
of that study that collaboration among
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
the different hospitals across the state
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question
 
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.589 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question
representative

00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
um so a couple things the security
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
officers collect
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
information on a monthly basis um
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the incidents um that
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
is kind of
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's confidential but the um idea was
 
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:08.790 align:start position:0%
that's confidential but the um idea was
to

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
aggregate that information um for the
 
00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:12.549 align:start position:0%
aggregate that information um for the
commission

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
um so we um are collecting that
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
information from them
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
um and then our um our commission on uh
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
quality commission and patient safety
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
commission which
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
um has met for over 20 years it is a
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
permanent commission
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
on the legislature made that a permanent
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
commission a couple years ago um
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
by a bill sponsored by senator rosenwald
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
they have also been working on this
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
again that is um protected information
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
um that is the way that the commission
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
has been established
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
um so they various hospitals that
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
includes every single hospital in the
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
state and every single um ambulatory
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
surgery center in the state
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
they cl they have been working on this
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
issue as well
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
um in various um components and
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
and then um i think representative
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh i apologize senator
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
gray was talking about some of the
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
training um the de-escalation
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
training um that was started actually by
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
the state uh by the state hospital and
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's called secure
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's an acronym um and i apologize i
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
i should know what it is but i don't off
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the top of my head um
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that is basically de-escalation
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
training that we got a grant
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
um the foundation for healthy
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
communities which is an affiliate of the
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
hospital association was able to access
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
a grant
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for that training and
 
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.910 align:start position:0%
to pay for that training and
pre-pandemic

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
the um folks including the chief
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
security officer who's part of the state
 
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.349 align:start position:0%
security officer who's part of the state
police

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the state hospital was going around
 
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.790 align:start position:0%
from the state hospital was going around
training

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
hospital e.d staffs and others
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and a number of
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals took advantage of that
 
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
hospitals took advantage of that
training

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that got shut down when
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit last
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
march and has not started up again due
 
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
march and has not started up again due
to

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
our limitations with visitors etc um so
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
i would say that we've done a lot
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
um the problem is we can't
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
go further without getting others
 
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.549 align:start position:0%
go further without getting others
involved

00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
including the court system including the
 
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.790 align:start position:0%
including the court system including the
state

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
there are limitations relative to
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
what can be done based on state law um
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what we that's why we need the
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
commission um and as senator gray
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
said he brought a number of stakeholders
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
together oh gosh
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
senator gray i'm trying to remember when
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
that was but probably 2018
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
when a constituent of his raised this
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
issue and we've been working
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
on this ever since so um again yes the
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals do a lot
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not a multi-disciplinary
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
approach and that's what this commission
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
would be charged with
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for that i i
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
that security officers have been
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
collecting data
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
i also understand that the quality
 
00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:05.670 align:start position:0%
i also understand that the quality
commission

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
working on it has protective information
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
and i also understand that training has
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
occurred through the secure act
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
my question really was has the
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital association
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
created a group of folks to look at all
 
00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:23.430 align:start position:0%
created a group of folks to look at all
this

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that we do have some
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
information that's protected
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
that could be set aside in just the
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
incident or whatever it was brought
 
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.670 align:start position:0%
incident or whatever it was brought
forward

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
has the new hampshire hospital
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
association sat and met
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issues the quality
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
issues and the training issue and talked
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
about the best practice for them going
 
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
about the best practice for them going
forward

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
rather than bringing it forward to the
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislature in a condition where there's
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
already a commission that perhaps
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
um so i would say that yes they have
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
again done this primarily through the
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
quality commission
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
the issue is this is happening in
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is happening in um in the home for
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
home care
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
workers um and nurses unfortunately when
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
they the
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
so we need um so we need the
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the nurses association we need the
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
hospice and home care association
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
the long-term care association the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare association the hospital
 
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.549 align:start position:0%
healthcare association the hospital
association

00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
um along with the um others that are
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
um along with the um others that are
listed

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
on um the medical society we we need all
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
everyone to be at the table including
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
the um the employees
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
the state employees association etc to
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office because
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
again there are laws that are
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
limiting um whether what can more can be
 
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.549 align:start position:0%
limiting um whether what can more can be
done

00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so yes we have done a lot
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
um we have done a lot the problem is we
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
um we need to do more
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and and the security officers work
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
day and night
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
on their they work 24 7 to protect
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the staff

i as an emergency room nurse i have

personally experienced
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%

never have experienced

any physical assault however a 2009
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
study conducted by the emergency nurses

association
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
found that 25 of the respondents
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
to this survey had experienced physical
 
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:48.870 align:start position:0%
to this survey had experienced physical

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
assault
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
more than 20 times in the past three
 
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.990 align:start position:0%
more than 20 times in the past three
years

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
another uh 20 of the respondents had
 
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.589 align:start position:0%
another uh 20 of the respondents had
experienced

00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
verbal abuse more than 200 times in the
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
past three years
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
even more concerning however was the
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of the nurses in this
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
survey did not report
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
these incidences the the reasons are
 
01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:10.870 align:start position:0%
these incidences the the reasons are
multi-factorial

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
multi-factorial
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh such as they don't they understand
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
the patient was
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
not in their right mind that they were
 
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
not in their right mind that they were
perhaps

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
experiencing delirium or dementia and
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
they didn't want the patient to get in
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
trouble but nonetheless
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is a pervasive problem within all
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
health care settings and i would echo
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
what paula minihan mentioned that it's
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
not strictly limited to
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
emergency departments and hospitals but
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's pervasive or happens
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
in all healthcare settings ambulatory
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
care settings
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
long-term care settings home care
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
settings so urgent
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
care so it really needs to be a
 
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.829 align:start position:0%
care so it really needs to be a
comprehensive

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
commission to examine this problem
 
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.069 align:start position:0%
commission to examine this problem
extensively

01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
further i'd add that the american nurses
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
association conducted a survey in 2019
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
and the results of this survey of
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of nurses across the
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
country found that one in four nurses
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
had experienced
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
a physical or verbal assault yet again
 
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.630 align:start position:0%
a physical or verbal assault yet again
here

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
20 to 60 of these assaults went
 
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.910 align:start position:0%
20 to 60 of these assaults went
unreported

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
unreported
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
by the nurse um
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
we conducted i worked with paula minahan
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 i participated in the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
meeting that senator gray called
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
of multiple stakeholders at that time i
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
was the executive director of the new
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire nurses association
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
which i'm not currently in that capacity
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
at that time we orchestrated a study
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
done for merrimack county here in new
 
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.950 align:start position:0%
done for merrimack county here in new
hampshire

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and that study um found that 24
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the nurses reported experiencing
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
physical acts of aggression
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
and 35 percent experienced some level of
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
verbal aggression
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
and again almost 20 percent reported
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
that they didn't report
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
these incidences so we i really want to
 
01:01:59.119 --> 01:01:59.670 align:start position:0%
these incidences so we i really want to
encourage

01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
oh um one other thing um there i've i've
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
um a nursing emergency nurse colleague
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm hopeful that she's here to
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
testify today or will submit written
 
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
testify today or will submit written
testimony

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
but this nursing colleague was assaulted
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
in the emergency department while on
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
duty back last fall
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
and was strangled to unconsciousness by
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
a psychiatrically boarding patient
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
in fact um when i was in graduate school
 
01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
in fact um when i was in graduate school
i

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
wrote a paper uh because a patient a
 
01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.029 align:start position:0%
wrote a paper uh because a patient a
nurse

01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
the patient attacked a nurse at elliot
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
hospital back in 2015
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
and that patient was killed as a result
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
of this attack
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
so my the paper i wrote was on the issue
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
of psychiatric boarding in the emergency
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
department and that
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know we need to do something about
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
that and fortunately the state did look
 
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:46.789 align:start position:0%
that and fortunately the state did look
into

01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
that and i was pleased that that that
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
had become less of a problem of course
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
until a pandemic came out and the
 
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:52.870 align:start position:0%
until a pandemic came out and the
problem

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
has been exacerbated so anyway um
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'm more
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
than happy to take questions on this
 
01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:02.789 align:start position:0%

subject
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh we do
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
have one question representative ruler
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think i am the question gail today uh
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm awful sorry but if you said your
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
name i didn't get that
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
my name is joan widmer um my clinical
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
background is that
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
as an emergency nurse but i have also
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
served in
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
um advocacy capacities for the new
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire nurses association
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the emergency nurses association yes
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
other than just getting your name i do
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the folks that come
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
into the emergency room
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
may have psychiatric issues whether it
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
be the elderly with dementia
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
or the violent or mentally ill folks
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
that come in and actually are the ones
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that do the assault
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
the verbal abuse and some of the
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
physical assault
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
is is combined as a problem and so
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
i wonder if we have seen in the state of
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
um more reporting since we've become
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
aware of this
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
by way of hospital policy and procedures
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
with not only the nurses association in
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state but if you're in any kind of a
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
national organization if that has become
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh something that we need to put forward
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
and have we done that already
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the way of policies certainly um i
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
know that for instance the american
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
nurses association
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
is actively advocating that nurses
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
report all incidences
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and i know that um there are uh
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
superstructures in place
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
within most um hospital organizations to
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
um encourage reporting however i
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
remember in a conversation with paula
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
minnigan several years ago
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
and she mentioned that um you know the
 
01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:50.390 align:start position:0%
and she mentioned that um you know the
the

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
number of reported incidences by
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals varies dramatically
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
if a memory serves me from zero to 400
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
incidences in
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the past year so clearly
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy regardless of
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
hospital institutional size
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue of whether things
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
are reported or not and i think
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
to some extent it depends on the nurses
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
management and
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
or the the executive management within
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
the the organization
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
but again that is limited to hospital
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
settings and this
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
situation is not at all limited to
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
hospital situations
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
however i do agree that i think nurses
 
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
however i do agree that i think nurses
are

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
being sensitized to the importance of
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
reporting it no nurse wants to see a
 
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.589 align:start position:0%
reporting it no nurse wants to see a
patient

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
who is not in their right faculties so
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
be punished inappropriately however
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
short of reporting it there are other
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
things that we can do
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
as an organization or as a state through
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
this commission other things that can be
 
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
this commission other things that can be
done

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
such as de-escalation techniques often
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're limited to emergency department
 
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.390 align:start position:0%
they're limited to emergency department
nurses

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
however we have patients experiencing
 
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.829 align:start position:0%
however we have patients experiencing
delirium

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
delirium
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
and in the icu we have patients
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
experiencing dementia in long-term care
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
so it it really can't be constrained to
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
just emergency nursing staff
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers your question
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
it it does but i'd like to follow up
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
with one that came out of your response
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
the de-escalation techniques has that
 
01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:20.069 align:start position:0%
the de-escalation techniques has that
become

01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
a state policy with the nurses
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
association in new hampshire
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
for training for not only just emergency
 
01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:27.829 align:start position:0%
for training for not only just emergency
rooms

01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
but for nursing on all levels or
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
practitioners on all levels i'm not
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
aware of any state
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
policy one way or the other i believe
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that most
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals and most healthcare
 
01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
hospitals and most healthcare
organizations

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
have some level of policy that within
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
their institution but it goes very
 
01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
their institution but it goes very
dramatically

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
i know for instance when i first became
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
an emergency room nurse
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
i was trained in um what's called moab
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
management of aggressive behavior and in
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques but that
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
training was not provided to me when i
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
another inpatient unit so again even
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
within an institution the level of
 
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.109 align:start position:0%
within an institution the level of
training

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
um is is varied and there are again
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
other techniques besides that
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
so for instance maybe there's uh
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
conveniently placed emergency
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
notification bells
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
or devices worn on the person i know
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
some hospitals in different states have
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
emergency call buttons that all staff
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
wear at all times
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
so again there's a lot of different
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
things we can do but in order to know
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
what's right for us here in new
 
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.029 align:start position:0%
what's right for us here in new
hampshire

01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this commission is to get
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders together to talk
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
about the issue and
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
then to propose solutions that will help
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
to truly address the problem and it's
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
not always a law enforcement issue but
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
it might be other things as well thank
 
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.789 align:start position:0%
it might be other things as well thank
you

01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
or on zoom seeing none i would like to
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
follow up with one
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
um uh paula manahan mentioned
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh that laws are limiting what can be
 
01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh that laws are limiting what can be
done

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
um are you also uh testifying to
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
that and and would you be aware of any
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
of these laws that
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
are limiting what can be done
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not my
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise so i can't offer
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
anything there i apologize no
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's perfectly valid
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
answer thank you very much for
 
01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
answer thank you very much for
testifying

everyone to to vote out to pass on this
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
particular part of the bill it's
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's long overdue and very very needed
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
this would be the time that anyone any
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
member of the public that would like to
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none we're going to close part 1
 
01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:09.340 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 move to
 
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 move to
[Music]

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
part 3 of senate bill 100 which is
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
differentiate the cost of education and
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of care for children in a
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
residential facility
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the experience that they
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
had in the senate
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
when this bill was heard
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
no one testified no one introduced it
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
no one testified no one introduced it
actually

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually mr chairman i think we did talk
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
about part three earlier
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
right um it was introduced here
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh by senator avard but um
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
but that was at my behest because we
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have anyone
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
sign up to to introduce it
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
right grant bossie appeared for senator
 
01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:06.390 align:start position:0%
right grant bossie appeared for senator
ward

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
ward
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay great uh
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
and mr boss he spoke on part three
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes he did okay great um i'm catching up
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
here too as well
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's complicated it is it is
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
so having no one else willing to
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
or wanting to testify on part three
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to close the hearing on part
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
three and
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
we've already done part four so we would
 
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
we've already done part four so we would
jump

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
jump
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone signed up or anyone
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to speak
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
to part four establishing a
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
we will close the hearing on part 4 of
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 and move
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
to part 5. of
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 establishing a committee
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right it's been introduced yet yeah
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
that was not introduced no senator avar
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
didn't introduce me
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
he did it i've got a text message from
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
senator avard saying he had to leave
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
i thought he was going to testify he was
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
senator uh representative ruler would

i am a member of the legi admin i'm

01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
part five of senate bill 100
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is establishing a committee to
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
study the effects of covert 19 lockdowns
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um and hearing that there are
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%

okay yep let's bring up representative
harrigan

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
harrigan
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative administration
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much mr chair i'm
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much mr chair i'm
rev

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
rev
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
timothy horrigan from trafford county
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
district six the towns of durham
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
and madbury or as i like to call it a
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
greater bad berry
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i think this part five is
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
valuable i think you might uh
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
might want to reword the section a
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
little bit because
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
now of course it just says the effects
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
of cohort 19 like down
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
quarantine school business closings um
 
01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.430 align:start position:0%
quarantine school business closings um
but

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
of course you can study i guess the
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
beneficial effects because uh
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think uh you know the the kuvin 19 um
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic the virus is one of you know
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's extraordinarily dangerous
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's killed more people in the united
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
states i think anything since the
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
civil war took millions nationwide and
 
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
civil war took millions nationwide and
um

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
certainly the the uh various things that
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
we tried
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh to slow down the spread of the
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic um they were
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
but they did have some side effects i
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is like just this
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
proposal a little bit over
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
over overly slanted towards you know the
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
negative effects
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
of the various public health measures
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
that were taken so
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
maybe rewording it a little bit would be
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
nice and actually
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
might even be good to have some better
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
data about the actual effects of the
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
virus itself on the people of new
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire because i think there's
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit lack of clarity on that um
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we certainly
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
we probably all got a large number of
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
emails about another bill that's
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
in edna and there are people actually
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying with a straight face for example
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
that uh the vaccine makes you more
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous to people around you which
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much flies in the face of like
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
200 years of science and so i think
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think perhaps broadening the scope of
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
it a little bit to a get some more hard
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
data about
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
what actually did happen to us during
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and you know
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
b maybe talk about how these measures
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually work it's not just about parts
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't work and there's also of
 
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.229 align:start position:0%
that didn't work and there's also of
course

01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of uh how well we distribute
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccines and then the
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
treatments not that we have very many
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
effective treatments but um
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that's uh so i'm um
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
not actually against having this uh
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee but i think it needs to uh
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think we need to support a very
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
different and broader scope for it than
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
just the narrow issues that uh
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
came over in the senate so that's uh
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say uh gonna say briefly not
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
as briefly as i thought it was going to
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that thank you thank you for your
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
you for having me back uh senator avard
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
did have to leave for other hearings
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very busy day
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
here at the state house he wanted me to
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
talk to you about
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh the reasons he introduced this
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission a
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
constituent actually came to him with a
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
request that there are unintended
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
consequences to the unprecedented
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
actions we've taken over the last year
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to slow the spread of the covet 19 virus
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
particularly among vulnerable
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
populations and i think we're just
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
starting to realize what some of those
 
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.149 align:start position:0%
starting to realize what some of those
are

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
the senator thought it would be a good
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
idea to have a
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
disciplined look at the effect that
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
the isolation that we've imposed on
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves has had
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
on vulnerable students on people with
 
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.189 align:start position:0%
on vulnerable students on people with
ptsd

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
ptsd
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
let's look at what this time locked in
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
our homes
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
communicating only through screens has
 
01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
communicating only through screens has
had

01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
and if there are any uh follow-ups that
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
we can have
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
any policy solutions we can have
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
to address those consequences and
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
as is the case of anybody suggesting a
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
senator evert is willing to serve on
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
that study committee if
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
need be so i thank you for your
 
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.910 align:start position:0%
need be so i thank you for your
consideration

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr bossie uh would you be
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions or
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
i would i would likely have to uh get
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
those questions to senator avar but i'll
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
do my best
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
excellent um i have one hand from
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative ruler
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
i guess you can guess who's going to ask
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
the question um
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that senator avad would
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
serve on this and
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
the prior testimony would like to expand
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
the bill to positive
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
issues treatments vaccines and how it's
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
affected positively
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
would you please ask senator avad if he
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee i will uh
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
forward that question on to him
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i see a hand
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative expedia thank you mr
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
chair and uh just you know if you could
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
pass this message along as well i see
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the committee is made up of
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
mostly legislators and i think
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know for given given what some of
 
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
you know for given given what some of
the

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
or some of the outcomes you want to see
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
and seeing you know you want if
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to truly have this committee
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think you would need to expand it to
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
definitely have
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean education uh for educators you
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
would need i mean
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
given that you would probably need to
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
expand it to also include
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
um people in the medical field um
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think if you want to make it as
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
comprehensive as possible
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
and truly study lockdowns i think rather
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
than just have legislators i
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know i think we have some great
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
legislators who are who are
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
members of um the health field but i
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
we would probably have to take a bigger
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
look at it and it will probably have to
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
be amended so
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
um if you could pass that on to the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
senator that would be great
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative i think what
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about would be the
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
difference between a study committee
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is generally
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh made up of legislators it's it's a
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
group of lawmakers that create this
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc or sometimes official group
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
to study a particular issue and what
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about would be a study
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
commission which would say
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
have the uh the commissioner of
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
education the commissioner of dhhs
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
and uh a number of stakeholder groups
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
that are laid out in a
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
larger more formal process whether you
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
go with a study committee or a study
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
commission obviously that's a decision
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
that you as the committee have to make
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
senator evart thought that this would be
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate as a study committee
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
and nothing would preclude that
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
committee from calling in commissioner
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
blue commissioner shibanet
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
experts on ptsd experts on
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with children with autism
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
whatever experts need to
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
be heard from could then be brought into
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
the study committee to make sure we
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
heard from them
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't think there's anything
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent between what senator evard
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
is looking for and what you're talking
 
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.149 align:start position:0%
is looking for and what you're talking
about

01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the question is just what sort of
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
structure are you having do you want a
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
or do you want a study commission all
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
no further questions for
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
mr bossie seeing none thank you very
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
much grant
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
good to see you again thank you and i'm
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
around for part six as well when you get
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh we may be at that now
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
are we at that now no other hands raise
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
for part
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
five you're up grant
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
go uh thank you this also from senator
 
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
go uh thank you this also from senator
avard

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
avard
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with the jetty out at uh
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampton beach
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's um you know kind of a rock pier uh
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it's point four miles extending out
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
into the atlantic ocean
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
it is a very popular hiking trail people
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
like to walk out onto it
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and kind of get the view from the middle
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the ocean as opposed to from the
 
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
of the ocean as opposed to from the
beach

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
beach
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
however it is not particularly safe
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh people have fallen off they've been
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh search and rescue missions
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
um been called for and uh
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
it is certainly not uh handicapped
 
01:21:24.639 --> 01:21:25.669 align:start position:0%
it is certainly not uh handicapped
accessible

01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
so uh people with any sort of
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
um whether from wheelchair or just
 
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
um whether from wheelchair or just
walking

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
walking
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
people that have trouble walking
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
unassisted and need a cane
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
they can't go out on the jetty so
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
senator rayvard wanted to study the idea
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
of building a pier out over that jetty
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
so you could have
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
accessibility to the public in what is a
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
very popular

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
the he also underlines that
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that the new
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire state parks
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
they is operationally self-funded
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
through the revenue collected from fees
 
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.149 align:start position:0%
through the revenue collected from fees
services

01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
services

rentals and retail so and so
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
expanding visitor access to the state
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
park is a worthy endeavor
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
and let's provided we have to continue
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
make certain that
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
we continue the parks revenue stream to
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
ensure the long-term viability
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
and financial health of the
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
he asked that the study committee will
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
while he goes on and asked that the
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
agencies they'll be responsible for the
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
inspection and ongoing maintenance and
 
01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
inspection and ongoing maintenance and
repairs

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the of the pier so uh
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
he said thank you for the opportunity to

thank you um would you would you be able
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
to explain a little bit
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
um i understand a project like this the
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
the peer over the jetty would not be
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
um from the general fund it would be
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
handled from
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
their own self-contained
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
revenue source uh no the uh uh
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
well first of all i don't know where the
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
funding would would come from that would
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
be i think something that the com
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
that the peer uh that the peer committee
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh have to have to decide on or look for
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh nor what uh we the
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
there are no general funds for
 
01:27:41.199 --> 01:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
there are no general funds for
operational

01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
operational
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh activities on the park in other words
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
paying them tickets or from or getting
 
01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
paying them tickets or from or getting
in

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh is all that's the that is the source
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
of park funding you know
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the plates and other
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
other other items
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
the there is uh
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
the parks system does get funds from the
 
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
the parks system does get funds from the
state

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
for capital improvements uh
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that uh so so there have been uh
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
capital improvement funds from from the
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
state to find to
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
my knowledge but no operational funds no
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
there's no general funds
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh comes from that where the funding
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
would come from
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh is a good question i mean if i mean
 
01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
uh is a good question i mean if i mean
the

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh but the committee will have
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
to find out
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
possibly you know just looking ahead
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that the
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
availability of federal funding might
 
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
availability of federal funding might
have

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
might be available especially there
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
seems to be a lot of money flying around
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
so but again
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
these are all things that this uh
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee would have to look at
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i would hope they'd look at it yes
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%

up on that um
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
lately i've been hearing on the news
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the governor is interested in using
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
some of this federal money
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
um for four different projects one of
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
um state parks would would that
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
type would that be a trigger for
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
type would that be a trigger for
something

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
of a project like this is that the kind
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
of thing i
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
they did indicate that none of the rules
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
received as yet but is that the kind of
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
money you're talking about
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%

to part two and then we'll allow the
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
remaining time to senator carson
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay sounds great um good morning
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record i'm
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
senator rebecca perkins coca from senate
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
district 21 representing the city of
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%

newmarket and new fields i'm the prime
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of part two
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
of sb 142 fn reestablishing the
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee to study
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
barriers to increase land development in
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
the reason for re-establishing the
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
commission previously known as the sb-43
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
commission or the density commission
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that it did not get to complete its
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
work i hope that we can all agree the
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
need for housing is urgent in our state
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it's imperative that we continue
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
pushing to find solutions that we can
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
add to the toolbox
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
our job at the state level is to provide
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
support resources
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
ideas and tools to our municipalities so
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
they can meaningfully engage in planning
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
and policy conversations around housing
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
in its own future
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
with awareness of the overall impact to
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state in our economy
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic this important
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
conversation initiated by senator fuller
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
clark was unable to meet sufficiently to
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
finish its mission
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
so i asked the committee to vote ought
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
to pass to allow the group to resume its
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
work and look ahead to the next wave of
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
housing legislation
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%

um the third part of the bill seeks to
 
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
um the third part of the bill seeks to
re-establish

01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
re-establish
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
the commission to study grand families
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
um this was a piece of legislation that
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
was passed a few years ago
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and it was noted at the time as being uh
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation piece of
 
01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.030 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation piece of
legislation

01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
during the opioid crisis to engross to
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
involve grandparents in the process
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
they have done an incredible amount of
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
work and have been a great resource
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the division of youth and
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
family services
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
and department of health and human
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
services and
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
all this legislation does is it allows
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
us to continue its work for
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
five more years um and i'd also like to
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
bring up the point that
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
um they have also been affected by the
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
opioid and ethiopia but
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
by coving by not being able to meet so
 
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.390 align:start position:0%
by coving by not being able to meet so
that

01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
that hasn't helped either um i just
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
recently read an article
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh that because of covid we've
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
kind of put the opioid issue on the back
 
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.109 align:start position:0%
kind of put the opioid issue on the back
burner

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
burner
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately they're predicting
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
that this issue is going to surge to the
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
forefront again
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
just because of um the isolation
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the other social um byproducts i
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
guess if you want to call it
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
of um of coven and that they're
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
predicting we're going to see a surge of
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh cases where people are going to need
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
help because
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
of an addiction to an opioid so
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to keep this commission in
 
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to keep this commission in
place

01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
allow them to continue to work providing
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
families and to the state and quite
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
frankly to the legislative legislators
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
by providing accurate and up-to-date
 
01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.310 align:start position:0%
by providing accurate and up-to-date
information

01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
on what grandparents face when they're
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
given custody
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
of their children we had passed a few a
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
law a few years ago
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that gave grandparents really the first
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
right to take their grandchildren rather
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
than putting them in foster care
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
um we think this is a great thing and it
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
has worked very very well for
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
us here for in new hampshire um
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
we all six new england states do have
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
commissions on grand families
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and again we just like to be able to
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
continue this commission

01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
lot of that
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%

over the next five years even though we
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to come
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the next five years but do you have
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
anything in in your site that you would
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
like to accomplish
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
with this commission ins specifically
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative roulard
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of things that i'd
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
like to see i think
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
first and foremost is to strengthen
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
those ties
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we that this order that this
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
commission has with the state
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
you are correct they have been an
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
excellent resource
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
for uh for our state in providing
 
01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
for uh for our state in providing
information

01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
to make it much much easier for families
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
to get help on grand families i'd also
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
like to see stronger connections with
 
01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
like to see stronger connections with
non-profits

01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think that that is key um for the uh
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
just for informational purposes
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
i am the vice chair of the new hampshire
 
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:35.669 align:start position:0%
i am the vice chair of the new hampshire
foster

01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
foster
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
and adoptive parents association and
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of work with grand families
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
where uh for whatever reason children
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
taken away from their parents and
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
they're given to get to grandparents who
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
just all of a sudden find their was
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for these children
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't have resources
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think we know that a lot of grand
 
01:43:59.040 --> 01:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
i think we know that a lot of grand
families

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
um they struggle financially and they
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
need help
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that i'd like
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
to see this commission do
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
is to make stronger ties with the
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit community
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
to help grand families uh be successful
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in taking care of their children
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%

by mr frost that the work has been rich
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time to help inform

all of us who are working to address
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
our state's affordable housing crisis
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%

the committee room no anyone on zoom
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
no it looks like you're good to go you
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%

01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
taking the time and for your patience
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
are there any other hands raised
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
i see none um with that i would like to
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on senate bill 142.
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
done um
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative wall yes you had a
 
01:54:43.679 --> 01:54:44.629 align:start position:0%
representative wall yes you had a
suggestion

01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
my suggestion was that we have
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me discussion as a whole for the
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
whole committee
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
rather than break up into caucuses
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
because there's so much here
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
and um thinking of what
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
former chairman pinch said in honor of
 
01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
former chairman pinch said in honor of
him

01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
and they're on the system that we had
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
back in judiciary uh
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh clear i was going to call you senator
 
01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
uh clear i was going to call you senator
roulard

01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
roulard
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do it again but have an
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
open discussion for the committee as a
 
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
open discussion for the committee as a
whole

01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
almost as a work session rather as a
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
work session yes as opposed to breaking
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
up into caucuses
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
i think it would be more efficient more
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
effective and i think we could iron out
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
our questions more readily that way
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
well it um thank you uh i
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with you at all um it
 
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:37.750 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with you at all um it
is

01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock um
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
we own the room for the day um what i
 
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
we own the room for the day um what i
would

01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
like to suggest is that we
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
um create something of a work session
 
01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
um create something of a work session
here

01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the entire committee and
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
and discuss um if there are
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of information that um
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee members would or would like to
 
01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.390 align:start position:0%
committee members would or would like to
have

01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
and and give us some time there
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
um i'll let you in on a little secret i
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
plan on
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
submitting tomorrow to the calendar
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
an executive session announcement for
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
next thursday a week from this thursday
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
so that would give us a time for
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
um possible amendments to be put
 
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.669 align:start position:0%
um possible amendments to be put
together

01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
um gives us a a week and
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
a week and a day right or we can two
 
01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.229 align:start position:0%
a week and a day right or we can two
days

01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
um so i'm perfectly
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
willing to unmute anyone that
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh has comments or questions or
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
um or thoughts about either of these two
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
bills and
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank goodness we don't have eight or
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
ten of these
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills quite frankly so
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
um if anyone has
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
comments to make or questions they have
 
01:57:07.679 --> 01:57:08.149 align:start position:0%
comments to make or questions they have
about

01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
any of this the we have six
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine nine parts to this um
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to entertain them if we need
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
this would be a good time to discuss
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
something if we need
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
um pam to research something for us
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
in any of those parts um are we gonna
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
take them in order right now from
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
do sp 100 and then sp 142 or i think
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a free-for-all
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
in this in this group um if you have
 
01:57:38.239 --> 01:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
in this in this group um if you have
something

01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative um just tell us what
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
what part you want to talk about and go
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay well i um it's a little unusual i'm
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
usually used to going to caucus and then
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to this but um
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
on my behalf i think you know there are
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
great points to 142 um
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that's you know i support i think
 
01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.510 align:start position:0%
and that's you know i support i think
all

01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:58:06.250 --> 01:58:06.260 align:start position:0%
three of them all three parts of it um
 
01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:07.669 align:start position:0%
three of them all three parts of it um
[Music]

01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think housing is an
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think you know making sure we take
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
care of our first responders
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
um especially as they're going through
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know so much
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh ptsd uh post-traumatic stresses
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then i think um do like you know
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
i believe that foster parents have an
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
important role or sorry not um
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
grandparents have an important role to
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
play during the opioid crisis as we
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
start you know
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
as we work to to figure you know
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
how we can take care of our kids who are
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
who are affected by this so
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
i you know i have no problems at all
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
with actually with 142.
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm very happy with 142. sb 100 is a
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
different story and
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
i think that one for me is much more of
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay are there are there any pieces
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
of information um on senate bill 100
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
that you still
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
need to uh that are
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't have in testimony are
 
01:59:10.719 --> 01:59:12.229 align:start position:0%
that we don't have in testimony are
there

01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
other items that you're looking for in
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
help your thought process on senate bill
 
01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
help your thought process on senate bill
100

01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i think the um
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
the items around i don't mean to put you
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
on the spot here
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know you're fine um i think the
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue of like i think what was that part
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
let me just pull it up i think it was
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
part one um
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
part two i want to say but the issues
 
01:59:43.199 --> 01:59:44.470 align:start position:0%
part two i want to say but the issues
around

01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
um the pilots yeah
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a little i mean i
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
understand the study
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
part of it but i just think that there
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
is i have some reservations around it
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts on either of these is that um
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative wall you would you
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
brought this up is there something that
 
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:09.430 align:start position:0%
brought this up is there something that
you

02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh um well do i have to push this button
 
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.189 align:start position:0%
uh um well do i have to push this button
still

02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i think for them i don't know can you
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
rip me over there
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
can the people on zoom here yep okay
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you're good
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay um i have some concerns about
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
so many commissions as opposed to study
 
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:45.589 align:start position:0%
so many commissions as opposed to study
committees

02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
um we were advised a few years ago that
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
commissions were taking up too much time
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
for outside
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
members for example for people from the
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
state agencies and departments taking
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
them away from their own
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
jobs and that study committees were much
 
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:01.669 align:start position:0%
jobs and that study committees were much
more

02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
advisable because every single one of
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
these people
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is list who is listed could very
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
well come in and testify
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
at any time the committee would need
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
them to but wouldn't have to be there as
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
a commission member
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
um as commission members i don't know
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
for sure if they would have voting
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
rights i mean
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
really and truly the purpose of these
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees is to have
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
further legislation to resolve specific
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
problems that come out of the
 
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
problems that come out of the
information

02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's garnered from all this work and
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
they will be a lot of work
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
however looking at the dockets on both
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
of these
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100 and senate bill 142
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
even with amendment they passed the
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
senate unanimously on roll call votes
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm shifting my position a little
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
bit from saying i really really prefer
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
study committees which i do to say
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
these commissions are set up pretty well
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and since the senate is fully committed
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
100 percent to working on these which is
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
a rarity
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm more in support of going with
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
the commission concepts and not and not
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
targeting them to try to alter them and
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
i um just to
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
just to branch off a little bit from
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
from i too have always had an aversion
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
to commissions
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
first of all and i've had a aversion to
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
committees second of all um
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
and and i've had aversions or kind of
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
um snicker up my sleeve here when i see
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
two senators showing up at a
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh at a commission um i think that's so
 
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:46.709 align:start position:0%
uh at a commission um i think that's so
that

02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
they have a better shot at getting one
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
of them to show up at a
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
at a commission quite frankly um they
 
02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:53.270 align:start position:0%
at a commission quite frankly um they
are

02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're notoriously not um
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
great at attendance but um but i also
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
have some
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
questions about um well i guess it's the
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
more so i'll use as an example the
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
commission on the on the grand families
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
that goes out five years um
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
how do you and and
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
what happens if you're no longer
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
a representative or a senator in that
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
time period
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
um where is the where's the substitution
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
scheme and all of that i don't i don't
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
know how that works
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
go it doesn't
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the thing is we can't commit future
 
02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
and the thing is we can't commit future
legislatures

02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
we just can't so we would have to alter
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
the deadlines for reporting purposes
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
in order to make anything like that work
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
however that particular one is a very
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
very important one
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
i still think that if they get to work
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
and get the job done
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
say by whatever the reporting today
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be november 1 or something this
 
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
would be november 1 or something this
year

02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
um then i could support that but
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
extending it a number of years is way
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
too long and
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
actually if we have a reporting date say
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
november one of this year just as
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
for example um we can always extend it
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the second year because we have
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
another year left
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to extend it beyond
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
there at all
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think that goes out to 2020
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
26. i have a question so janet you're
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that november 1st 2022
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
as the end as the end i see okay
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
i i that's not a bad idea
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that um i
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
i mentioned what my concern is i just
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how you
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
have any idea what this commission would
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
look like um
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's a crap shoot you anyone else up
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
comment

02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
and sherry are have been very quiet
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
today i don't
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
know if they're really even there quite
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
frankly um
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
i am absolutely here i just don't really
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
have anything
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
pertinent to add okay all right
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it um
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
it seems that um aside from this the
 
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.069 align:start position:0%
it seems that um aside from this the
timing

02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
timing
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
um do we have uh do we have
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
similar thoughts about commissions
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know is that is that what mass
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
is hearing
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
i prefer committees to commissions i
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
think the grand families commission
 
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:47.669 align:start position:0%
think the grand families commission
though

02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be an exception i think they have
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of stuff and they
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
probably will continue
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
to look at a lot of stuff we haven't
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
heard anything about
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
changing the committee makeup and
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the grand families at all we did hear
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
through private through conversations
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
about um
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
one or two changes in the membership and
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
the membership okay
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's the other part of this i don't
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
remember which one of these
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
but there was something like 26 people
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
on how do you how do you get anything
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
done with 26 people
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes history shows that here in the
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
legislature uh that it doesn't work and
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
i can go back to when we first
 
02:06:30.239 --> 02:06:31.350 align:start position:0%
i can go back to when we first
established

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
the right to know commission excuse me
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
again i apologize for
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
being hoarse it must be the work being
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
done outside but anyway um
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work and when you have a
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
size and you say the quorum has to be
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
seven people or eight people
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
then what's the point in having such a
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
huge commission in the first place
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
especially when they are able to
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
bring in anyone that they want um
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm not sure the purpose um
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just my thought and mr
 
02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:03.669 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just my thought and mr
chairman

02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
if i may please um again it's the
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislators the senators and the state
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
reps who have
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to draft legislation and all
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh they need
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
information from these other very
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
important sources
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
but again i i strongly support calling
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
these people in
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
and letting the real workers um
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
the real uh ones who have to draft the
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and all and work with it
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
straight and follow through
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be the ones who will be serving and
 
02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
to be the ones who will be serving and
that's

02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i lean more towards i study
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
committees on very important subjects if
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have to have something like that at
 
02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
we have to have something like that at
all

02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
um not as a result not not to
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
not to pre-judge or determine what
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
what's going to come out of any of these
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
committees or where
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're only charged here to determine
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
whether there will be such a committee
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
or commission
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
but i still have doubts in my mind
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
what can be done about some of these
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
things um
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know studying the workplace safety
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
in healthcare city
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'll bring that up for one
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there is a law that we can
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
that we can impose or or
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
strengthen that helps that
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
but again we're not the ones that
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
determine that we're only determining
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
whether a commission
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
exists or not to study that i
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
it just some things i just i'm not sure
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's that same phrase you know it's hard
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
morality there's other things that it's
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
hard to legislate safety
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
um you can increase the penalty but it
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's going to make things any safer
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
exactly and i'm not trying to
 
02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.830 align:start position:0%
exactly and i'm not trying to
predetermine

02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
predetermine
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
any outcome for any of these because
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
awful lot of work to be done on all the
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
issues but
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
we have osha that oversees uh workplace
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
now we have say hospitals have their own
 
02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
now we have say hospitals have their own
committees

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with safety most organizations
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
even small businesses often have their
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
own safety standards that they develop
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
based on what their own needs are what
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
their capabilities are
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
so and again i'm not trying to determine
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
anything but
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
again how many people do we need to work
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
on a particular issue
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay man i'm sorry i didn't see your
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
hand oh it's that's why
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's in the shadow of the wall behind
 
02:09:53.679 --> 02:09:54.229 align:start position:0%
it's in the shadow of the wall behind
you

02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's okay um just i mean i think
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
for me the reason so these commissions a
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the people who testified
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
for the folk for the commissions were
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
the people who were being asked to be
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
put on these commissions
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so i think you know for
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
um there was no major backlash i think a
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the people who
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want like like you know i think
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
the people who were
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
were supportive of these commissions or
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
people who were being asked to be put on
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
these commissions so
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's why i um i mean if they if they
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
want to spend their time like if the new
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association wants to
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
get together with everybody like i think
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's i think that's a
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's up to them like the firefighters
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
want to get together that's good but
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i have like so i have nothing against
 
02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
um i have like so i have nothing against
that

02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
you muted yourself tim i did it
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
that was my bad sorry so
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're stuck in this weird
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
spot with these omnibus bills that um
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
unlike some of the omnibus bills and
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
other committees um the the various
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
sections of these bills really have
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with each other
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know these are
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
these are study committees and
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
commissions dealing with entirely
 
02:11:12.159 --> 02:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
commissions dealing with entirely
different

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
subject matter with entirely different
 
02:11:15.199 --> 02:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
subject matter with entirely different
compositions

02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
compositions
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
um you you alluded mr chairman you know
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
that there
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
there'd probably be an amendment or two
 
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
there'd probably be an amendment or two
i

02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm torn on this because i think
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know what could be arranged in
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
advance but
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
i would i would really love to see if we
 
02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
i would i would really love to see if we
could

02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
plan logistically like at the executive
 
02:11:39.599 --> 02:11:41.189 align:start position:0%
plan logistically like at the executive
session

02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
to take you know to maybe begin and i'm
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
just i'm just throwing an idea out
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know to see what comes of it to
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe take like an
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
informal pull of what sections
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
of which of the bills the committee
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
supported and then have someone run down
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
to ols
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
and come back with an amendment that you
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
know removes the parts that didn't have
 
02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:02.470 align:start position:0%
know removes the parts that didn't have
the

02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
the support of a majority of the
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee and just have like
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know a committee consensus amendment
 
02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
you know a committee consensus amendment
because

02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'd hate to see um you know i'd hate to
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
see one of the
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of the bills fail entirely
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
because a small number of us had an
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
objection with
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
one part of these unrelated sections and
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
it was enough to tip
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know a vote one way or the other um
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i i realized you know with the covet
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the the way that the senate did
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
their business and sending us these
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills it's very unfair to the
 
02:12:37.599 --> 02:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills it's very unfair to the
legislation

02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
um to to put us in the position we're in
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
of having a vote on the entire bill
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd love if we can find some way you
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
know to divide the question out
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
that would that would fit logistically
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the amendment process
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
just throwing the idea out there no i
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
think that's a great idea and one thing
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
that i'll
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
add as a as a
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
comment is that anything that gets
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
removed from these by amendments
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
would seem to me uh be fair game
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
to return again next year without
 
02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.270 align:start position:0%
to return again next year without
violating

02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
violating
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
our house rules um
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i would tend to agree with that and
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
of course
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
anything we do to amend this is going to
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
cast this right into a committee of
 
02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
cast this right into a committee of
conference

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a chance that anything could
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
be put right back
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
in again even if we choose to remove it
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i think it's all fair game i i don't
 
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:42.870 align:start position:0%
but i think it's all fair game i i don't
think

02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling and i could be dead
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
wrong but i have the feeling the
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
would like to pass these in some form
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
but the question one of the basic
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions is do we want a commission
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
do we want a committee and what do we
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
want it to really accomplish um i
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to pick apart too much of
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
what they've done but uh
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
tim you bring up some really good points
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
we ought to take what we feel is
 
02:14:05.599 --> 02:14:07.109 align:start position:0%
we ought to take what we feel is
workable

02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
workable
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
and what we don't see is really
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
something we
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
have control over or can actually amend
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
in any way then
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to eliminate that um i will say
 
02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
we need to eliminate that um i will say
that

02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
the senate's been generous in this they
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
they've they haven't asked for any
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee members from alleged
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
administration to be on any of these
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
they're smart so it's always easier to
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh to volunteer someone else is that
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
very smart otherwise it would be an itl
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that kind of
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
concerned me and this was
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
right back to day one when these were
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to our committee is
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
we we have aside from the testimony that
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
we've had today
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have no purpose statements
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
no you know what's what's the need
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
for this you know what's the
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead some of them just call for
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
a report without specifying
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
what the duties are yeah
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
i so in
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
in in response to to
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
tim's comment that it's not doing a
 
02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.390 align:start position:0%
tim's comment that it's not doing a
service

02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the to the legislation
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
they actually didn't give us any
 
02:15:22.639 --> 02:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
they actually didn't give us any
everything

02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
to work with to make the decision if you
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to look at it from that perspective
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
as well i mean
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's um you know not to pick on the
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
grand family's
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
piece but we don't know anything about
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
um this committee doesn't know anything
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
the situation with grand families other
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
than what we were heard today in
 
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.350 align:start position:0%
than what we were heard today in
testimony

02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
um there's been no statistics shown
 
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
of of the growing need for that i mean
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
we know it maybe
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
intuitively but but it um
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
in all of these it's just we want to
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
create this
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the commission because it's important
 
02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
but right
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
but there's no um they're there
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's no backup purpose yeah
 
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
ah i have a question yeah
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
oh sorry hold on we've got senator
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
roulard over here
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
elevate it again um i i
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm totally with you with why we're
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
doing all this and taking a look and
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
doing a poll as to where we're headed
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
um i kind of
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
liked the pilot bill i didn't before the
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so i found
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
information that came in on that that
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
maybe is a good idea i mean i'm not i
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't know a whole lot about it i went
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the other way and he was though he went
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
like he was part now he's against it so
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
there you go so i think it's a great
 
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.429 align:start position:0%
there you go so i think it's a great
idea

02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
to go through some of this to see yay or
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
nay where you're thinking
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
whether it should be yay or nay and
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether it should be a committee versus
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
i think that perhaps is the second part
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
of what we need to do
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
um and as you know janet says do we
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
want to end the commission on grand
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
families november 2022
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like they've already had a
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission for five years they've done
 
02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.230 align:start position:0%
commission for five years they've done
some

02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
great work um the stuff that was sent to
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
us by pam
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
was amazing it's online from department
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
of health and human services maybe a way
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
they can work on a way to make sure
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
people that don't have
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
access to the internet or whatever a way
 
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
access to the internet or whatever a way
to

02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
forward that information to the grand
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
families maybe
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing um to work on
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that i mean uh
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
or maybe a contact person just for grand
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
families the department of health and
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
human services
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
i mean that kind of thing i would like
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
to see i thought sharon carson did a
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
really good job
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
outlining what she wanted in this and so
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
that was really a good
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
good thing so i think it's a good idea
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
let's take a little bit of
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
how we want to do it and whether it
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
should be a commission or a committee
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
and kind of go that way or even change
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
part of whatever it is we want i mean i
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
but i like that idea before i go any
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
but i like that idea before i go any
further

02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
we need to introduce our new um

02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%

yeah too many okay so
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
you're you you're
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
agreeing with the idea of having a huge
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission may not be as productive
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
correct so i was just absorbing
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
everything everybody had to say today
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%

well welcome to legislative
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
administration we're kind of an informal
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
group because we're a smaller group
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part we've known each other
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
for years
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
and have the ch the ch there's about
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
six people on this that could be the
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
chairman is the way i look at it
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
so including senator ruler
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
but um but i think we are um
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to your input from
 
02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:56.389 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to your input from
uh

02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
from outside so thanks yeah well i'm
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
excited thank you
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me in your
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee so late in the year but i'm
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
here to help and make a difference
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
excellent um that's what we need a
 
02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:08.230 align:start position:0%
excellent um that's what we need a
difference

02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah so are there any other comments
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
about any
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
pieces of this that i didn't hear in
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
any of the comments things that
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
additional pieces of information or let
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
or or work that we can
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
shove pam's way
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to make a decision oh and i
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
did see
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
um manny's hand is still up sorry no
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're good thank you mr chair um i just
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
i just you know for me
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
at least with 142 i know that um
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
at the firefighters like or at least not
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
the firefighters but the first
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
responders they would like to study this
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
like you know in that commission so that
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
they could because i think that they
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
have some ideas about legislation but
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
they actually want to
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
do the due diligence um because it is
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know i think when we're dealing with
 
02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:57.990 align:start position:0%
you know i think when we're dealing with
because

02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
this the idea of this bill came through
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
when i was in labor
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
this was something that they were really
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
really working on and they just wanted
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do the due diligence
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
before making you know because workers
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
comp is a big
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal so um they wanted to
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
just do their due diligence so i think
 
02:21:14.479 --> 02:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
just do their due diligence so i think
that's

02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
like like i said i support i think all
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
three parts of 142
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's why i think that
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
commission was
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
was important for them let me ask you a
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
question do you have
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
any concern about um
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
a possible 28a issue on this mental
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes i mean
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
i personally i would let me let me i
 
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:45.190 align:start position:0%
i personally i would let me let me i
would

02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
let me take a look real quick but i
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
would all right i don't want to put you
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
on the spot i'm just
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just suggesting that um
 
02:21:58.469 --> 02:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just i had not thought of that
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um people who come from small
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
communities for example
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
um a lot of yeah a lot of people
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of small towns don't have the
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
funds to train
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
their first responders their police and
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
their firefighters
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
in fact they have volunteers or part
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers in the fire department
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
and part-time police officers only and
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
so budgets are very very limited i had
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
not thought of that but that could be an
 
02:22:29.439 --> 02:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
not thought of that but that could be an
issue

02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is really if you take both bills
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
this is the only part
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
that is unrelated this is
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
this is actually doing something rather
 
02:22:43.359 --> 02:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
this is actually doing something rather
than

02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:22:47.350 --> 02:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
studying something um so
 
02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:48.830 align:start position:0%
studying something um so
[Music]

02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i would be
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
open to removing that
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
training for that reason
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually mr chairman uh that could come
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
in as a separate bill next year yeah
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
anything we remove i'm thinking of the
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
suicide and insurance payments
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think in the past years ago we had
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
legislation along those lines
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
for police officers um i could be wrong
 
02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
for police officers um i could be wrong
but

02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
something's stirring in the back back of
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
my brain on that
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
that could be separate legislation if it
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
yep the crickets have arrived um
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think tim tim go ahead
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd also throw out there um
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know i realize we're kind of
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
thinking a little far ahead at this
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
point but the way that the
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bills are structured um
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
lend themselves very well to being
 
02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
lend themselves very well to being
divisible

02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
divisible
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
on the floor so if if we
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in the position where for
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know logistics of of a committee
 
02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:12.389 align:start position:0%
you know logistics of of a committee
amendment

02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
won't permit us to do what we want to do
 
02:24:15.359 --> 02:24:17.670 align:start position:0%
won't permit us to do what we want to do
um

02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
personally i think it would be entirely
 
02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.349 align:start position:0%
personally i think it would be entirely
appropriate

02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
if if one of these omnibus bills
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
found its way to the floor with a
 
02:24:26.399 --> 02:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
found its way to the floor with a
recommendation

02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
in the blurb that you know the question
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
be divided
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
to take up like the
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
the training portion separately because
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's completely unrelated
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
and like structured differently from
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
from the other stuff
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
um i just you know just the the
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
direction my brain is going i hate to
 
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.349 align:start position:0%
direction my brain is going i hate to
see

02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
fail because of like one section
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
that wasn't even important to the rest
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the legislation had
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
trouble or a piece of bad legislation
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
pass or you know because it was dragged
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
along as part of a larger bill that
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
wanted and i i think that the way that
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
these omnibus bills are structured it
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
makes it very easy for us
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
um as a committee and for the house you
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
know to to kind of carve out portions
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
that we might not want to retain
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure mr chairman maybe it's
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
something for
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
for you to to speak with um speaker
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
packard about and see what he will allow
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
um in terms of like the committee
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
process for it or something but
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm just very uncomfortable um
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
with having these particular types of
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
things lumped together into one bill
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
no argument there i also think we have
 
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:48.469 align:start position:0%
no argument there i also think we have
that

02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh fallback that catch-all of
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
um this having to go back to the senate
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh where they can non-concur and and we
 
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
can maybe
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
put something together in a committee of
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
conference over
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
over an issue like that well maybe uh
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll be lucky and for the first
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
time in new hampshire history the senate
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
will just simply
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
concur with our amendment with no
 
02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:14.790 align:start position:0%
concur with our amendment with no
discussion

02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know well um
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
so that actually brings up the fact that
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is a very hard thing to schedule
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
as you can see i screwed up and and
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
missed by a half an hour
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
but it is the senate if you
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
went back to watch the senate hearings
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
on these
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
there was very little um testimony yeah
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
we had we had quite a bit but
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
um there was almost none in the senate
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure how
 
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
strong strongly supported these are
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
even in the senate i i i mean i know the
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
vote came out that way but that's pretty
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
easy pushing you know just saying hi but
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know um i wonder
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
you've missed the deadline for
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
scheduling for next week no
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay i thought you said you missed it
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
by half an hour no no no i missed the
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
scheduling when i was
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
so what what tim said about uh dividing
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
this bill um and disposing of what we
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't need and what we don't think is
 
02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
don't need and what we don't think is
appropriate

02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um i believe we can do that on this it's
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
a regular bill that's each or it's
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
regular that we can
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
amend it any way we want and
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
i say we should follow through with the
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
process um figure out what we want what
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
exec on when we have our next session
 
02:27:44.399 --> 02:27:44.950 align:start position:0%
exec on when we have our next session
again

02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
and let the chips fall where they matter
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think thursday's going to be a long
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
morning if anything it may be it may be
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
something that we're able to schedule in
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
work out the framework of of our general
 
02:27:58.640 --> 02:27:59.349 align:start position:0%
work out the framework of of our general
agreement

02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then go have lunch and send uh
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
send everything to ols to
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
let us come back and vote on it in the
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon does that sound
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
i see tim shaking his head yes or
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
nodding his head yes and mr chairman the
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
way i'm looking at it um i think it's
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
wholesome the way we're all discussing
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
it so that
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we could go on for
 
02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:23.429 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we could go on for
weeks

02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
we had 25 more people yeah
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
well it's a lot easier doug's not here
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
you can tell him
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can tell him that um so what uh
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
what um he was the first name i came up
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
with oh matt i could have used math
 
02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
with oh matt i could have used math
but

02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
so why don't you start thinking about
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll shut this off here
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
but why don't we try to think of the
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
you have to have absolutely like want to
 
02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:57.429 align:start position:0%
you have to have absolutely like want to
have

02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
everything that um has okay to have
 
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then things that absolutely can go
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
away and it wouldn't break your heart
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come back with that list
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
i would like to get
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
an understanding of whether or not we
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
think commissions
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
well that's a fundamental i i got that
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
that it really is do we want to have
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees because to me
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
if we have committees that may change my
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
whole perspective on whether or not i'm
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
going to be in favor of something or not
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
just for the new folks if there are any
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
that just means that we would be taking
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
only legislators would be on committees
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
commissions would have everyone else but
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
committees can certainly
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh request the input from anyone
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
they choose you have hearings yep
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
so um i that that wouldn't bother me
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
um right again i
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
told you my priority list i don't like
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
commissions most of all i
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't like committees second and
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't know
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
all right and i really don't think we
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
should have it go to the floor to divide
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think the question should be divided
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
right here i think we should be dividing
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
not a whole house we can't hurt it
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've got it i think we should divide
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
the question and say
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
yay to the separate legislation
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
yay and nay just kind of go from there
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
and put that forward so
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're not going to know people aren't
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to know what we heard
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
here today or did not hear for that
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
matter right
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the the ideal situation um
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
on on legislation like this um is
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
exactly that to come forward you know
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
with a consensus amendment
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
um that even if it's not unanimous you
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
know that they that the committee can
 
02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:47.349 align:start position:0%
know that they that the committee can
agree

02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
this was the consensus of the committee
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
with this weird omnibus bill
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think mr chairman your
 
02:30:55.270 --> 02:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
suggestion of um
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know giving ols a heads up and
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
having someone go down there during the
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%

discussion about how to craft the

you know i'll touch base with them today
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
but i think they'll they're going to
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
need at least an hour even for a simple
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and so um just to
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
keep that in your minds i don't
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate a complicated
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know i anything more than remove
 
02:33:03.439 --> 02:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
you know i anything more than remove
section

02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
such and such and or had two members
 
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh and or this is a committee not a
 
02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
uh and or this is a committee not a
commission

02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
i mean i i don't i don't anticipate
 
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
anything more
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
complicated than that um i understand
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
but there there's
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know a lot of committees
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
are executing and i just would hate to
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
yes you know um you know as i said i'll
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
give them a heads up and
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and and do my best but and i think
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done electronically
 
02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
mostly working remotely so
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
um you know the system exists and then
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can do it i just
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
would hate to have you expect it to be
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
